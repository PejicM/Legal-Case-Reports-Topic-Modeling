<text>224 As Weinberg J noted in Gribbles Pathology (Vic) Pty Ltd v Cassidy [2002] FCA 859 ; (2002) 122 FCR 78 at [115] , statutes commonly require the giving of notice or the invitation of submissions before a particular decision is made. The fact that a decision is preliminary (in the sense that it does not in itself affect rights without some further action being taken) does not obviate the duty to observe natural justice. Such decisions often affect ' important interests, including reputation, or legitimate expectations ' (at [115]). It is not necessary that the decision have direct or indirect legal effect ( Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564). The rules of natural justice apply where a statute confers a power to prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations unless they are excluded by plain words ( Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598).

242 The duty to accord procedural fairness regulates the exercise of power where a statute confers power on a public official ' to destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations ' ( Annetts at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ) or damage reputation ( Ainsworth at 577 8). The existence of a Part A competition notice opens the door for a range of proceedings to be issued against Telstra. In so doing, it exposes Telstra to the possibility of substantial penalties which accrue from the date of issue.</text>

<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>226 It is not the case that the Act purports to exclude the rules of natural justice. There is nothing in Pt XIB that amounts to unmistakable and unambiguous language clearly expressing an intention to exclude natural justice in connection with the issue of a Part A competition notice ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [30] per Gleeson CJ; cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 at [65] to [68] in considering s 51A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)). The fact that the Act provides for the provision of certain information in a s 151AKA(10) notice does not of itself evince an intention otherwise to exclude procedural fairness ( Miah at [139] per McHugh J) or, indeed, the possibility of the provision of further information or further consultation. The Act mandates the giving of certain information in a s 151AKA(10) notice as a minimum. Such latitude in the information to be provided is encompassed by the requirement to describe in summary form the kind of anti-competitive conduct proposed to be specified in the Part A competition notice. A "summary form" allows for a minimum but not a maximum of information to be provided. There is no inconsistency between the application of subss (9) and (10), which impose a minimum standard and a common law duty of procedural fairness ( Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [10] ).

229 The Commission contends that the requirements of procedural fairness for the issue of a Part A competition notice are less onerous than those applicable to a quasi-judicial Tribunal determining, for example, whether a person is entitled to refugee status, as in VEAL . The Commission points to the flexible nature of the duty and the need to adapt to the statutory requirements. For example, a judicial hearing with rights of appeal must precede the pecuniary consequences arising from the issue of a Part A competition notice. The Commission also challenges the impact of the reasoning in VEAL and Kioa . It emphasises the comment by Brennan J in Kioa at 628 that the person whose interests are likely to be affected by the exercise of a statutory power does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. As Brennan J recognised in Kioa , '[a] dministrative decision-making is not to be clogged' by unnecessary inquiries. That observation is particularly relevant in a statutory context where the legislature has sought to respond to the fast moving pace of telecommunications markets and, in so doing, placed the Commission under an obligation to act expeditiously.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>52 A "decision" to which the ADJR Act applies is, subject to exceptions that are not presently relevant, a decision of an administrative character made, proposed to be made, or required to be made, under an enactment or by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth under an enactment (s 3(1) of the ADJR Act). A "decision" will generally, but not always, ' entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration' ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 337 per Mason CJ, with whom Brennan and Deane JJ agreed). It will also involve a substantive determination. ' If "decision" were to embrace procedural determinations, then there would be little scope for review of "conduct" ' as expressly contemplated by s 6 of the ADJR Act ( Bond at 337).

56 As Mason CJ observed in Bond , a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5 of the ADJR Act is ' a decision which the statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision ' (at 336). It is the case that s 151AKA(10) of the Act requires a notice under that section to be given prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice pursuant to s 151AKA(2). However, the satisfaction of that statutory prerequisite involves no "decision" of an administrative character. In order to comply with s 151AKA(10) the Commission must, as I have noted, give a notice stating that the Commission proposes to issue a Part A competition notice (s 151AKA(10)(a)(i)), describing in summary form the kind of anti-competitive conduct proposed there to be specified (s 151AKA(10)(a)(ii)) and inviting the carrier to make a submission within the specified time limit (s 151AKA(10)(a)(iii)). The Commission must then consider any submission received within time (s 151AKA(10)(b)). The discharge of those statutory obligations involves no determination of a substantive nature. The issue of a s 151AKA(10) notice is an action taken prior to the ultimate decision to issue a Part A competition notice upon satisfaction of the "reason to believe" threshold. That action is procedural in character and involves no "decision" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act.

57 It follows that, there being no relevant "decision", it is unnecessary to consider whether an extension of time should be granted under the ADJR Act to review the "decision" to issue the Consultation Notice.

58 That leaves for consideration whether the Commission's conduct in issuing the Consultation Notice is reviewable "conduct" within s 6 of the ADJR Act. No specific time limit applies to the review of conduct. "Conduct" engaged in for the purpose of making a decision includes ' the doing of any act or thing preparatory to the making of the decision ', including the taking of evidence or the holding of an inquiry or investigation (s 3(5) of the ADJR Act). It ' points to action taken, rather than a decision made, for the purpose of making a reviewable decision '. Conduct is ' essentially procedural and not substantive in character ' ( Bond at 341 2).

59 The issue of the Consultation Notice was more than merely a preparatory step in the deliberative or reasoning process of the reviewable decision to issue the Competition Notice ( Bond at 342). The issue of the Consultation Notice was "conduct" of the Commission within the meaning of s 6 of the ADJR Act and therefore reviewable pursuant to s 6 of the ADJR Act. It is also, in my view, amenable to review pursuant to s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act .

60 The parties accept that s 39B of the Judiciary Act applies to the decision to issue the Competition Notice. Section 151AQA of the Act contemplates an application to the Court under s 39B(1) in relation to that decision and prevents the Court from staying the process to issue the notice pending the finalisation of the application.

61 The Commission submits that the statutory scheme does not contemplate there being a reviewable decision or conduct in connection with the issue of a s 151AKA(10) notice. It relies on two matters in so doing. First, there is no specific provision for such review. Secondly, a review at that stage of the process would, the Commission submits, be contrary to the requirement for the Commission to proceed expeditiously once it has "reason to suspect" that there has been a contravention of the competition rule. The Commission points out that it would be unable to complete the process of forming a "reason to believe" under s 151AKA(8) if persons were able to invoke s 39B of the Judiciary Act before the Commission had received and considered the written submissions as contemplated by s 151AKA(10).

62 There are a number of reasons why the Commission's submissions should not be accepted. There is no clear language excluding the right to invoke s 39B of the Judiciary Act . Importantly, s 39B(1A)(c) confers jurisdiction on the Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament other than an exception which does not apply here. The decision to issue the Consultation Notice is a matter arising by reason of Pt XIB of the Act. It is within jurisdiction whether it be considered a "decision" or "conduct" for the purposes of the ADJR Act. Further, in any event, it is accepted that there is jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act to review the Competition Notice. As Optus submits and the Commission accepts, a valid s 151AKA(10) notice is a prerequisite to the issue of a valid Part A competition notice. An assessment of whether the Consultation Notice complies with s 151AKA(10) is a necessary incident to the Court's review of the Commission's decision to issue the Competition Notice.

63 The discretionary matters raised by the Commission as to the appropriateness, in certain circumstances, of review of a s 151AKA(10) notice do not go to jurisdiction but to discretion in the granting of relief. If such relief is sought at an early stage, such as prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice and before any final or operative or determinative decision has been made, relief may be denied on substantive or discretionary grounds (Robertson A, "The administrative law jurisdiction of the Federal Court Is the AD(JR) Act still important?" (2003) 24 ABR 89 at 94).</text>

<tocase>Burswood Management Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) (1990) 23 FCR 144</tocase>
<text>257 It is accepted by the Commission that Telstra is a person ' entitled to make an application to [the Court]... under section 5 ' in relation to the decision to issue the Competition Notice (s 13(1)). The Commission submits, however, that that decision is a decision in connection with the institution or conduct of proceedings in a civil court and, by the application of para (f) of Sch 2 to the ADJR Act, not a decision to which s 13 of the ADJR Act applies. The Commission relies on the following matters in support of that submission:
 
 &#8226; The investigative nature of the Commission's role in deciding whether to issue a Part A competition notice, including the "reason to believe" threshold; 
 &#8226; The close connection between the institution of proceedings in a civil court and the issue of a Part A competition notice, including the institution of proceedings for the recovery of pecuniary penalties, as emphasised by Telstra in its submissions as to the effect of a Part A competition notice; 
 &#8226; The breadth of the expression "in connection with" as used in para (f) of Sch 2 ( Burswood Management Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) (1990) 23 FCR 144 at 146); and
 &#8226; Authority to the effect that a decision to issue a s 155 notice is not a decision to which s 13 of the ADJR applies ( Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd v Bannerman (1981) 56 FLR 443).</text>

<tocase>Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>179 In circumstances where the s 151AKA(10) notice and the Part A competition notice fulfil their statutory function, the carrier or carriage service provider is given sufficient information to enable it to alter its conduct and/or make submissions to the Commission in response to the s 151AKA(10) notice. In those circumstances, the statutory opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues has been given ( Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591).

180 I have concluded that the Consultation Notice did not comply with s 151AKA(10) of the Act and that the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice. The Commission was required to and did not describe in summary form in the Consultation Notice or otherwise give to Telstra by way of additional information, the kind of anti-competitive conduct that was specified in the Competition Notice.

181 Telstra was not given a reasonable opportunity to consult, or to comment and make submissions, or to change its conduct to avoid the issue of the Competition Notice. Telstra was denied the opportunity to be heard in respect of the new and different subject matter. The statutory scheme, which included the right to such opportunity in order to afford procedural fairness, was not complied with. It follows that Telstra was denied procedural fairness.

199 Optus contends that it would only be if the Commission were to base its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the nature of the decision that procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken and says that this was not pleaded. This was sufficiently pleaded. Telstra relies in the statement of claim upon the alleged failure on the part of the Commission to give notice of the material and analysis on which the Commission based its allegations and statements in the Competition Notice as a basis of a failure to accord procedural fairness and natural justice. Telstra does not suggest that it was entitled to material reflecting the Commission's thought processes. Nor was it entitled to the Commission's own evaluation of Telstra's conduct or information supplied by it ( Alphaone at 592).

200 The Guidelines contemplate complainants and other interested parties providing submissions to the Commission. The giving of ' careful consideration ' to those submissions is said to be one means by which the Commission endeavours to achieve its objectives (p 5 of the Guidelines). The Commission did, by media release dated 22 December 2005, invite such submissions. Telstra submits that it should be inferred that those submissions were provided by third parties and were taken into account. It points to the fact that Optus issued its detailed statement of claim against Telstra in the Optus proceeding only 6 days (including the 4 day Easter break) after the Competition Notice issued and that that makes it ' tolerably plain ' that Optus and the Commission have been working closely together.

202 Where the Consultation Notice was insufficient as described, Telstra was entitled to be given additional information to be able to provide the meaningful submission contemplated by s 151AKA(10). Where the differences between the notices were as described earlier in these reasons, it is reasonable to assume that, acting bona fide in the context of the Consultation Notice, the Commission relied upon additional material and material adverse to Telstra that went to the matters not described in the Consultation Notice. If the Commission based its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the Consultation Notice, procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken ( Alphaone at 591-2). Telstra was entitled to be given notice of that material or the substance of it. The Commission accepts that, if it was obliged to provide that material to Telstra which it denies, Telstra was not accorded procedural fairness ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2006) 68 IPR 571 at [30]). Failure to provide such information was a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice.

228 The decision to issue a Part A competition notice pursuant to s 151AKA(2) of the Act consequent upon a s 151AKA(10) notice being given was likely to affect and be adverse to Telstra's interests. In those circumstances, the Commission was required to give Telstra the opportunity to ascertain the relevant issues. Where the exercise of the statutory power attracts the requirements of procedural fairness, Telstra was entitled to put information and submissions to the Commission ( Alphaone at 591-2). The Commission was obliged to identify any issue critical to the decision to issue the Competition Notice which was not apparent from the Consultation Notice and any adverse conclusions, but not the reasoning process, which had been arrived at and which would not obviously be open on the material known to Telstra ( Alphaone at 592).</text>

<tocase>Department of Industrial Relations v Forrest (1990) 21 FCR 93</tocase>
<text>36 There is no general principle that uncertainty in an executive instrument spells invalidity ( Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 71 per Kitto J). The question is whether what has been done in fact answers the description of what the statute permits to be done in law. A statutory notice such as a s 151AKA(10) notice or a Part A competition notice (together, 'the Statutory Notices') must not be so vaguely expressed that its meaning of application is a matter of real uncertainty. The Statutory Notices must convey, with reasonable and sufficient clarity and certainty, the subject matter with which they deal and enable the recipient to know what is required if their issue is to be a valid exercise of statutory power ( Television Corporation Ltd at 70 per Kitto J; SA Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 369 per Fisher and French JJ (with whom Wilcox J agreed); Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373, 374 per the Full Court). Where different kinds of subject matter are dealt with by different statutory provisions, the Statutory Notices should specify or make clear which particular aspects of the statutory regime are referred to and/or relied upon ( Department of Industrial Relations v Forrest (1990) 21 FCR 93 at 118 per Lockhart and Hill JJ).

41 Telstra relies on observations by Lockhart and Hill JJ in Forrest at 118 to suggest, in effect, that the Consultation Notice must make explicit on its face every nuance or explanation without regard to the fact that Telstra, as the recipient, has knowledge of and understood certain of the terminology and subject matter. Their Honours in Forrest were referring to a different kind of notice: a conclusive certificate under s 34 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ('the FOI Act'). The Court there was concerned with whether that notice would be uncertain to a review Tribunal charged with the function of determining whether reasonable grounds existed for the documents the subject of the certificate to be exempt from the FOI Act. In the present case, the s 151AKA(10) notice sought information from a recipient in the industry about its own processes.

42 The purpose of a s 151AKA(10) notice is to provide the affected carrier or carriage service provider with an opportunity to make a submission to the Commission on its proposal to issue a Part A competition notice. The Commission is obliged, by the Act, to consider any such submission. To achieve its purpose, a s 151AKA(10) notice must provide sufficient detail to enable a real, practical and reasonably specific response as to whether or not the recipient is engaging in the kind of conduct alleged and whether that conduct is anti-competitive. Further, a s 151AKA(10) notice is not of a mere advisory character. It should provide sufficient information to enable consideration of a possible modification of conduct.</text>

<text>206 As I have noted earlier, where the subject matter of the Competition Notice is conduct, the recipient is entitled to know what is required of it ( Television Corporation at 70 per Kitto J). Absence of information will involve a failure to provide necessary details if, without such information, the notice will not fulfil the purpose for which it is required to be given ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Woodhams [2000] HCA 10 ; (2000) 199 CLR 370 at [33] ). However, a notice analogous to a notice before action is not intended to serve the purpose of a statement of claim if and when action is taken ( Woodhams at [35] and [37]). Despite the complexity and alleged ambiguity of the Statutory Notices on which Telstra relies, in context, the conduct described is sufficiently clear within each notice.</text>

<tocase>Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>37 The severity of prospective penalties or consequences of failure to comply with a statutory notice that flow from the subject matter and the impact of the characterisation of the conduct are relevant factors in identifying the requisite degree of certainty (see Pyneboard at 374 , Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 at 208 per Hill J). Account is to be taken of the statutory context in which the issue of a statutory notice arises and of the relevant interests of third parties. To take an example relevant to a Part A competition notice, a third party may contemplate bringing an action for damages in reliance on that notice and has an interest in knowing with clarity the ambit and scope of the notice.

40 The question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the addressee of a statutory notice can fairly comply with its requirements or take advantage of the opportunity offered ( Fieldhouse at 208 per Hill J with whom Burchett J relevantly agreed). The Statutory Notices are concerned with the conduct of carriers or carriage service providers and can only be given to a carrier or a carriage service provider. In this case, the Statutory Notices were given to Telstra, a sophisticated, well-advised company with significant telecommunications experience. The notices followed a course of correspondence between Telstra and the Commission concerning the subject matter of the notices. Context may make something certain that, in the abstract, is uncertain.</text>

<tocase>George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/26.html</AustLII>
<text>109 The Commission contends that the fact that it has "reason to believe" in relation to the conduct described in the Competition Notice is a relatively low threshold. The Commission draws in aid observations directed to the phrase "reason to believe" in cases concerning s 155 of the Act. In that context, the phrase is directed to a belief that a person is capable of furnishing information or producing, for example, documents relating to a matter that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the Act. Telstra does not accept that this is analogous to the requisite reason to believe that a carrier or carriage service provider has engaged or is engaging in relevant anti-competitive conduct for the purposes of s 151AKA(8). It submits that the requisite state of mind requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person ( George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112).

110 The basis for the belief is set out in the correspondence and in the Consultation Notice. Telstra has not demonstrated that there was an absence of such belief prior to the issue of the Competition Notice. I will turn to consider the terms of the Competition Notice.

111 The Commission accepts that, if the Consultation Notice did not conform to the requirements of the Act such that no notice was given pursuant to s 151AKA(10), it was not in the position to issue a valid Part A competition notice.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/859.html</AustLII>
<text>224 As Weinberg J noted in Gribbles Pathology (Vic) Pty Ltd v Cassidy [2002] FCA 859 ; (2002) 122 FCR 78 at [115] , statutes commonly require the giving of notice or the invitation of submissions before a particular decision is made. The fact that a decision is preliminary (in the sense that it does not in itself affect rights without some further action being taken) does not obviate the duty to observe natural justice. Such decisions often affect ' important interests, including reputation, or legitimate expectations ' (at [115]). It is not necessary that the decision have direct or indirect legal effect ( Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564). The rules of natural justice apply where a statute confers a power to prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations unless they are excluded by plain words ( Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598).</text>

<tocase>Kindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove Council (2006) 143 LGERA 277</tocase>
<text>144 Optus accepts that there must be a relevant connection between the notices. It submits that the instance of anti-competitive conduct in the Competition Notice must, ' in broad terms ', be an instance of the same kind as that described in summary form in the Consultation Notice. The Commission cannot ' significantly alter ' the kind of conduct. Whether the relevant connection is maintained requires an evaluative judgment ( Kindimindi Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Cove Council (2006) 143 LGERA 277 at [54]). A narrowing or specification of the kind of conduct with greater precision is permitted but the description must, Optus submits, in substance be of the same kind of conduct.

145 The parties provided detailed schedules of all of the differences between the Consultation Notice and the Competition Notice. The Competition Notice is not meant to mirror the Consultation Notice. It is expected to be responsive to the submissions consequent on the Consultation Notice. To the extent that further definitions are included and further particulars and explanations of terms used in the Consultation Notice are given, the subject matter of the notices cannot be said to be substantively different.

146 I now turn to consider some of the differences in the Consultation Notice:
 
 &#8226; Local Services is in terms of line rental " and / or " local call services supplied to Retail Customers (para 1(a)) (my emphasis).
 &#8226; Retail Customers include the whole class of residential end-user customers (para 1(d)). 
 &#8226; The Relevant Conduct is described with reference to the Home Access increase in circumstances where there was no commensurate increase in the pricing of the range of Telstra's retail Local Services products when assessed as a weighted average (para 5).
 &#8226; The Other Conduct refers to one of the retail Local Services products, the HomeLine Part. The reference is to the HomeLine Part increase, which was for local call services but not for fixed-to-mobile, long distance and international call services (para 6). 
 &#8226; The Retail Fixed Services Market is the market for the supply of fixed services including Local Services products " as well as" fixed-to-mobile, long distance and international call services (para 8(b)) (my emphasis).
 &#8226; The conduct said to have the effect or likely effect on competition is the Relevant Conduct alone or together with the Other Conduct (para 12).
 &#8226; The "price squeeze" that is said to result from the taking advantage of market power in the Wholesale Local Services Market is the effect on "Telstra's rivals" who are Telstra's wholesale customers in the Retail Fixed Services Market and their ability to compete effectively with Telstra in that market (para 12).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>194 The Commission refused to provide Telstra with material on which it relied in coming to a decision to issue the Competition Notice and on which it based the allegations and statements in the Competition Notice which were not included in the Consultation Notice. Telstra submits that the failure on the part of the Commission to provide that information, which was necessarily significant to the decision ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 629 per Brennan J), constituted a denial of procedural fairness.

195 Optus accepts that Telstra was entitled to be informed of the nature and subject of the matter under consideration and to be afforded the right to be heard in respect of the issues on which the decision was based. However, it submits that Telstra was not entitled, at the stage of examination and consideration by the Commission, to see any material that was adverse to its interest.

227 There is no dispute that a common law duty of procedural fairness must accommodate to the statutory scheme. As stated by Mason J in Kioa at 585, the statutory power: 
 
 ' must be exercised fairly, i.e., in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements, the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes, whether public or private, which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations. '

229 The Commission contends that the requirements of procedural fairness for the issue of a Part A competition notice are less onerous than those applicable to a quasi-judicial Tribunal determining, for example, whether a person is entitled to refugee status, as in VEAL . The Commission points to the flexible nature of the duty and the need to adapt to the statutory requirements. For example, a judicial hearing with rights of appeal must precede the pecuniary consequences arising from the issue of a Part A competition notice. The Commission also challenges the impact of the reasoning in VEAL and Kioa . It emphasises the comment by Brennan J in Kioa at 628 that the person whose interests are likely to be affected by the exercise of a statutory power does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. As Brennan J recognised in Kioa , '[a] dministrative decision-making is not to be clogged' by unnecessary inquiries. That observation is particularly relevant in a statutory context where the legislature has sought to respond to the fast moving pace of telecommunications markets and, in so doing, placed the Commission under an obligation to act expeditiously.</text>

<tocase>Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [1995] HCA 60 ; (1996) 185 CLR 149</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/60.html</AustLII>
<text>222 The Commission accepts for present purposes that, consistent with authority binding on this Court ( Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [1995] HCA 60 ; (1996) 185 CLR 149), it was required to afford Telstra procedural fairness in relation to the issue of the Competition Notice at common law. Optus accepts that s 151AKA(10) of the Act does not displace the Commission's obligations of procedural fairness. The Commission wishes to reserve the question whether a common law duty exists should the occasion to contend otherwise arise but submits that, in any event and in the specific statutory context, the scope and content of that obligation have been satisfied. Put another way, the Commission says that the common law duty extends no further than what is required by s 151AKA(10). Optus submits that s 151AKA(10) reflects the procedural fairness required and that that obligation has been complied with.

223 I do not accept the Commission's submission that the requirement to afford procedural fairness takes its content only from s 151AKA(10) of the Act. While the requirements of s 151AKA(10) of the Act clearly inform the obligation to accord procedural fairness at common law they do not displace it.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>226 It is not the case that the Act purports to exclude the rules of natural justice. There is nothing in Pt XIB that amounts to unmistakable and unambiguous language clearly expressing an intention to exclude natural justice in connection with the issue of a Part A competition notice ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [30] per Gleeson CJ; cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 at [65] to [68] in considering s 51A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)). The fact that the Act provides for the provision of certain information in a s 151AKA(10) notice does not of itself evince an intention otherwise to exclude procedural fairness ( Miah at [139] per McHugh J) or, indeed, the possibility of the provision of further information or further consultation. The Act mandates the giving of certain information in a s 151AKA(10) notice as a minimum. Such latitude in the information to be provided is encompassed by the requirement to describe in summary form the kind of anti-competitive conduct proposed to be specified in the Part A competition notice. A "summary form" allows for a minimum but not a maximum of information to be provided. There is no inconsistency between the application of subss (9) and (10), which impose a minimum standard and a common law duty of procedural fairness ( Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [10] ).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council [2002] NSWCA 288 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 381</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/288.html</AustLII>
<text>196 Optus relies upon a number of propositions as expounded by Mason P in Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council [2002] NSWCA 288 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 381 at [250] and following. In particular, it adopts what his Honour said at [267] to the effect that, if Telstra were entitled to see adverse submissions of third parties, the whole process would be unworkable ' because it would lead to an infinite regression of counter disputation ' and, at [251] that, while there is no exclusion of an obligation of procedural fairness at the examination and report stage, an obligation to provide any submission supportive of an adverse proposal ' effectively converts the examination and report stage of the process into a full-blown adversarial trial '.

198 As Mason P discussed in South Sydney City Council , a party is entitled to be provided with the opportunity to address issues upon which an adverse finding is based. As his Honour noted at [259], much depends on the nature of the investigation, the specificity and importance of the "adverse" recommendation, the nature of the interest affected and the likelihood of it being anticipated as a matter to be addressed. His Honour gave as an example of the effect of specific interest and direct impact of adverse material the facts in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966. In the present case, the circumstances include the statutory framework of the decisions, the purposes of the notices, the confidentiality of third party submissions and the ability to obtain the information in subsequent legal proceedings.</text>

Telstra refers to Mison v Randwick Municipal Council (1991) 23 NSWLR 734 at 737 and submits that, by 'significantly altering ' the content of the Competition Notice from what had been foreshadowed in the Consultation Notice, the Commission changed the nature of the content.</text>

<tocase>Murphy v KRM Holdings Pty Ltd (1985) 8 FCR 349</tocase>
<text>258 Telstra submits that the words "in connection with", though broad, must be construed in context. In its submission, the purpose of the exclusion in para (f) is to avoid the disruption of investigative procedures or court process with the requirement to furnish reasons. It relies on the observation of Fox J in Murphy v KRM Holdings Pty Ltd (1985) 8 FCR 349 at 351 to the effect that: 
 
 ' [t] he general idea behind par (f) seems to be that civil procedure will itself take care of what s 13 seeks to achieve when it requires reasons to be given. Conversely, civil procedure is not to be complicated by the s 13 procedure' . 

 The decision to issue a Part A competition notice is said by Telstra to be distinct both from an investigation and a decision to institute or conduct proceedings.

259 There may be no correlative decision by the Commission to institute pecuniary penalty proceedings pursuant to ss 151BX and 151BY of the Act following the issue of a Part A competition notice. Further, third parties will not necessarily issue proceedings to recover damages pursuant to s 151CC of the Act. Certainty of legal proceedings, however, is not necessary for a decision to fall within the broad terms of para (f) of Sch 2. Decisions which "relate to, or may result" in the bringing of proceedings in a civil court for the recovery of pecuniary penalties expressly are included in para (f) of Sch 2 to the ADJR Act. The issue of a Part A competition notice is a prerequisite to the bringing of proceedings in this Court for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for a contravention of the competition rule (s 151BY(3)(g) of the Act). The scheme of the Act expressly contemplates that such proceedings may result from a decision by the Commission to issue a Part A competition notice. Were it not for the fact that such proceedings may result, the desired incentive for the carrier to cease the allegedly anti-competitive conduct would diminish significantly. Indeed, Telstra relies upon that very consequence of the decision in its submissions as to the requirements of common law procedural fairness.

260 The Commission's decision to issue the Competition Notice was a decision within the terms of para (f) of Sch 2 to the ADJR Act. It follows that the Commission was not obliged by s 13(1) of the ADJR Act to furnish Telstra with a statement of reasons for its decision to issue that notice.</text>

<text>240 The Commission contends that Telstra has not established that any departure from the requirements of procedural fairness was material or significant in reliance on NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [71] per Kirby J; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [87] per McHugh J in dissent but not on this point).

<tocase>Neate v Australian Securities Commission (1995) 60 FCR 518</tocase>
<text>53 The Commission accepts that the "decision" to issue the Consultation Notice is a step taken under the Act. It submits, however, that that step is determinative of nothing ( Neate v Australian Securities Commission (1995) 60 FCR 518 at 520 1); it does not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, whether arising under the Act or otherwise. At most, the decision is said by the Commission to precede ' an act (the issue of a notice under s 151AKA(10)(a)) which gives rise to a limited procedural right (to have a submission considered) and a concomitant obligation to consider it '.

54 The Commission further submits that, in any event, Telstra did not apply for a review of the alleged "decision" to issue the Consultation Notice within time (s 11(3)(b)(iii) of the ADJR Act).

55 Telstra submits that the decision to issue the Consultation Notice depended upon the exercise of a specific statutory power under s 151AKA(10) of the Act, which decision gave rise to a legal right to put submissions to the Commission and legal obligation on the Commission to consider those submissions. It was a prerequisite to the issue of a Competition Notice and therefore had, according to Telstra, operative effect and impacted directly on Telstra's legal rights and obligations. Further, Telstra submits that an extension of time to review that decision should be granted as the Commission has pointed to no prejudice arising from such an extension being granted. Optus consents to an extension of time being granted.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/53.html</AustLII>
<text>210 The historical context of statutory provisions may be referred to where appropriate to give the statutory words a meaning that will give effect to the purpose of the legislation ( Newcastle City Council v GIO General Limited [1997] HCA 53 ; (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 112 per McHugh J). That may include a relevant report laid before Parliament where that report was part of that background and, for example, is referred to in the explanatory memorandum ( Newcastle City Council at 100).

211 In September 2001, the Productivity Commission issued a report titled "Telecommunications Competition Regulation" (Productivity Commission, Telecommunications Competition Regulation , Report No. 16 (2001) ('the Productivity Report')). The Productivity Report contained an observation that there appeared to be no requirements for the Commission to publish its reasons for a decision to issue or not to issue a Part A competition notice (at 161).

212 The 2002 Amending Act implemented the Government's response to the Productivity Report. In part, the 2002 Amending Act contained measures to enhance accountability and transparency of decision making under Pt XIB of the Act. Those measures required the Commission to publish guidelines on the exercise of its powers (Pt 9 of the 2002 Amending Act; now s 151AP(3) and (4)) and to "consult" prior to the issue of a Part A competition notice (Pt 15 of the 2002 Amending Act; now s 151AKA(9) and (10)). The recommendations of the Productivity Report were not adopted universally by Parliament in the 2002 Amending Act. To the extent that Telstra refers to the Productivity Report, it must be read with this in mind.</text>

<tocase>Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 57 FLR 368</tocase>
<text>36 There is no general principle that uncertainty in an executive instrument spells invalidity ( Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 71 per Kitto J). The question is whether what has been done in fact answers the description of what the statute permits to be done in law. A statutory notice such as a s 151AKA(10) notice or a Part A competition notice (together, 'the Statutory Notices') must not be so vaguely expressed that its meaning of application is a matter of real uncertainty. The Statutory Notices must convey, with reasonable and sufficient clarity and certainty, the subject matter with which they deal and enable the recipient to know what is required if their issue is to be a valid exercise of statutory power ( Television Corporation Ltd at 70 per Kitto J; SA Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 369 per Fisher and French JJ (with whom Wilcox J agreed); Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373, 374 per the Full Court). Where different kinds of subject matter are dealt with by different statutory provisions, the Statutory Notices should specify or make clear which particular aspects of the statutory regime are referred to and/or relied upon ( Department of Industrial Relations v Forrest (1990) 21 FCR 93 at 118 per Lockhart and Hill JJ).

37 The severity of prospective penalties or consequences of failure to comply with a statutory notice that flow from the subject matter and the impact of the characterisation of the conduct are relevant factors in identifying the requisite degree of certainty (see Pyneboard at 374 , Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 at 208 per Hill J). Account is to be taken of the statutory context in which the issue of a statutory notice arises and of the relevant interests of third parties. To take an example relevant to a Part A competition notice, a third party may contemplate bringing an action for damages in reliance on that notice and has an interest in knowing with clarity the ambit and scope of the notice.

39 The Statutory Notices should be reasonably construed and the requirement for clarity is not to be applied ' in a precious or hypercritical fashion ' ( Pyneboard at 375). Nor should the Statutory Notices themselves be construed as statutory provisions: '[a] rtificial dissection, in the cause of determined obfuscation, can introduce an argumentative element of uncertainty into words which, when read reasonably in context, are adequate to convey a plain and clear meaning ' of what is required ( Pyneboard at 375). The Statutory Notices need not plead all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the Act ( SA Brewing at 370 per Fisher and French JJ).</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/22.html</AustLII>
<text>201 As Gaudron J said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at [99] , the basic principle of procedural fairness is an opportunity to meet the opposing case, although this does not mean that all material which comes before the decision-maker must be disclosed ( Miah at [140] per McHugh J).

225 As pointed out by Aronson M, Dyer B and Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, Lawbook Co., 2004) at 438 41, it is common for statutes to impose procedural requirements which might otherwise be imposed by the rules of natural justice without indicating what effect these express requirements are intended to have on the application of ordinary principles of natural justice. The authors conclude that the presence of express procedural requirements will not normally, of itself, exclude or limit the application of natural justice. The common law rules of natural justice are taken to apply to the exercise of public power unless clearly excluded ( Miah at [126] per McHugh J). The content of the duty is determined in the statutory context (at [130]).

226 It is not the case that the Act purports to exclude the rules of natural justice. There is nothing in Pt XIB that amounts to unmistakable and unambiguous language clearly expressing an intention to exclude natural justice in connection with the issue of a Part A competition notice ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [30] per Gleeson CJ; cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 at [65] to [68] in considering s 51A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)). The fact that the Act provides for the provision of certain information in a s 151AKA(10) notice does not of itself evince an intention otherwise to exclude procedural fairness ( Miah at [139] per McHugh J) or, indeed, the possibility of the provision of further information or further consultation.

Such latitude in the information to be provided is encompassed by the requirement to describe in summary form the kind of anti-competitive conduct proposed to be specified in the Part A competition notice. A "summary form" allows for a minimum but not a maximum of information to be provided. There is no inconsistency between the application of subss (9) and (10), which impose a minimum standard and a common law duty of procedural fairness ( Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [10] ).</text>

<text>257 It is accepted by the Commission that Telstra is a person ' entitled to make an application to [the Court]... under section 5 ' in relation to the decision to issue the Competition Notice (s 13(1)).

 &#8226; The investigative nature of the Commission's role in deciding whether to issue a Part A competition notice, including the "reason to believe" threshold;

As with s 155 notices, the Statutory Notices are to be reasonably construed and terms used in them ' will ordinarily take their meaning ' from the commercial circumstances in which the notices are given ( SA Brewing at 369 citing Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175 6).</text>

<text>240 The Commission contends that Telstra has not established that any departure from the requirements of procedural fairness was material or significant in reliance on NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [71] per Kirby J; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [87] per McHugh J in dissent but not on this point). Even if there were deficiencies in the Statutory Notices, the Commission submits that the anti-competitive conduct there described may be sufficiently clear that Telstra suffered no prejudice ( Salim v Loh [2005] FCA 372 at [4] , [32]).</text>

<tocase>Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1963/30.html</AustLII>
<text>36 There is no general principle that uncertainty in an executive instrument spells invalidity ( Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 71 per Kitto J). The question is whether what has been done in fact answers the description of what the statute permits to be done in law. A statutory notice such as a s 151AKA(10) notice or a Part A competition notice (together, 'the Statutory Notices') must not be so vaguely expressed that its meaning of application is a matter of real uncertainty. The Statutory Notices must convey, with reasonable and sufficient clarity and certainty, the subject matter with which they deal and enable the recipient to know what is required if their issue is to be a valid exercise of statutory power ( Television Corporation Ltd at 70 per Kitto J; SA Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 369 per Fisher and French JJ (with whom Wilcox J agreed); Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373, 374 per the Full Court). Where different kinds of subject matter are dealt with by different statutory provisions, the Statutory Notices should specify or make clear which particular aspects of the statutory regime are referred to and/or relied upon ( Department of Industrial Relations v Forrest (1990) 21 FCR 93 at 118 per Lockhart and Hill JJ).

206 As I have noted earlier, where the subject matter of the Competition Notice is conduct, the recipient is entitled to know what is required of it ( Television Corporation at 70 per Kitto J). Absence of information will involve a failure to provide necessary details if, without such information, the notice will not fulfil the purpose for which it is required to be given ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Woodhams [2000] HCA 10 ; (2000) 199 CLR 370 at [33] ). However, a notice analogous to a notice before action is not intended to serve the purpose of a statement of claim if and when action is taken ( Woodhams at [35] and [37]). Despite the complexity and alleged ambiguity of the Statutory Notices on which Telstra relies, in context, the conduct described is sufficiently clear within each notice.</text>

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2006) 68 IPR 571</tocase>
<text>202 Where the Consultation Notice was insufficient as described, Telstra was entitled to be given additional information to be able to provide the meaningful submission contemplated by s 151AKA(10). Where the differences between the notices were as described earlier in these reasons, it is reasonable to assume that, acting bona fide in the context of the Consultation Notice, the Commission relied upon additional material and material adverse to Telstra that went to the matters not described in the Consultation Notice. If the Commission based its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the Consultation Notice, procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken ( Alphaone at 591-2). Telstra was entitled to be given notice of that material or the substance of it. The Commission accepts that, if it was obliged to provide that material to Telstra which it denies, Telstra was not accorded procedural fairness ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2006) 68 IPR 571 at [30]). Failure to provide such information was a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice.</text>

<tocase>The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/49.html</AustLII>
<text>246 The Commission does not accept Telstra's characterisation of the consequences of a Part A competition notice as "extraordinary" and "punitive". It points out that such a notice is an exercise of executive rather than judicial power and cannot be "breached". It contends that the Competition Notice ' simply indicates that [the Commission] has reached the "relatively low threshold of 'reason to believe'" in relation to the conduct described in the notice '. That imports a requirement to come to the view in good faith and on reasonable grounds that Telstra is breaching or has breached the competition rule. There is no "finding" that Telstra has engaged or is proposing to engage in anti-competitive conduct, just a public announcement that the Commission has "reason to believe" that Telstra has engaged in at least one instance of anti-competitive conduct of a kind described in the Competition Notice. This is described as a ' relatively low threshold ' ( The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [130] per Callinan J). The Commission does not accept that this involves damage to Telstra's reputation.

247 No penalties or orders flow directly from the Competition Notice; it allows proceedings to be commenced. The Commission points out that the consequences of the Competition Notice could have been avoided by Telstra if Telstra had accepted the Commission's invitation to give undertakings not to engage in the impugned conduct or successfully sought an exemption order pursuant to s 151AS of the Act. If Telstra were able to satisfy the Commission that the conduct was not anti-competitive or that the benefit to the public outweighs the detriment constituted by any lessening of competition, the Commission could make an exemption order (s 151BC(1) of the Act).

248 However, such an undertaking or the seeking of an exemption order would involve an acknowledgement by Telstra that its conduct or proposed conduct was anti-competitive, a proposition that it does not accept. The issue of a Part A competition notice should not force a recipient to accept the veracity of the allegations made which it disputes.</text>

<tocase>Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265</tocase>
<text>236 As Finn J observed in Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 274, the courts have indicated in a variety of contexts that '[c] onsultation is no empty term ' nor ' a mere formality '. The Commission has been given extensive powers which have been granted and affirmed in the context of certain conditions. The statutory process of consultation envisaged by s 151AKA(9) and (10) is rendered ineffective if the recipient is not given adequate and appropriate information in order to make an informed response.

237 Telstra was not afforded the opportunity to address issues relevant to the issue of the Competition Notice. Procedural fairness required that Telstra have that opportunity, whether such natural justice was in accordance with the statutory regime or common law principles.

238 Optus relies upon the context of the statutory power being exercised under a scheme in which the Part A competition notice:
 
 (a) does not prevent Telstra from engaging in the conduct referred to in the notice;
 (b) is not evidence of the matters referred to in it;
 (c) is akin to a notice before action, in the sense that a person (including the Commission) has no right to sue for a breach of the competition rule unless a Part A competition notice has been issued; and
 (d) may lead to the possibility of proceedings after its issue (in which proceedings the allegation of a breach of the competition rule will have to be proved to the civil standard of proof).</text>

<text>197 Optus also points to the decision of the Full Court in VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 559 at [27] where it was pointed out that the analysis of whether natural justice is afforded:
 
 'is not a process of syllogistic reasoning. One does not approach it thus: the person is entitled to adverse material, this material was relied on in reaching an adverse result, that makes it adverse material, it was not provided in terms, therefore there has been a failure to afford natural justice.'</text>
