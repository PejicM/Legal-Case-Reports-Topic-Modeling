<tocase>Outboard Marine Australia Pty Ltd v Byrnes [1974] 1 NSWLR 27</tocase>
<text>13 One available inference is that he simply gave the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings no thought or consideration prior to November 2007. If an extension of time is sought, it remains a matter for the party seeking the extension to set forth a factual basis upon which the discretion may properly be exercised. Rules of court, particularly those relating to time, should never be allowed to become an " instrument of tyranny ": see Outboard Marine Australia Pty Ltd v Byrnes [1974] 1 NSWLR 27 at 30. But prima facie , they must be obeyed. The factual basis upon which Mr von Arnim is seeking an extension of time is, it is considered, not sufficient to justify an exercise of discretion in his favour. Even had an extension of time been granted, leave to appeal would also not have been granted.

14 The fact remains, however, that the trustee was given notice and no election was made within the 28 day period prescribed by s 60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act .

15 The orders of the Court are:
 
1. The proceedings be dismissed.
 

 
2. The Applicant to pay the Respondent's costs, including reserved costs, as agreed or taxed.

 I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.
