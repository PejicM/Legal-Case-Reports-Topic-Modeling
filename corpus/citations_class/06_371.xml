<tocase>Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405</tocase>
<text>12 AACo submits that where a party propounds a positive case that it possessed a certain state of mind, it opens up for examination and testing by the Court any evidence as to its actual state of mind. AACo submits that a defence which specifically invokes a positive state of mind is inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege over documents which contributed to that state of mind. As a consequence, AACo submits AMP has necessarily waived privilege in relation to its legal advice. AACo relies upon Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 411; Telstra Corporation Ltd &amp; Anor v BT Australasia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1998) 85 FCR 152 at 166-7; Fort Dodge Australia Pty Ltd v Nature Vet Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 501 at [11] ; BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1302 at [17] ; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1336 at [40] [42].

30 Many decisions of this and other courts have considered circumstances in which, by its pleadings, a party waives its legal professional privilege. In Fort Dodge , the respondent, in its defence to a claim of misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a contract, alleged that it had entered into the contract on the basis of representations made by the applicant. As such, it raised a positive case with respect to its state of mind at the time of entering into the contract. Hely J (at [11]) found that by doing so, the respondent:
 
 'opened up for examination and testing the source of, and the basis for, that state of mind. Where a party makes allegations raising the issue of its state of mind, to which legal advice is likely to have contributed, the party cannot continue to claim legal professional privilege for that advice: Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405'. 

Hely J determined that the pleading of the state of mind was inconsistent 'with the continued maintenance of confidentiality of contemporaneous legal advice as to those matters' (see at [14]).

35 In the present case, the belief pleaded by AMP is not intimately connected with the legal advice given to it at the time: cf Ampolex per Giles CJ Comm D at 411F. AMP's defence does not make assertions as to the content of legal advice given to it; nor does AMP's defence state that its decision to accept the tender of Nebo was based upon legal advice: cf Rio Tinto. AMP does not assert a belief in particular legal requirements or consequences, which could be reasonably expected to have been predicated upon legal advice, in which case legal advice might be material evidence in the proceedings. Rather, AMP has pleaded its belief with respect to the best commercial option which was open to it, a belief informed primarily by commercial advice from Rabo. In these circumstances I do not consider that AMP's pleadings are inconsistent with the maintenance of its legal professional privilege.</text>

<text>12 AACo submits that where a party propounds a positive case that it possessed a certain state of mind, it opens up for examination and testing by the Court any evidence as to its actual state of mind. AACo submits that a defence which specifically invokes a positive state of mind is inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege over documents which contributed to that state of mind. As a consequence, AACo submits AMP has necessarily waived privilege in relation to its legal advice. AACo relies upon Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 411; Telstra Corporation Ltd &amp; Anor v BT Australasia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1998) 85 FCR 152 at 166-7; Fort Dodge Australia Pty Ltd v Nature Vet Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 501 at [11] ; BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1302 at [17] ; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1336 at [40] [42].

18 AMP also submits that the facts in these proceedings are distinguishable from those in Fort Dodge v Nature Vet where the respondent's state of mind became an issue when the respondent introduced it (see at [11] and [14]).

19 AMP further submits that if AACo's submissions are accepted, the consequence would be that in any case in which an applicant placed the respondent's state of mind in issue, the respondent would risk waiving privilege if it did any more than file a mere denial to the claim made against it. AMP submits that such result would be absurd.

20 AMP submits in the alternative that if the Court should find that there has been a waiver of privilege, such waiver cannot extend to advice received throughout the whole of the tender process, since only a limited period is referable to the defence.

30 Many decisions of this and other courts have considered circumstances in which, by its pleadings, a party waives its legal professional privilege. In Fort Dodge , the respondent, in its defence to a claim of misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a contract, alleged that it had entered into the contract on the basis of representations made by the applicant. As such, it raised a positive case with respect to its state of mind at the time of entering into the contract. Hely J (at [11]) found that by doing so, the respondent:
 
 'opened up for examination and testing the source of, and the basis for, that state of mind. Where a party makes allegations raising the issue of its state of mind, to which legal advice is likely to have contributed, the party cannot continue to claim legal professional privilege for that advice: Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405'. 

Hely J determined that the pleading of the state of mind was inconsistent 'with the continued maintenance of confidentiality of contemporaneous legal advice as to those matters' (see at [14]).

34 However, I cannot accept the submission of AACo that any positive defence mounted by AMP which raises its state of mind necessarily constitutes a waiver of privilege. In my opinion, in order to waive privilege a party must assert a belief which is likely to have been, or is explicitly said to have been, materially dependent upon legal advice given to that party. In that case the proof or otherwise of the belief is dependent upon the legal advice and accordingly privilege is waived. This is the position in cases where the dispute relates to a party's understanding of its legal position at a given point in time, such as Thomason , Rio Tinto, Ampolex and Fort Dodge .</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>17 AMP submits that the decision in Telstra v BT and other cases propounding a 'state of mind' test should not be relied upon in view of the subsequent decision of the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 which established the inconsistency test. Additionally, AMP says the 'state of mind' test only arises in circumstances where the issue of state of mind was raised by the party claiming privilege, which is not the position in the present case.

22 AMP says that the observations in the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in Mann v Carnell at [122], which are relied upon by AACo are inconsistent with the reasons of the majority at [30] and [35] of that decision.

23 Since these proceedings are interlocutory, common law principles with respect to legal professional privilege apply: see Mann v Carnell at 12 [27], 16-17 [41], 45 [143] and 45 [144] and DSE (Holdings) Pty Limited at 504 [11].

24 The test for waiver of legal professional privilege at common law was enunciated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell . In that case, a majority of the Court at [28]:
 
 'It is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege.'

25 The Court added at [29]:
 
 'What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.'

26 Prior to the decision in Mann v Carnell , the leading authority of this Court relating to waiver of legal professional privilege was Telstra Corporation v BT Australasia . In that case, Branson and Lehane JJ observed (at 166):
 
 'A party who initiates an undue influence case puts in issue in the proceeding the quality of his or her consent or assent ... The quality of such consent or assent will ordinarily be affected by relevant legal advice received by the party. The principle that requires that in such circumstances the party not be entitled to maintain the confidentiality of such advice is one of fairness which goes to the integrity of the legal process. To allow a party to put in issue the quality of his or her consent or assent whilst, at the same time, withholding evidence relevant to that issue, would be to allow him or her unfairly to handicap the opposing party to the proceeding, and to compromise the ability of the court realistically to determine the issue.'

28 The effect of Mann v Carnell upon the ratio in Telstra was considered by Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc , where his Honour said (at 501-502 [4]-[5]):
 
 'I have come to the view that the authorities in this Court may require me to be guided by what the majority of the Full Court said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 152, as necessarily modified by Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 12 [27] and 13 [29] ... 
 
 My own view is that Mann v Carnell evinces more than a modification of the approach of the majority in Telstra and amounts to a rejection of that approach and that the notion of inconsistency of conduct by the holder of the privilege and the maintenance of the confidence in question (though informed where relevant by notions of fairness) works a narrower and more confined operation for implied waiver than as expressed by the majority in Telstra .'

29 I respectfully agree with his Honour with respect to the effect of Mann v Carnell . To the extent that Telstra suggests that fairness is the overriding consideration, it should not be followed. It is clear that following Mann v Carnell , inconsistency of conduct should be the guiding principle in determining whether legal professional privilege has been waived, although fairness remains an element for consideration in determining whether conduct is inconsistent.

36 In respect of AACo's second submission, namely that AMP waived its privilege by communicating its legal advice to Rabo, I consider that the applicant must also fail. In Mann v Carnell , the majority observed that the reasoning of all members of the Court in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 'was inconsistent with the proposition that any voluntary disclosure to a third party necessarily waives privilege': see Mann v Carnell at 14 [30]. The majority also noted the observations of Jordan CJ in Thomason at 355, where his Honour said:
 
 'The mere fact that a person on some one occasion chooses to impart to another or others advice which he has received from his solicitor indicates no intention on his part to waive his right to refuse on other occasions to disclose in evidence what that advice was, and supplies no sufficient reason for depriving him of a form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client.'

37 In view of these authorities, the disclosure of legal advice in confidence to a commercial adviser cannot, in my opinion, be considered inconsistent with the retention of privilege. In this respect, McHugh J's observations in Mann v Carnell at [120] are inconsistent with the majority reasoning.

38 For the above reasons, the Court orders that:
 
1. The applicant's notice of motion be dismissed.
 
2. The applicant pay the respondents' costs of the motion.
 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy.

<text>12 AACo submits that where a party propounds a positive case that it possessed a certain state of mind, it opens up for examination and testing by the Court any evidence as to its actual state of mind. AACo submits that a defence which specifically invokes a positive state of mind is inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege over documents which contributed to that state of mind. As a consequence, AACo submits AMP has necessarily waived privilege in relation to its legal advice. AACo relies upon Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 411; Telstra Corporation Ltd &amp; Anor v BT Australasia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1998) 85 FCR 152 at 166-7; Fort Dodge Australia Pty Ltd v Nature Vet Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 501 at [11] ; BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1302 at [17] ; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1336 at [40] [42].

32 In Rio Tinto , Sundberg J stated (at [43]):
 
 '... the question whether the respondent has acted in a manner inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege remains. In my opinion, however one approaches the question (as to which see [44] and [45]), he has so acted. The inconsistency arises from the combination of the following three facts: 
 
 
 &#8226; the respondent has, by his Statement, raised as an issue in the instant proceedings his states of mind; 
 &#8226; the respondent has, by his response to the applicant's request for particulars of his Statement, disclosed that the privileged scheduled documents had a bearing on those states of mind; and 
 &#8226; the respondent has refused to produce those documents in answer to the first notice to produce.'

33 The above authorities establish that the conduct of a party will be inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege if the nature and extent of legal advice has been raised, whether directly or by necessary implication, by that party as an issue in the proceedings. This will usually occur where a state of mind has been positively pleaded in circumstances where legal advice given would be specifically pertinent to the formation of that state of mind or where a party's understanding of their legal position is critical to their defence.

35 In the present case, the belief pleaded by AMP is not intimately connected with the legal advice given to it at the time: cf Ampolex per Giles CJ Comm D at 411F. AMP's defence does not make assertions as to the content of legal advice given to it; nor does AMP's defence state that its decision to accept the tender of Nebo was based upon legal advice: cf Rio Tinto. AMP does not assert a belief in particular legal requirements or consequences, which could be reasonably expected to have been predicated upon legal advice, in which case legal advice might be material evidence in the proceedings. Rather, AMP has pleaded its belief with respect to the best commercial option which was open to it, a belief informed primarily by commercial advice from Rabo. In these circumstances I do not consider that AMP's pleadings are inconsistent with the maintenance of its legal professional privilege.</text>

<tocase>Thomason v The Council of the Municipality of Campbelltown (1939) 39 SR(NSW) 347</tocase>
<text>31 In Thomason v The Council of the Municipality of Campbelltown (1939) 39 SR(NSW) 347 the New South Wales Court of Appeal was required to decide whether privilege was waived in respect of advice concerning the legal remedies available to the plaintiff, where the exclusive election of a particular remedy was only binding if a person had knowledge of their other options at the time the election was made. In respect of the privilege Jordan CJ said (at 358-9):
 
 'Hence, in effect, one of the issues in the case was what advice if any the plaintiff had received from her legal advisers as to her alternative legal rights. In these circumstances, since the fact and nature of the advice is an issue in the case, I am of opinion that privilege cannot be raised to prevent the proof of the advice.'

34 However, I cannot accept the submission of AACo that any positive defence mounted by AMP which raises its state of mind necessarily constitutes a waiver of privilege. In my opinion, in order to waive privilege a party must assert a belief which is likely to have been, or is explicitly said to have been, materially dependent upon legal advice given to that party. In that case the proof or otherwise of the belief is dependent upon the legal advice and accordingly privilege is waived. This is the position in cases where the dispute relates to a party's understanding of its legal position at a given point in time, such as Thomason , Rio Tinto, Ampolex and Fort Dodge .

36 In respect of AACo's second submission, namely that AMP waived its privilege by communicating its legal advice to Rabo, I consider that the applicant must also fail. In Mann v Carnell , the majority observed that the reasoning of all members of the Court in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 'was inconsistent with the proposition that any voluntary disclosure to a third party necessarily waives privilege': see Mann v Carnell at 14 [30]. The majority also noted the observations of Jordan CJ in Thomason at 355, where his Honour said:
 
 'The mere fact that a person on some one occasion chooses to impart to another or others advice which he has received from his solicitor indicates no intention on his part to waive his right to refuse on other occasions to disclose in evidence what that advice was, and supplies no sufficient reason for depriving him of a form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client.'</text>
