<tocase>Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 261</tocase>
<text>10 Even if the offer made by the respondents by letter dated 27 March 2007 was commensurate with the overall financial result to flow from the orders I made on 30 July 2008, and I hasten to add that I do not think it is, the ground on which the motion is brought is misconceived. As Lockhart J said in Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 261 at 269: 
 'The primary purpose of an award of pre-judgment interest is to compensate a successful plaintiff for the loss or detriment which he or she has suffered by being kept out of his or her money during the relevant period; that is to compensate the plaintiff for having been deprived of the use of the money: Ruby v Marsh [1975] HCA 32 ; (1975) 132 CLR 642 ; Batchelor v Burke [1981] HCA 30 ; (1981) 148 CLR 448 ; and MBP (SA) Pty Limited v Gogic [1991] HCA 3 ; (1991) 171 CLR 657. See P D Finn (ed), Essays on Damages (1st ed, 1992) and in particular the essay by J L R Davis, "Interest as Compensation", pp 149-152.' 
The applicant has been without its money since 28 January 2004 and that remains the case. It is only appropriate that it should have interest on that money up to the date of judgment.

11 The motion for the vacation of Order 6 is dismissed.

12 The respondents' notice of motion seeks (at [2]) the vacation of Orders 7 and 8 made on 30 July 2008 and their variation based on the matters set out in the affidavit of Ms Ellis sworn 5 August 2005. It does not say how they should be varied. Nor do their written submissions. What the respondents' notice of motion does seek (at [3]) is an order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs (on an indemnity or, alternatively, party-party basis) from 21 April 2007 or such other time as the Court thinks fit. On the hearing of the motion, the further alternative was introduced, namely, that each party pay its own costs from that date. Presumably, implicit in all this is that the first, second and third respondents should pay the applicant's costs of the application as ordered by Order 7, but only up to 21 April 2007. On the hearing of the motion, nothing was said about the second limb of Order 7, namely, that the first, second and third respondents pay the fourth, fifth and sixth respondents' costs of defending the application. Nor was anything said about Order 8 that the cross-claimant pay the first and second cross-respondents' costs of defending the cross-claim.</text>
