<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597</tocase>
<text>13 In my opinion, the present case is to be contrasted with that which came before the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597. In that case the Immigration Review Tribunal, the procedural fairness requirements for which were materially analogous, came to decide a review application in ignorance of a request which had been made on behalf of the review applicant for a later hearing date because of an inability to attend the scheduled hearing. Because of an internal error within the Immigration Review Tribunal, that letter requesting the later hearing was not drawn to the Immigration Review Tribunal member's attention before the case was decided. Later, following representations by the visa applicant's agent, the Immigration Review Tribunal did hold a further hearing and made a second decision which was in favour of the visa applicant. The High Court by majority held that the Immigration Review Tribunal had power to make that second decision. Indeed, having regard to the reasons for judgment of certain members comprising the majority, the Immigration Review Tribunal's first decision was no decision at all because a requirement of the governing provisions had not been observed.

14 Here, though, a hearing was offered. It is just that the invitation was not availed of and the Tribunal then went on to decide the case on the basis of the material which it had before it.

15 Section 426A of the Migration Act makes provision for this type of situation. That section reads as follows:
 
 
 (1) If the applicant: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) is invited under section 425 to appear before the Tribunal; and
 (b) does not appear before the Tribunal on the day on which or at the time and place at which the applicant is scheduled to appear; 
 
 
 
 
 the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it.
 (2) This section does not prevent the Tribunal from rescheduling the applicant's appearance before or from delaying its decision on the review in order to enable the applicant's appearance before it as rescheduled.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/73.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The granting of a protection visa requires the engendering of a state of satisfaction on the part of the Minister or his delegates. There are authorities in this Court which stand, with respect unremarkably, for the proposition that it would be difficult for the Tribunal to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction, standing as it does in the place of the Minister if an applicant does not put before the Tribunal sufficient information, for example, because of an absence of attendance at a hearing. Without that "satisfaction" engendered on the part of the Tribunal, the visa application has to be rejected see amongst the authorities for this Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ.</text>

<tocase>NAFX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/287.html</AustLII>
<text>20 Indeed, some judges have gone so far as to regard the rejection of an application in that circumstance as an "inevitable consequence" of non-attendance at a hearing see NAFX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 at para 5. The bare statement provided in the visa application did not, for example, provide any basis for satisfaction in respect of an inability for the Appellants to secure state protection.

21 In these circumstances and hard though it may be, the result on the appeal is, in my opinion, clear. It must, for reasons which I have given, be dismissed.

22 The orders that I make in the appeal are:
 
1. The appeal is dismissed.
 
2. The Appellants are to pay the First Respondent's costs of and incidental to the appeal which are fixed in the amount of $2600.</text>
