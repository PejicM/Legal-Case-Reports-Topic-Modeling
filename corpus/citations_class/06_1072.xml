<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/63.html</AustLII>
<text>The High Court made it abundantly clear in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 that before an interlocutory injunction can be granted it is necessary to identify a substantive right which is to be determined at the trial and in respect of which final relief is sought. An interlocutory injunction, according to equitable principles, cannot be granted simply to preserve the status quo if no right is sought to be vindicated by final relief: see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (supra) at 218 per Gleeson CJ.

However, two of the judges in the majority in Lenah Game Meats made it clear that they were not concerned with "some special statutory jurisdiction" (per Gleeson CJ at 217; see also Gaudron J at 232) to grant injunctive relief.</text>

<tocase>Karl Suleman Enterprizes Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Babanour (2004) 49 ACSR 612</tocase>
<text>Although the investors may wish to preserve the status quo of the sale contract to see whether they may have some cause of action which might be brought by the liquidator in their name, it was not suggested that the sale contract is illegal as a result of having been entered into by participants in an unregistered managed investment scheme. There is clear authority to the contrary. In Karl Suleman Enterprizes Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Babanour (2004) 49 ACSR 612, the New South Wales Court of Appeal said at [51]: 
 
 "The registration requirement for the operation of a managed investment scheme is for the protection of investors. The legislation does not expressly make an unregistered scheme unlawful. Rather it impugns the conduct of the entity responsible for registration by imposing a penal sanction for a contravention of the registration provisions. The members of an unregistered scheme are protected by the provisions whereby the scheme may be compulsorily wound up. There is nothing, therefore, in the scheme of the legislation whereby an implication of an illegality would arise, nor is there anything that points to a legislative intention that contracts entered into as part of an unregistered scheme are illegal."

It is then necessary to consider whether the general terms of s 601EE(2) of the Act would extend to the granting of an injunction abrogating or suspending for a period of time McKinnon Road's right to rescind the sale contract. Although it is cast in general terms, s 601EE(2) must be read within the context of a provision for the winding up of a managed investment scheme. In Re Crust'N'Crumb Bakers (Wholesale) Pty Ltd [1992] 2 Qd R 76 at 78 McPherson SPJ described the concept of "winding up" as: 
 
 "a process that consists of collecting the assets, realising and reducing them to money, dealing with proofs of creditors by admitting or rejecting them, and distributing the net proceeds, after providing for costs and expenses, to the persons entitled". 


In Mier v F N Management Pty Ltd (supra) Keane JA, with whom McMurdo P and Douglas J agreed, said at 98:
 
 
 "...where a statute makes reference, without more, to the 'winding up' of an entity, it is referring to the application of a procedure containing these essential characteristics [those described by McPherson SPJ] . It follows that s 601EE(2) must be read as empowering a court to make such orders as it considers appropriate in order to apply such a procedure to an unregistered managed investment scheme. It may also be accepted that the terms of the section allow for further orders to be made as needed so long as they are required for the 'due conduct and completion of the winding up'. The necessary corollary is that an order that could not reasonably be seen as advancing this procedure would not be authorised by s 601EE(2)." (Footnotes omitted) 


In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 240, Barrett J said at 243:
 
 
 "In relation to s 601EE(2) of the Corporations Act , I accept that the powers conferred upon the court are very broad. The concept of winding up, as it is applied by s 601EE to an unregistered managed investment scheme, is not the subject of any explanation or elaboration in the statute. It seems to me, as a matter of general principle, however, that what is contemplated is the realisation of assets of the scheme, discharge of liabilities and distribution of any surplus among beneficiaries or members in an appropriate way. So much is clearly implied by the expression 'winding up', the general meaning of which may be gathered from approaches taken to that general subject under statutes dealing not only with companies but also with partnerships. Those statutory approaches were built on foundations which pre-dated legislation in either area. 
 
 Given that s 601EE(2) enables the court to make 'any orders it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme' (emphasis added), it must be accepted that the court has jurisdiction to settle or prescribe any aspect or element of the basis for winding up or the winding up process which it is necessary to supply because that element cannot be obtained from any other source. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the statute itself does not attempt to lay down the basis for or method of winding up. That is, to my mind, an indicator of intention that the court should be able to act in the comprehensive way I have outlined."</text>

In Re Stacks Managed Investments Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 466, White J expressed some doubt about the range of orders which could be made under s 601EE(2) , but he did not express any conclusion on the scope of the Court's power under that section. He agreed (at 475) with the observations of Barrett J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (supra) that: 
 
 "the power to make orders for the winding up, must extend to settling or prescribing any aspect or element of the basis of winding up or the winding-up process which cannot be supplied from other sources. Section 601EE(2) empowers the court to fashion the winding-up process." 


But White J appeared to accept that s 601EE(2) was a source of new powers not otherwise found in other provisions in the Act relating to the winding up of corporations or other entities. His Honour said at 478:
 
 
 "It [s 601NF(2)] authorises the making of directions of a kind which would be made in an administration suit for the purpose of settling the entitlements of members. But in my view, and notwithstanding the authorities under s 601EE(2) , the subsection does not authorise the court to confer additional powers upon a responsible entity to which third parties would be made subject, or to interfere with the rights which third parties would otherwise enjoy. The fact that the power is to give directions indicates that it is one to direct the responsible entity in how to perform its functions and obligations, not that it be the source of new powers. In this respect it differs from s 601EE(2)."</text>

The liquidators filed a motion in the winding up proceeding seeking an order for possession of a property owned by the scheme and an injunction restraining the occupant of the property, who claimed to be a lessee under a lease and entitled to purchase the property under an option in the lease, from remaining in possession of the property. The lessee claimed that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in the proceeding and that the Court did not have jurisdiction or power to make a substantive order resolving a dispute between the liquidators and third parties on the liquidators' interlocutory motion in the winding up proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2006/259.html</AustLII>
<text>In Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 259 , Young CJ was asked to wind up an unregistered managed investment scheme. Part of the relief sought was an injunction restraining the exercise of rights under a vendor mortgage until after inquiry by an Associate Justice. The vendor mortgage purportedly secured debts due by investors in the scheme in respect of their purchase of the subject property.

Issues had arisen as to the parties to the vendor mortgage and as to the amount due to the mortgagee under it. Young J decided to grant an injunction to preserve the status quo and to prevent the mortgagee from enforcing any rights it might have under the vendor mortgage. He did so for two reasons. First, because of the desirability of preserving rights pending determination of the issues as to the amount due to the mortgagee under the mortgage. Secondly, because there was a serious question as to breaches by the management company of its obligations to the investors which justified an enquiry.

Primelife sought to distinguish this case from the present circumstances under consideration on the basis that it involved an inter partes proceeding and a dispute about scheme property. Such a distinction is not warranted. The case involved issues as to the implementation of the winding up of the scheme and was not an inter partes proceeding in the sense that it involved a dispute outside the framework of the winding up of the scheme. Primelife contended that whereas Warne v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (supra) involved a dispute about scheme property, the issue here involved Primelife's right to rescind which could not be classified as scheme property. That distinction is not valid. Primelife's right to rescind is in respect of the sale contract, which is executory and is scheme property.

Although the investors in the present case contended that they had a cause of action available to them for misleading and deceptive conduct which would give rise to an injunction restraining enforcement of the sale contract, relying on s 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), they were not seeking the injunction for the purposes of enabling them to proceed with such a cause of action. Nor were they seeking an injunction to enable them, or for that matter, the liquidator, to institute a proceeding against the Primelife interests for not carrying out their obligations in relation to the promotion, implementation and administration of the schemes. Rather they wished the liquidator to have time to consider whether he might consider such actions being brought by him on their behalf. However, I consider such a possibility as an insufficient basis for the grant of an injunction.

Even if such causes of action might be available to the investors or to the liquidator of the schemes on their behalf, such causes of action do not depend for their existence or prosecution on the fact that the sale contract is still alive, executory and capable of being completed by transfer if there were funds or finance available to enable the sale contract to be completed. If the sale contract were to be rescinded such causes of action would still be available to the investors. Of course, whether such causes of action might be successful depends on how the investors put their case and the strength of the evidence that is available to them.

Put another way, there is no practical reason for the injunction to be granted or for the status quo in respect of the sale contract to be preserved. The investors do not suggest that they wish to complete the sale contract and they cannot obtain the finance to do so. If the sale contract is rescinded by the vendor, such causes of action as they may have available to them will not, by virtue of that rescission alone, be lost to them.

Turning to the order sought that the liquidator be entitled to bring proceedings in his name as liquidator of the schemes on behalf of the schemes and/or Kastabon and/or Novena, there are conceptual difficulties in making such an order. Novena has gone into liquidation and has been de-registered. As counsel for Primelife pointed out, the liquidator is not the liquidator of Kastabon or Novena; rather he is liquidator of the scheme. But what is the scheme? It is not a legal entity as such. Each scheme was defined in the orders of 26 September 2005 winding up the schemes as the partnership formed pursuant to the partnership agreement dated 30 June 1999 between Kastabon as manager for the investors in the Kastabon Syndicate and Novena as manager for the investors in the Novena Syndicate.</text>

<tocase>Hamilton v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker [2003] FCA 1055</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1055.html</AustLII>
<text>In Hamilton v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker [2003] FCA 1055 , Heerey J made an order entitling a liquidator of an unregistered managed investment scheme to bring proceedings in his name as liquidator of the scheme. Heerey J was faced with the potential problem of two partners in a firm of solicitors who were administering the scheme being the plaintiffs as well as partners in the defendant firm. Heerey J observed at [8] that "the provision for the winding up of an investment scheme cannot always be neatly fitted into the analogy of the winding up of a company", an observation with which I agree. His Honour noted that the scheme itself was not a legal entity and could not be a plaintiff so he gave the liquidator leave to bring the proceeding in his name as liquidator of the scheme. His Honour did not consider the nature of the structure of the scheme. However, his Honour's conclusion is not inconsistent with the conclusion I have reached which is predicated on an understanding of the contractual foundation for the schemes.

What is sought is an enabling order. In my view it is desirable that there be no doubt as to the ability of the liquidator to bring proceedings on behalf of the investors who constituted the syndicates which were the subject of the partnership agreement between Kastabon and Novena. All the proposed order will do procedurally is ensure that no challenge can be made to any proceeding brought by the liquidator on the ground that the entities which were the constituent and contracting entities which brought the schemes into existence are not properly parties to any such proceeding.

I will therefore make an order in respect of each proceeding and each scheme in the following terms: 
 
 Colin McIntosh Nicol is entitled to bring in the name 'Colin McIntosh Nicol as Liquidator of the Claremont Terrace Scheme' being the scheme defined in the schedule to the order made on 26 September 2005, any proceeding (as he may be advised) on behalf of the scheme and/or Kastabon Pty Ltd and/or Novena Holdings Pty Ltd (notwithstanding that it has been deregistered) against any person whether or not a party to this proceeding.</text>
