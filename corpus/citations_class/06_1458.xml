<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The principles governing the grant of interlocutory relief are well established, and have recently been reaffirmed by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 (' O'Neill ') at pars 19 and 65 and following. In O'Neill , the High Court affirmed the approach adopted by the High Court in Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1967-68) 118 CLR 618. At par 19, Gleeson CJ and Crennan J said:
 
 '... in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. These are the organising principles, to be applied having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case, under which issues of justice and convenience are addressed ...'

34 The next major question is where the balance of convenience lies and whether the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy. It seems to me that my approach, in this case, should mirror that of the High Court in Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited (1967 - 68) [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 625, where the Court said:
 
 'The facts which appear to us to be decisive on this question may be stated quite briefly. In April 1967, after the plaintiff had been building up in Australia a substantial business in ampicillin over a period of several years, the defendant announced its intention of marketing hetacillin in Australia. The plaintiff on 10 May 1967 warned the defendant that if it began to do so proceedings for infringement of the patents would be taken. It was in the face of this warning that the defendant commenced the acts now complained of, and the action was thereafter instituted without delay. Any goodwill the defendant may since have built up for hetacillin would of course be destroyed or damaged by granting an injunction, but that was a risk the defendant took with its eyes open. If it be not restrained, it will presumably take advantage of the time before the hearing to subject the goodwill of the plaintiff's established trade in ampicillin to the prejudice of competition from a product which the defendant maintains has some points of superiority. In no meaningful sense could matters be said to be kept in status quo if in these circumstances the defendant were left free to pursue its course, merely keeping an account of the profits it makes.' 
 

 That approach was recently reaffirmed by the High Court in O'Neill , to which I have earlier referred.</text>

<tocase>Malleys Ltd v JW Tomlin Pty Ltd [1961-62] 35 ALJR 352</tocase>
<text>22 The High Court in Malleys Ltd v JW Tomlin Pty Limited [1961 62] 35 ALJR 352 (' Malleys ') at p 352 said:
 
 'It is, of course, true that every shape is not a design; there must be "sufficient individuality of appearance" to distinguish it from what Russell-Clarke in Ch.2 of his book Copyright in Industrial Designs aptly describes as "the fundamental form" of an article. Furthermore, the existence of that sort of individuality is to be determined by the eye and not by measuring dimensions . It follows that a design need not have the precision of a working drawing; it concerns the shape or configuration of an article, as it appears to the eye. If a design applied by another has the features that are characteristic of the registered design and are so arranged that to the eye the resulting shape is substantially the same, there is infringement, whereas if the same features are arranged so that to the eye the resulting shape is different, there is, in the absence of fraudulent imitation, no infringement.' 
 (Emphasis added.)

23 The applicant's written submissions set out the features of the Registered Design, correctly in my view. Those submissions recite:
 
 '15. The Registered Design depicts a surf mat which can be characterized as having the following individual design features or integers which, when combined, result in its distinctive appearance: 
 
 
 
 (1) [viewed in plan (as from above or below)] a crescent or swallow shaped tail or end; 
 (2) symmetrically curving towards a widest point approximately three quarters along its length; 
 (3) which then curves to a flattened top; 
 (4) from which two handles protrude; 
 (5) [viewed in profile from either end] an ovaloid shape with slightly flattened top and bottom which at each side comes to a point; 
 (6) [viewed in profile] an elliptical shape that is thicker at the front portion and which tapers to a narrower rear portion.'

24 I have inspected the inflated DMC product and compared it with the Registered Design. The inflated DMC product possesses each of the features identified in the applicant's written submissions, with the exception that the handles do not protrude from the top of the surfmat as depicted in the Registered Design. The handles on the Wavestar also do not protrude from the top of the surfmat, as depicted in the Registered Design.

27 For present purposes, being the interlocutory purposes, I am satisfied that, to the eye, the shape of the DMC product is substantially the same as that of the Registered Design. It is, in my opinion, strongly arguable that the design, which has been applied to the DMC product, is an obvious imitation of the Registered Design. That is, in the words of the test in Malleys , to be found at p 354 of the report: ''... not the same but a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences ...'</text>

<tocase>Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd and Others [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/32.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Even if I am wrong in that view, it seems that the test for fraudulent imitation is also - and even more strongly arguable. The test for fraudulent imitation requires less objective similarity between the Registered Design and the impugned product. The High Court, in Polyaire and K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 ( 'Polyaire' ) was concerned with, amongst other things, the question of fraudulent imitation. At p 301 par 32 the High Court approved the passage in Edmunds and Bentwich, ' The Law of Copyright in Designs' :
 
 'A "fraudulent imitation" is imitation with knowledge that the patent is a registered design, and without any sufficient invention on the part of the imitator.'

30 The High Court, in Polyaire, said, at p 295 par 17:
 
 '...the application of a "fraudulent imitation" requires that the application of the design be with knowledge of the existence of the registration and of the absence of consent to its use, or with reason to suspect those matters, and that the use of the design produces what is an "imitation" within the meaning of para (a) [of s 30(1) of the 1906 Act] . This, to apply the general principle recently exemplified in Macleod v The Queen [(2004) 214 CLR 242] , is the knowledge, belief or intent which renders the conduct fraudulent...'

31 I am satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case of fraudulent imitation. It seems inevitable that, if the Wavestar is an embodiment of the Registered Design, then the DMC product is a fraudulent imitation. The design of the Wavestar and the DMC product is almost identical. It could not have been independently created. It is now admitted that the DMC product is a copy of the Wavestar. That conclusion is the explanation, it seems to me, of the identical ribbing structure and the same construction materials.

32 So, also, is the embarrassing identity of the direct words of the warning label, including the imprinting of the words: 'The shape of this inflatable product is a Registered Design' .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/816.html</AustLII>
<text>29 The High Court approved the observations by Lehane J in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 816 ; (1999) 91 FCR 167 at p 200, where Lehane J said:
 
 '...the essential questions are, first, whether the allegedly infringing design is based on or derived from the registered design and, then, whether the differences are so substantial that the result is not to be described as an imitation. Frequently, of course, probably usually, changes will have been introduced for the purpose of disguising copying or, perhaps, because of a conscious desire to come as close as possible to the registered design while avoiding infringement. But, as this case illustrates, particular changes may be introduced for other compelling reasons; and there is no obvious reason why that should defeat a claim of fraudulent infringement.'</text>
