<text>26 The applicants have, in my view, established a serious question to be tried, or as that time honoured phrase has been refined more recently in the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 , a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial.

27 I then come to the question of the balance of convenience. On the one hand, the applicants assert that there is a risk if these new V-Series plates are issued following the auction that the value of their plates will significantly depreciate. The respondent does not gainsay that proposition. I note that, in the auction catalogue that I have already referred to which is concerned with the auction tomorrow night, although the other plates that constitute lots in the auction have a guiding monetary range adjacent to them, the V-Series plates do not. It is evident that VicRoads is wishing to test the water and that the valuation which might be placed on particular plates is presently a matter only of speculation and will depend on what the market will bear when the auction takes place.

28 The auction, as I've already indicated, is not confined to V-Series plates. There are 40 other lots that will be available, and there is therefore no reason why the auction cannot proceed tomorrow night. The two applicants have indicated a willingness to give undertakings as to damages, such that if the other plates, the V-Series plates, are not offered for auction tomorrow night, and damage to the respondent ensues they will be responsible for the payment of compensation. Accordingly, I think, on balance, convenience favours the granting of the injunction sought, not in the form that appears in the application, but in the form of a minute of proposed order that was handed to me this afternoon. There will simply be a restraint until trial or further order on the respondent offering the V-Series numberplates for sale.</text>
