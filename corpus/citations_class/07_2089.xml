<text>1 This is an application, under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act "), for the Court to approve a settlement of part of a representative proceeding. The details of the proceeding in which the application is made are summarised in the judgment of Gordon J in Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [2] - [4] . The settlement has been reached between certain of the applicants, acting on behalf of all group members, and the first and second respondents. It will be convenient to refer to it as "the MFL settlement". The terms of the settlement were contained in a deed dated 13 November 2007. The deed was a confidential exhibit in the proceeding.

2 By order dated 30 November 2007 (as varied by a further order which I made this morning) I ordered that:
 
 "1... 
 
 2...

3 On or before 3 December 2007 the Applicant's solicitors shall post by ordinary mail to all group members in the representative proceeding: 
 
 
 
 
 
 a a notice of proposed settlement in a form approved by the Court in respect of settlement of the representative proceeding in terms of the Deed of Settlement between the Applicant's and the first and second Respondents dated 13 November 2007 ("the Deed of Settlement"); and 
 b an opt out notice pursuant to s 33J of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act ") in a form approved by the Court; 
 
 
 
 
 3A any group member who wishes to exercise their right to opt out of this representative proceeding shall on or before 4.00 pm on 18 December 2007 file with the Court a completed opt-out notice.

7 The principles which guide the exercise of the Court's power under s 33V and the considerations which are, or may be, relevant in the exercise of the power have been identified in a series of cases. Those authorities have, conveniently, been collected by Gordon J in Haslam at [17]-[20]. I have had regard to those principles and considerations which arise in the present application in dealing with it.

8 The application is supported by an affidavit of Mr Leonard Adrian Warren, a principal of Russell Kennedy, the solicitors for the applicant. He deposed to the following relevant matters:
 
 &#8226; His communications with group members had led him to the belief that they are "broadly in favour of the proposed settlement."
 &#8226; Most of the group members had attended the mediation at which the settlement was negotiated. A broad outline of the settlement was explained to them and all of them were in favour of the settlement.
 &#8226; He had explained to each of the group members the strength and weaknesses of their legal position on various legal issues and had concluded "that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, having regard, in particular, to the possibility that a worse result may have been achieved at trial."
 &#8226; Approval of the settlement will save the group members substantial costs and anxiety associated with a trial at which they were not assured of success.

9 As is already noted the terms of the MFL settlement are confidential. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that it provides for measures by which title to their properties will be restored to group members.</text>
