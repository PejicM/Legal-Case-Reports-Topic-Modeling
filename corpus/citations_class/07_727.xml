<text>5 The second ground asserts bias. This is a serious allegation. It is without foundation. The appellant also asserts that the Tribunal did not refer to proper independent information for the consideration of the decision. There are a number of Full Court authorities confirming that the Tribunal's task is to consider whether it is satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been complied with. It will be difficult to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction if the appellant does not provide sufficient information, such as by not attending a hearing. In the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction, a visa application must be rejected (see NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 , NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73). A circumstance leading to the decision to which the Refugee Review Tribunal arrived was that the appellant did not appear at the scheduled hearing. In my decisions in SZGST v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 326 and SZIGQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 328 I have discussed the difficulties that confront an appellant in those circumstances.</text>
