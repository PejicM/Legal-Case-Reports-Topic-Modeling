<tocase>Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379</tocase>
<text>Both before and after the use of the word "speculative" the Tribunal identified for itself the correct test for a well-founded fear of persecution: Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 429. I agree with the Federal Magistrate that the Tribunal's reasons, considered as a whole, show that the Tribunal posed for itself the correct test.

The second ground of appeal, even if successful, would not mean that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error. The question of State protection did not arise in this case because the Tribunal found that the appellants' fear of persecution was not well-founded. That being the case, the question of State protection did not arise.

Even if it did, however, in my opinion, the ground has not been made out. Whilst the Tribunal found that rape remained a serious problem in South Africa, the Tribunal raised with the appellants the proposition that they would be able to receive protection from the authorities if they were to return to South Africa.

In the end result, it is not entirely clear whether the Tribunal made a decision of that kind but, in my opinion, they were not bound to do so having regard to the conclusion that the appellants' fear of persecution was not well-founded. Insofar as the Tribunal considered the question of State protection, no error has been demonstrated.

That disposes of the two grounds.</text>

<tocase>Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>The Tribunal's reasons must be read fairly and in their context: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271, 291. The Tribunal's use of the word "speculative" was not intended, on a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision, to erect a test for a claim for a well-founded fear of persecution other than that contained in the Refugees Convention. The Tribunal said that the fundamental question for it "is whether there is a real chance of Convention-related harm occurring to the applicants in the reasonably (sic) future." It then addressed the second and third appellants' fear of being raped in South Africa. It is clear that the Tribunal posed for itself the appropriate test, notwithstanding that the Tribunal answered it by saying that the claim was speculative. That is made even clearer by what the Tribunal said after making that finding. It said, "... the Tribunal is not satisfied that those factors, without more, mean that there is a real chance that they would be raped."

Other matters were referred to in the appellants' written and oral submissions. In those submissions, the appellants contended that the Tribunal should have found that the second and third appellants' claims of fear of rape were well-founded. The Tribunal found that rape was a serious problem in South Africa. However, the ultimate finding as to whether or not the second and third appellants' fears were well-founded was a matter for the Tribunal. This Court is not entitled to embark upon a merits review: Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272.

In the appellants' written submissions, the appellants suggested that the Tribunal failed to assess the second and third appellants as members of a particular social group in considering their claims of fear of rape. The Tribunal did assess their claims on the footing that they were females and beautiful young Indian women. No other particular social group was propounded by the appellants. In that regard, the Tribunal assessed their claims appropriately. In any event, the Tribunal found that their claims of fear of rape were not well-founded.

During the hearing, the appellants' counsel contended that the Tribunal had fallen into error by saying that it was "no systematic ill-treatment of Indians by 'black' South Africans". It was put to counsel that the appellants' notice of appeal did not make such a claim. Nor did the appellants' application to the Federal Magistrates Court make such a claim. The Court adjourned for a short time to enable the appellants' counsel to consider whether to apply to amend the notice of appeal to include a further ground. On resumption, the appellants' counsel said no such application would be made. Presumably, in doing so, the appellants had regard to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</text>
