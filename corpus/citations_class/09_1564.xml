<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 (2009) 259 ALR 429</tocase>

<text>As to ground 3 in the court below, the federal magistrate was correct to say that there is no general obligation on the Tribunal, to conduct its own independent investigation of the appellant's claims. That proposition is now the subject of further authority by the High Court, in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 (2009) 259 ALR 429. That authority confirms the proposition that the Tribunal did not have a general obligation to make its own independent inquiries. To the extent to which the appellant placed material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal did conduct a thorough investigation of that material. The Tribunal's reasons for decision run to 48 pages. They are detailed. The Tribunal spent a good deal of time listening to the appellant's case on the two days on which it conducted parts of its hearing. It reasoned in great detail about the difficulties it had in accepting the appellant's account of events that had occurred in relation to him in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, for the appellant, the Tribunal found that it could not accept the truth of most of that account.

As to ground 4 in the court below, the appellant has not attempted to suggest in this Court that the federal magistrate was in error in relation to the Tribunal's reliance on independent information. It would have been necessary for the appellant to isolate exactly what items of information the Tribunal regarded as a reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate, which it had failed to give particulars of, to the appellant, in accordance with s 424A. Only information that did not fall within one of the exceptions in subs (3) of that section could have been relied on.

As to ground 5 in the court below, the three reasons given by the federal magistrate for rejecting that ground were all correct.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNAV [2009] FCAFC 109</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/109.html</AustLII>
<text>The preference that the federal magistrate expressed for not following the judgment of another federal magistrate in SZNAV , has now been confirmed as correct by the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNAV [2009] FCAFC 109. In that case, the Full Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the federal magistrate who had decided SZNAV .

To the extent to which the grounds of appeal to this Court seek to raise different issues from those raised in the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant cannot succeed on those issues. Manifestly, all of his grounds and his written submissions are seeking to agitate again, matters of fact, determined by the Tribunal. I repeat that this Court does not have the power to deal with those matters of fact. The Tribunal made its findings about the fabrication of police records in Bangladesh, and the unreliability of the documents tendered by the appellant. It is not for this Court to overturn those findings. They were matters of fact for the Tribunal only. The findings certainly do not support the conclusion that the Tribunal made its decision in bad faith, or came to the case with a preset mind. The Tribunal was doing its job of evaluating the evidence relating to the appellant's claim. The fact that the Tribunal did not find in the appellant's favour about his fear of persecution because of his political affiliations or his religion is not a ground for overturning the Tribunal's decision. Again, the Tribunal's function was to evaluate whether the appellant's expressed fear of persecution for those two reasons was a well-founded fear. In each instance, the Tribunal held that the fear was not well-founded. This Court cannot overturn that conclusion on a matter of fact. There is no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to understand the nature of persecution, or the test that it was to apply in reaching that conclusion. Nor is there any evidence of denial of procedural fairness. One ground again raised the issue of the reliability of the documents from Bangladesh. The appellant claimed in his written submission that the Tribunal did not comply with s 424A of the Migration Act , by inviting him to make a written comment before it made those findings. The Tribunal was not obliged to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act in respect of any information in relation to the findings about the documents. There was no information on which the Tribunal relied, as the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate of the Minister in that respect. There was no information, therefore, of which the Tribunal could give the appellant particulars, and seek his comment about the effect of the information.

For all of these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed.</text>

<tocase>SZNAV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 693</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/693.html</AustLII>
<text>The federal magistrate then went on to consider the various provisions of the Migration Act imposing procedural requirements on the Tribunal, to determine whether there had been any failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions. In doing so, his Honour declined at [60]-[61] to follow the judgment of another federal magistrate in SZNAV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 693. His Honour concluded that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error by means of any failure to comply with any requirement of the provisions of the Migration Act .

Both in his notice of appeal to this Court and in his outline of submissions, the appellant has raised three grounds. They do not address the grounds of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court specifically. Nor do they address themselves to the reasons for judgment of the federal magistrate. The first ground is that the Tribunal made its decision in bad faith. That is justified by reference to the Tribunal's findings that the appellant fabricated the documents concerning police records in Bangladesh and that the Tribunal did not believe that the documents from Bangladesh were reliable. The second ground is that the Tribunal failed to consider persecution on the basis of the appellant's Christian religion. The third ground is that the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act and the Federal Magistrates Court failed to identify that issue. This ground is particularised as involving a lack of procedural fairness. The denial of procedural fairness is exemplified by reference to the Tribunal's findings in relation to the documents from Bangladesh.

In his oral submissions, the appellant has been keen to persuade me that the documents he tendered to the Tribunal were all genuine. He pointed to the relative ease of investigating the genuineness of those documents, particularly to the presence of telephone numbers in some of them, and to the failure of the Tribunal to conduct any such investigation. He submitted that the Tribunal came to the case with a preset mind.</text>

<tocase>SZNKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 791</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/791.html</AustLII>
<text>This appeal is from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in SZNKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 791. That judgment was delivered on 27 August 2009. The learned federal magistrate dismissed with costs an application by the appellant, seeking to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), the second respondent to this appeal, signed on 10 March 2009 and delivered on 11 March 2009. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), the first respondent in this appeal, not to grant the appellant a protection visa.

The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia on 17 July 2008. On 28 August 2008, he applied for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate refusing to grant him that visa was made on 4 November 2008. The Tribunal conducted a hearing on two days, 17 February and 4 March 2009.

By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention, as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined respectively in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967. It is convenient to call those two documents, taken together, the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 
 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country</text>
