<tocase>Metropolitan Bank Ltd v Pooley (1885) 10 App Cas 210</tocase>
<text>18 The bankrupt is not entitled, having been adjudged bankrupt, to bring proceedings against his trustee and other parties seeking to maintain a claim for, if it be his claim, as I say it is not particularised, that the trustee and those other parties maliciously procured the bankruptcy or conspired amongst themselves to cause the bankruptcy to occur: Metropolitan Bank Ltd v Pooley (1885) 10 App Cas 210. Nor, in my opinion, can the applicant do what the applicant sought to do by seeking to set aside the bankruptcy and have an order for an annulment bring proceedings at the same time against those other parties, if it be the case, for the malicious procurement of the bankruptcy or conspiracy to cause the bankruptcy: Re Coyle and Another (1993) 120 ALR 527. In my opinion, these proceedings are misconceived. The applicant is not entitled in this proceeding to seek damages against the third to ninth respondents whilst at the same time seeking to set aside the order for bankruptcy and seeking an order for an annulment. Whilst he remains a bankrupt he has no right of action of the kind that he seeks to pursue against the third to ninth respondents.</text>

<tocase>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/69.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The test is no longer the one propounded in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. The test is now whether there is any reasonable prospect of the party successfully prosecuting the proceeding.

23 In my opinion, there is no prospect at all, let alone a reasonable prospect of the applicant prosecuting the proceeding against the third to ninth respondents for the reasons already advanced. There is no reasonable prospect of the applicant prosecuting the proceedings against the second respondent, who is not the trustee of the applicant's bankrupt estate but the trustee of his wife's bankrupt estate. As I have already mentioned, his wife sought that her application for an annulment be dismissed this morning. I am also satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect that the applicant could prosecute an application for an annulment against the first respondent in the absence of any proper particulars. For all of those reasons, the proceeding is dismissed.

24 Each of the respondents has sought costs against the applicant and on an indemnity basis. In my opinion, this is one of those cases where it would be appropriate to make an order of that kind, having regard to what I have already described as the scandalous allegations in the proceeding which has been brought, and the hopelessness of the proceeding generally.</text>
