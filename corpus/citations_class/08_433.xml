<text>4 The Court's discretion under s 601AH is very wide. The factors to be taken into account in the exercise of that discretion include the circumstances in which the company was de-registered, the purpose in seeking its re-registration and the likely prejudice to any person; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at 693. In this case the purpose of the order is to allow the company to take its place alongside the other asset vendors as a respondent and cross-claimant in the proceedings. As such, its fortunes would stand or fall with the other respondents and cross-claimants. The company's ability to contribute financially to any order made against the respondents would depend on its success in the cross-claim, however there is no suggestion that its position in defending the claims made by the applicants in the main proceeding or in pursuing the cross-claim would differ from that of the other respondents and cross-claimants. At this stage there has been no submission that the company's participation would be likely to add to the costs in the proceeding.

5 The applicants on the notice of motion have tendered a letter dated 17 March 2008 from ASIC which states that ASIC does not oppose the application on the following conditions:
 
 
 1. The order sought for reinstatement is in terms of section 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act , requiring ASIC to reinstate the registration of the company; 
 2. The company (if ordered to be reinstated) continues in liquidation (subject to any order made by the Court in this regard) and a liquidator appointed; 
 3. The Court order is lodged with ASIC ... so that the company may be reinstated; 
 4. The Applicant pays ASIC's costs of $434 for consideration of this matter; 
 5. The applicant notifies ASIC upon conclusion of the winding up so that the company may be deregistered.

6 The letter from ASIC points out that if the company was re-registered it would return on ASIC's register to the status of External Administration. Clearly condition 2 above assumes that re-registration of the company would not automatically reinstate Mr Taylor as liquidator and therefore that it would be necessary to appoint a liquidator.

7 There are conflicting authorities as to whether a liquidator of a company who was in office at the time the company was de-registered is automatically reinstated to that office when the company is restored to the register. In Brownlie v TTPM Pty Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1204 , Hamilton J held that in such circumstances the liquidator was automatically reinstated and approved a statement to that effect made in A R Keay, McPherson: The Law of Company Liquidation 4 th ed, 1999 at 678; see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at 697.</text>

<tocase>Donmastry Pty Ltd v Albarran (2004) 49 ACSR 745</tocase>
<text>8 The opposite conclusion was reached by Barrett J in Ramantanis v G &amp; M Excavations [2003] NSWSC 250 ; (2004) 22 ACLC 22 and Donmastry Pty Ltd v Albarran (2004) 49 ACSR 745. In Ramantanis his Honour noted that the statement in McPherson approved by Hamilton J appeared to have been made by reference to cases under earlier and somewhat different legislation to the present. His Honour noted that the specific provision in s 601AH(5) for the automatic reinstatement as director of a person who was a director of a company immediately before it was deregistered suggests that the deemed continuity of existence of the company is not sufficient to cause a director to resume his former position upon reinstatement of the registration. By analogy his Honour concluded that it followed that re-registration per se was also not sufficient to reinstate a liquidator. His Honour observed at paras [8] - [9],:
 
 As a matter of policy, however, a pre-existing and undischarged liquidator should resume office on reinstatement of registration. Section 601AH(3)(b) empowers the court to make "any order it considers appropriate", when making an order for reinstatement. I consider that that provides a suitable means of dealing with a situation where, as here, a liquidator was in office at the time of deregistration ... 
 In view of the continuity that s 601AH(5) is intended to produce (which, in my view, entails continuity of that aspect of the company's characteristics which causes it to be in the course of winding up), the orders that the court makes should, in each case, put beyond doubt the ongoing tenure of the original liquidator. There are detailed provisions in the Act as to the resignation and replacement of liquidators. If a new liquidator is to be substituted, those provisions should be observed.

9 His Honour made orders for the reinstatement of registration and the continuation of the liquidator in office. In Donmastry Barrett J confirmed the view he had expressed in Ramantanis although, as the liquidator at the time of deregistration did not wish to continue in office and had expressly consented to another liquidator being appointed in his place, his Honour acceded to that request.</text>

<tocase>National Australia Bank Ltd v Market Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) (2001) (2001) 161 FLR 1</tocase>
<text>14 The "Caesar's wife" standard of impartiality and independence for liquidators is established beyond the need for authority, however, if support for the proposition is needed it is not necessary to go beyond Young J's comprehensive discussion of the issue in National Australia Bank Ltd v Market Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) (2001) 161 FLR 1 at 29-32. Nevertheless, as Mr Stoljar accepted, the mere fact that a proposed liquidator's relationship with the company falls within one or more of the categories listed in s 532(c) does not preclude his or her appointment as the section itself provides that the Court has discretion in the matter. When asked what was the substance of the conflict that J P Morgan fears, Mr Stoljar was not able to put the matter higher than that his client has "an apprehension" that Mr Taylor would find it difficult to reconcile his various roles in the proceedings, particularly his role as liquidator of a company, a contingent creditor of which is his client.

15 In this case the application for reinstatement of the company has been brought for the limited purpose of this litigation. Although, once reinstated, the company exists for all purposes there is no reason to suspect that there is any purpose behind the application other than that stated. It seems to me that, as matters presently stand, the reinstatement of GC &amp; Associates has the effect of preserving the respondents' position without substantive prejudice. The main proceeding here is estimated to be long and complicated and it seems unnecessary to add further expense and delay by requiring a liquidator other than Mr Taylor to be appointed because of a potential conflict that may, in substance, never eventuate. Should the proceeding result in the company being indebted to Mr Stoljar's client, any substantive prejudice can be addressed by an appropriate application to the Court at that stage. I should also note that J P Morgan may also reserve its position in relation to the matters mentioned in [10] above.

16 The applicants on the notice of motion have brought in short minutes of order providing for the re-instatement of GC &amp; Associates Pty Ltd by ASIC; the subsequent appointment of Mr Taylor as liquidator of the company and all ancillary matters including any amendment of the cross-claim, the defence to the cross-claim and any application for security for costs. I shall make orders in accordance with those short minutes.

 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.
