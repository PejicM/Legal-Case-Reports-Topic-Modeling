<text>The respondent and its lawyers have made application to the Court to be released from the implied undertaking to the Court which prevents them from making use of one particular document produced to the respondent and to its lawyers in these proceedings under the processes of the Court otherwise than for the purposes of these proceedings (as to which, see Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 ; (2008) 235 CLR 125). The respondent has informed me that it proposes to commence fresh proceedings for declaratory, injunctive and other relief against the applicants and others upon the basis that the structures which underpin the applicants' case in these proceedings constitute an unregistered management investment scheme, based upon the Full Court authority of Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd [2009] FCAFC 147. There is no opposition to the respondent being released from that implied undertaking.</text>
