<text>The decision of a judge to adjourn a hearing is not only an interlocutory decision, it is a discretionary decision ( Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 258 ALR 14 , Goldberg v Morrow [2004] FCA 1490 at [36] ). There is authority that the discretion in respect of ordering or refusing an adjournment miscarries where the refusal of an adjournment results in one of the parties being unable adequately to present his case ( Thornberry v R (1995) 69 ALJR 777). Where there is a proper basis for an application for an adjournment, and refusal would seriously prejudice the party seeking the adjournment and not prejudice the other party, there is authority that adjournment should ordinarily be granted: Jordan v Smart [1961] NSWR 735.</text>

<tocase>Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2003] FCA 1337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/1337.html</AustLII>
<text>It is clear that a power of attorney as held by Mr Kerr from Ms Kerr does not provide a lawful basis for a non-lawyer to act for a party in litigation in a Federal Court (cf Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2003] FCA 1337). However the Court has discretion to grant leave to a person who is not a qualified legal practitioner to represent a litigant. Such a person is commonly known as a "Mackenzie friend". I note that I consider it inappropriate that an application should be made by Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr without Ms Kerr being present. However I understand that in previous proceedings in this Court Mr Kerr has represented Ms Kerr in her absence. For the purposes of today's hearing, which is procedural only, I am prepared to entertain Mr Kerr's application to represent Ms Kerr.</text>

<tocase>Teese v State Bank of New South Wales [2002] NSWCA 219</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/219.html</AustLII>
<text>As pointed out by Ipp AJA in Teese v State Bank of New South Wales [2002] NSWCA 219 at [15] , the usual ground for granting leave to a person, not properly qualified, to represent a litigant is impecuniosity, namely where the litigant cannot afford to pay a properly qualified lawyer. In this case Ms Kerr's impecuniosity was the reason for seeking that Mr Kerr should speak for her in Court. In the circumstances I was prepared to grant leave to Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr for the purposes of today's proceedings.

There was no appearance in Court by either American Express or the Insolvency Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) which is Ms Kerr's trustee in bankruptcy. I understand that American Express has informed Deputy District Registrar Baldwin of the Queensland Registry of this Court that it would not appear either in respect of this notice of motion or in the appeal more generally having regard to the substantial costs already incurred by the company to date, and in light of the fact that Ms Kerr's estate has no funds.

At my request Deputy District Registrar Belcher informed the appellant prior to today's hearing that I currently hold an American Express credit card, and inquired whether, from the appellant's perspective, this gave rise to any concerns as to perceived bias on my part. I understand that my possession of this card has not caused the appellant any concern in relation to me hearing this notice of motion.</text>
