<tocase>Comcare Australia (Department of Defence) v Maida (2002) 36 AAR 69</tocase>
<text>32 In Comcare Australia (Department of Defence) v Maida (2002) 36 AAR 69, the claimant had an accepted schizophrenic condition. That was a permanent impairment that the claimant had prior to 1 December 1988. There was no entitlement to compensation by way of a lump sum for that condition under the 1971 Act. The claimant's condition worsened after 1 December 1988. The question was whether the claimant's claim under the SRC Act should be allowed. After reviewing the authorities, Mansfield J said (at [28]) that the following was a correct summary of the state of the law:
 
 
 '1. The progression of a disease or gradual worsening of the degree of an impairment does not constitute a new or distinct impairment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. If there is no change in the underlying patho-physiological condition causing an impairment, any worsening of that impairment will not constitute a new or distinct impairment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. A significant worsening of an impairment may constitute a new or distinct impairment, but only if there has been a change in the underlying path-physiological condition, so that there has been a qualitative change to the impairment that is, the development of a new impairment.'

33 On the evidence in this case, the deterioration in the applicant's hearing loss was an effect of ageing and that means that it was not a new or further impairment in the relevant sense. The applicant has already received compensation of a lump sum in respect of his hearing loss under the 1971 Act. Any claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to a deterioration of that condition of the nature indicated is precluded by s 124(3)(a) of the SRC Act.

34 As I have said, there is no evidence of a deterioration of the applicant's tinnitus, but even if it has deteriorated, there is nothing to suggest that that deterioration is other than a progression or gradual worsening of the condition. Tinnitus was not a compensable condition under the 1930 Act or the 1971 Act. Any claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to that condition or a deterioration of that condition of the nature indicated is precluded by s 124(3)(b) of the SRC Act.

35 The claim in relation to the conditions of loss of balance and stress were not the subject of any debate before the Tribunal. The applicant's case is that those conditions were permanent impairments that occurred in 1970. The applicant's claim for compensation of a lump sum in relation to those conditions in these proceedings cannot succeed for a number of reasons.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439</tocase>
<text>38 Finally, although there are related conditions or effects under the SRC Act (eg, vertigo), loss of balance and stress are not of themselves conditions compensable under the approved guide prepared under s 28 of the SRC Act (see also Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439).

39 In my opinion, the proposed appeal is futile and doomed to fail and, in those circumstances, the application for an extension of time within which to appeal should be dismissed.

40 The application for an extension of time within which to appeal is dismissed.

<tocase>Department of Defence as Delegate of Comcare v West (1998) 156 ALR 651</tocase>
<text>31 In Department of Defence as Delegate of Comcare v West (1998) 156 ALR 651, the question was whether a deterioration in the claimant's lumbar spine and an impairment in both legs were new impairments for the purpose of a claim for compensation under the SRC Act. Merkel J (with whom O'Connor J agreed) stated the relevant principles in the following passages from his reasons for judgment (at 668 and 669):
 
 'The present state of the authorities can be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 &#8226; the gradual worsening of a permanent impairment in accordance with its natural progress does not constitute a series of new impairments each giving rise to a separate liability to pay compensation: see Blackman at 14 and Brennan at FCR 570 1 per Gummow J; cf Brennan at FCR 558 9 per Burchett J; 
 
 &#8226; the observation in Blackman at 14 that a permanent impairment which worsens significantly or is such that the variation between it and the earlier permanent impairment is substantial does not result in a new permanent impairment is to be approached with "some caution": see Brennan at FCR 558 9 and 560 1 per Burchett J and at 571 per Gummow J and Levett at FCR 20. 
 
 
 The present case requires resolution of the question left unresolved in the current state of the authorities, that is, whether a deterioration in a permanent impairment which existed as at 1 December 1988 is capable of constituting a new permanent impairment. 
 
 The caution expressed in relation to Blackman by Burchett and Gummow JJ in Brennan and adopted by the Full Court in Levett suggests a reluctance to accept that a substantial variation, or a significant deterioration, in a person's permanent impairment is incapable of constituting a permanent impairment which is different to that which existed prior to the variation or deterioration. 

 ...
 
 A loss of the entitlement conferred under ss 24 and 25 by reason of s 124(3) only occurs when the permanent impairment the subject of the claim is the permanent impairment that the employee suffered as at 1 December 1988. On my reasoning, and that of Burchett J in Brennan , where a change in a permanent impairment occurring after the commencement date is such that, quantitatively and qualitatively, it is properly to be characterised as a further or new impairment occurring after the commencing date it is compensable by a lump sum payment under ss 24 and 25. That conclusion is consistent with the language used and with the statutory policy to be discerned from ss 24, 25 and 124 of providing benefits to workers in respect of a further permanent impairment that occurs after the commencing day irrespective of whether the injury that resulted in the impairment occurred before or after the commencing day. It also avoids capricious and arbitrary outcomes under workers' compensation legislation, which is of a remedial nature and should be construed liberally: see Brennan at FCR 559 and the cases there referred to.'</text>

<tocase>Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84</tocase>
<text>36 First, it was the claim for loss of hearing which was the subject of the reconsideration under s 62 of the SRC Act. In those circumstances, it seems that a claim in relation to loss of balance and stress could not have been considered by the Tribunal: Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84.

37 Secondly, the applicant's case is that the conditions of loss of balance and stress were permanent impairments which occurred in 1970. Those conditions were not impairments for which there was an entitlement to compensation of a lump sum under the 1930 Act or the 1971 Act. Accordingly, there was no entitlement to receive compensation of a lump sum in relation to them under the SRC Act: s 124(3)(b) of the SRC Act.</text>
