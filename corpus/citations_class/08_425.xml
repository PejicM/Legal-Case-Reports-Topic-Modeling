<tocase>Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216</tocase>

<text>16 Under s 719(2) of the Act , and s 178(2) of the Act as it stood prior to 27 March 2006, where multiple breaches of an award provision arose out of a course of conduct by one person, those breaches, for the purposes of the section, constitute one breach. In Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 at 223, Gray J held that each separate obligation found in an award should be regarded as a term for the purposes of s 178. The same would now apply to s 719. Gray J went on to say at 233:
 
 The ascertainment of what is a term should not depend on matters of form, such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award, but on matters of substance, namely the different obligations which can be spelt out.

17 His Honour then said that he considered each separate obligation imposed by an award to be a "term" for the purposes of s 178. Importantly, he then said at 233:
 
 If the different terms impose cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap, it is possible to take into account the substance of the matter by imposing no penalty, or a nominal penalty, in respect of breaches of some terms, but a substantial penalty in respect of others.

18 I agree, with respect, with the approach of Gray J to the question of "course of conduct" under s 719(2) and the former s 178(2). Tracey J applied the same approach in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] 166 IR 14 at 17. I therefore reject the submission of counsel for Mrs Healey, Mr Green, that there was one single course of conduct which was constituted by Mrs Healey paying a flat rate of pay to her employees instead of the award rate plus loadings and allowances.

22 In accordance with the approach of Gray J in Gibbs , I consider it appropriate to examine the circumstances of each relevant employee and assess an appropriate penalty for each breach. This may mean that in many instances no penalty will be imposed for breaches.

23 Apart from Mr Whitton and Ms Jodi Buck, Mrs Healey employed the affected employees on a flat casual rate in breach of the award. In each of those 39 cases the critical offending conduct was the setting of a rate below the award rate. The failure to pay appropriate loadings and allowances flowed from the setting of the incorrect rates of pay for the relevant classifications. The 50% figure referred to above should apply to the maximum penalty available for all breaches of cl 18 of the award which is applicable, as at their commencement date, to all but seven employees. Those seven commenced as juniors. Clause 15.5.2 was breached in respect of them. In other words, depending on the time of commencement of the employee a fine of 50% of the maximum should be imposed 41 times. In seven of those cases the relevant breach will be that of cl 15.5.1 because seven of the 41 employees commenced as junior employees.

29 The total penalties for breaches of cls 15.5.1 (in respect of juniors) and 18 (in respect of adults) amount to $91,300. Putting to one side the non-payment of Ms Jodi Buck, the major transgression was the setting of a flat rate for all purposes for every employee, except Mr Whitton. Even Mr Whitton was not paid the amount due under the award. Accordingly, seven penalties will be imposed for breach of cl 15.5.2 and 34 for breach of cl 18. The failure to pay the correct casual loadings and allowances in breach of cl 15.2.2 involved Mrs Healey in a failure to comply with obligations which "substantially overlap" (in the words of Gray J in Gibbs at 233) with the obligation to set the appropriate adult or junior rate for the relevant classification as required by cls 15.5.1 and 18. Consequently, I impose no penalty for breaches of cl 15.5.2 of the award. I also impose no penalties for additional breaches of cls 15.5.1 and 18 in respect of payments made to employees in the weeks subsequent to the commencement.</text>

<tocase>Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) 166 IR 14</tocase>
<text>18 I agree, with respect, with the approach of Gray J to the question of "course of conduct" under s 719(2) and the former s 178(2). Tracey J applied the same approach in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] 166 IR 14 at 17. I therefore reject the submission of counsel for Mrs Healey, Mr Green, that there was one single course of conduct which was constituted by Mrs Healey paying a flat rate of pay to her employees instead of the award rate plus loadings and allowances.

24 As set out by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick at 16-17, prior to 10 August 2004, the maximum penalty for breach of s 178 was $2,200 for an individual. Since that time it has been $6,600 for breach of s 178 and, on and after 27 March 2006, s 719.

25 The following 20 former employees of Mrs Healey commenced employment with her prior to 10 August 2004:
 
&#8226; Hannah Bereznicki (junior on commencement)
 
&#8226; Luke Buck
 
&#8226; Sandra Buck
 
&#8226; John de Little
 
&#8226; Rebecca Denton
 
&#8226; George Friend
 
&#8226; Tom Friend (junior on commencement)
 
&#8226; Meika Gale
 
&#8226; Skye Gargan
 
&#8226; Iain Hickman
 
&#8226; Felipa Jarzynka
 
&#8226; Catherine Keygan
 
&#8226; Glen Logan
 
&#8226; Fiona McKenzie
 
&#8226; Chani Rigby (junior on commencement)
 
&#8226; Stephanie Semmens
 
&#8226; Luke Sorrentino
 
&#8226; James Stoessiger
 
&#8226; Drew Underwood, and 
 
&#8226; Sian Williams (junior on commencement).

26 The balance commenced after 10 August 2004. Three of them commenced as juniors. They were:
 
&#8226; Jennifer Dalwood;
 
&#8226; Tegan Gale, and
 
&#8226; Jessica Hodgson.</text>

<tocase>Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/8.html</AustLII>
<text>30 Having determined an appropriate level of penalty for each of the contraventions of the award, I must now look at the aggregate of those penalties ($91,300) to form a view whether that figure is out of proportion to the overall conduct of Mrs Healey; see Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 at [23] per Gray J. This exercise may also be described as did Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [71] as ensuring that the figure provides an appropriate response to the conduct which led to their breaches.

31 
 
The application of the totality principle does not mean that the figure arrived at before its consideration must be reduced. However, the Court must engage in what Gray J described in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [27] as an "instinctive synthesis" and arrive at a figure which Graham J said at [73] should be "just and appropriate".

32 The conduct which led to the breaches occurred over seven years. The only evidence before the Court to explain it is found in the agreed statement of facts at paragraphs 8 and 9 where reference is made to OWS receiving a complaint from Ms Tracey Pearce. At paragraph 9 the following is said:
 
 In her claim to OWS, Ms Pearce stated that during the course of her employment at the Theatre Royal Hotel, she was paid pursuant to wage rates contained in a purported AWA, and as a consequence believed that she had not been paid her correct rate of pay .

33 It is open to be inferred that, at least in the case of Ms Pearce, Mrs Healey attempted to apply an AWA which was inoperative for some reason relating to lack of compliance with legislative provisions concerning AWAs. There is no other evidence with respect to AWAs in which Mrs Healey is the employer. Even if the rates set were struck in accordance with incomplete AWAs, there is no evidence that any employee agreed to their terms. In any event, this does not explain other strange features of this matter such as the non-payment of Ms Jodi Buck, the downward adjustments in the rate applicable to Ms Hodgson and the attempt to give some loading to the rate of Mr Whitton but to no-one else.</text>
