<text>1 This is an application for an extension to time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate: MZXPH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1620 , delivered on 12 October 2007. The Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 22 January 2007. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa.

2 The applicant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of membership of a particular social group and actual or imputed political opinion. He claimed to fear persecution from one Anuradda Ratwatte, the Defence Adviser to the Sri Lankan president. He claimed his grandfather, who was a police officer, had allegedly been threatened by Ratwatte during Sri Lankan elections and later murdered. He claimed his father, a former assistant superintendent of police, had previously arrested a number of members of the SLFP, Ratwatte's party. His father had been imprisoned on false charges but later acquitted on appeal. Since 1995 when Ratwatte's party gained power the appellant and his family have been harassed and threatened by Ratwatte's henchmen.

3 The applicant also claimed that fresh warrants for murder had been issued against his father, who now lives overseas, and that if he returned to Sri Lanka he would be detained until his father handed himself in. The applicant further claimed that he feared persecution because he was a United National Party supporter and former employee, and shared a close relationship with a number of UNP politicians.</text>
