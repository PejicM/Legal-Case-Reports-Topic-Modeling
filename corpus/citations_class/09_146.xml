<text>The Tribunal also sought comment from the Appellant in the letter in respect of particular subjects arising from his evidence as given at the first hearing which might, so the Tribunal stated in its letter, form part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. Having regard to the exclusions from the obligation which falls on the Tribunal under s 424A of the Act, which are found in s 424A(3) , and the remarks given in the High Court's judgment in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at para 17 and para 18, it may very well be the case that the Tribunal, in the despatch of this letter, exceeded what the Act strictly required of it. That is hardly a basis of criticism in respect of the proceedings in the Tribunal. See SZGIY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 68 at para 30.</text>
