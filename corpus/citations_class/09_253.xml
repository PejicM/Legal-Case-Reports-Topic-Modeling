<tocase>National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>The power available to the Court under s 48 is unfettered. Relevant factors for consideration include the residence of parties and of witnesses, expense to parties, the place where the cause of action arose and the convenience of the Court. The balance of convenience will generally be a relevant consideration, but not necessarily determinative of each case. The Court must, however, be satisfied, after considering all relevant matters, that there is sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere: National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155.

Mr Garrett recently moved to Western Australia in order to gain employment. Apart from the fact that Mr Garrett now resides in Western Australia there is no connection between this proceeding and Western Australia. However, the issues arising in this proceeding have a significant connection with South Australia as set out in the affidavit of Mr Macks sworn on 15 December 2008 in support of this application. They are in summary as follows: 
(a) Mr Macks was appointed trustee of Mr Garrett's bankrupt estate in South Australia on 27 September 2004 pursuant to s 156A(3) of the Act. 
 
(b) Mr Macks has administered the Estate from his offices in Adelaide, where all of the books and records relevant to the administration are located. These comprise some 33 archive boxes and about 20-30 arch lever files. 
 
(c) Mr Garrett's business and personal affairs that have been the subject of Mr Macks' investigations took place primarily in South Australia. 
 
(d) All of the debts the subject of the proofs of debt, which Mr Garrett seeks to challenge, arose in South Australia.
 
(e) The decisions of Mr Macks which Mr Garrett seeks to review, being the principal subject matter of this proceeding, were made by Mr Macks in Adelaide. 
 
(f) The National Australia Bank affidavits which Mr Garrett seeks to challenge were sworn in Adelaide and the deponent resides there.

There are additional considerations. Mr Macks and Mr Garrett are involved, as opponents, in two separate but related proceedings in the South Australian District Registry of this Court. Following the trial in respect of the first action, SAD29 of 2005, judgment was reserved on 7 March 2006 by Lander J. Judgment remains reserved in that matter pending determination of the second action, SAD5 of 2006 (the SA Proceedings). The trial of the SA Proceedings is listed before Lander J for four days to commence on 10 March 2009. The cross-claim filed by Mr Macks in the SA Proceedings seeks a declaration from the Court as to his entitlement to an equitable charge over assets of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust constituted by Deed of Trust dated 31 May 1993 to secure a right of indemnity in respect of liabilities of Mr Garrett. These are the same liabilities for which proofs of debt have been lodged and admitted in Mr Garrett's bankruptcy, and which, subject to the correction of the stated amount of two of those debts, are the subject of the relief sought in this proceeding by Mr Garrett.</text>
