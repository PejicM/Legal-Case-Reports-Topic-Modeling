<text>9 The " making of an application within the prescribed time is an essential preliminary to the exercise of the RRT's function ": Fernando v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 324 at [31] , [2000] FCA 324 ; 97 FCR 407 at 415 per Heerey J. Justice Finkelstein at [48] referred to the " need for the expeditious determination of the validity of an administrative decision " and continued:
 [49] It is also important to note that when Parliament conferred upon a non-citizen the right to apply to the Tribunal for the review of an RRT-reviewable decision, it also circumscribed that right by requiring it to be exercised within a stipulated period: see s31 of the Migration Reform Act 1992 (Cth) inserting into the Migration Act s166B permitting review and s166BA limiting the time for that review. This suggests that the right to review will cease to exist after the prescribed period has elapsed: compare Maxwell v Murphy (1957) 96 CLR 261 at 269 per Dixon CJ. [50] Then there is the language of s412 itself. An application for review "must" be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period. If one adopts, as it is sometimes necessary to do, the maxim that Parliament says what it means and means what is says, the language adopted by the legislature strongly suggests that an application given to the Tribunal after the relevant period has elapsed is invalid. [51] The consequences of a contrary construction must also be taken into account. If an application can be made to the Tribunal after the prescribed period has elapsed then it can be made at any time thereafter. That is to say, if an application made beyond the prescribed period is a valid application, it will be valid if given one day or one year after that period. This result could not have been intended. [52] The appellant seeks to avoid this problem by arguing that the Tribunal has discretion whether or not to consider a late application. The argument is without foundation. The Tribunal has the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Migration Act . If it is given a valid application for review it must determine that application according to its merits. The Tribunal has no power to refuse to consider a valid application. I leave out of account the question whether the Tribunal has power to strike out an application which is brought in abuse of process. It is not necessary to determine, on this appeal, whether an administrative tribunal has such a power. 
Dowsett J agreed: [2000] FCA 324 at [55] . The decision of the Full Court has since been repeatedly followed: VAQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 170 at [6] per Sundberg, Marshall and Weinberg JJ; MZNAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1126 ; VOAM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 396 at [10] per French J.</text>

<text>10 There is no power to " override " the time limitation prescribed by s 412(1)(b): VEAN of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 311 at [32] [33] per Gray, Whitlam and Mansfield JJ, [2003] FCAFC 311 ; 133 FCR 570. Their Honours there said that there was no analogy to the obligation to provide procedural fairness. The issue was not the procedural obligations imposed upon the Tribunal in performing its review function, but whether the Tribunal had power to entertain the application for review lodged out of time.

<text>4 The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the decision of the Tribunal: SZJMY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 105.

5 The Appellants now appeal to this Court. Their Grounds of Appeal contend that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error and that the Federal Magistrate erred in not so concluding. The Appellants appeared before this Court unrepresented, albeit with the benefit of an interpreter.

6 It is considered that the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in concluding that the non-compliance with the time limits within which an application must be made to the Tribunal deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The appeal, accordingly, must be dismissed.</text>
