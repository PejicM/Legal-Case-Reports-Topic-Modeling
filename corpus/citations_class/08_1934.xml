<tocase>Kennedy v Queensland (2002) 190 ALR 707</tocase>
<text>7 I am satisfied that I have power to make the orders. Although I do not have a formal minute of consent, the provisions of s 86G(2) sufficiently cover an application made co-operatively as is done in the present case. If authority is needed for this proposition, it may be found in the decision of Sackville J in Kennedy v Queensland (2002) 190 ALR 707 at 24-26.

8 I will make orders in terms of the short minutes provided by the parties. The Minister has agreed to pay the Applicant's costs of the application and I will therefore make an order in those terms. 

 I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.
