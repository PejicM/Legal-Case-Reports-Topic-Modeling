<tocase>Mok v Minister for Immigration (No 2) (1993) 47 FCR 81</tocase>
<text>6 Martech submitted that the discretion to award costs is guided by the principle that, absent some special circumstance, a successful litigant is entitled to its costs. It acknowledged that where a litigant has succeeded on some issues but failed on others, an apportionment may be appropriate. That is a matter for discretion for the trial judge. It was submitted that the Court's power to order a successful applicant to pay the costs of an issue on which it has failed ought to be exercised only where the Court, on a consideration of all the circumstances, has concluded that the raising of that issue by the applicant was so unreasonable that it is fair and just to make the order. Reliance was placed upon Mok v Minister for Immigration (No 2) (1993) 47 FCR 81 at 84D.

7 Martech submitted that while the pleadings in its claim raised a number of causes of action there were two broad issues pursued by it. These were: 
1. The forbearance affecting the level of remuneration. 
2. The termination payment. 

Martech submitted that it was wholly successful in relation to the forbearance but acknowledged that it was unsuccessful in relation to the termination payment. The latter claim failed essentially on the proper construction of cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement. Energy put in issue whether the consultancy agreement was terminated on 29 September 2000 and a significant amount of evidence was directed to that point. On that point, Martech succeeded. The forbearance issue was also one to which significant evidence was directed. There were other issues of fact on which Martech did not succeed. Martech submitted that it should have one third of its costs. It also pointed out that the first cross-claim was discontinued by leave on 20 September 2005 with costs reserved and that there was no reason why the respondent should not pay its costs of the first cross-claim.</text>

<tocase>Namol Pty Ltd v AW Baulderston Pty Ltd (1993) 119 ALR 187</tocase>
<text>8 On the matter of interest on the judgment sum, Martech submitted that interest was usually ordered for the period between the cause of action arising and judgment. It correctly pointed out that the usual practice is to award interest at the rate applied in the Supreme Court of the State where the court is sitting unless there is evidence that those rates are penal and not commercial: Namol Pty Ltd v AW Baulderston Pty Ltd (1993) 119 ALR 187; GEC Marconi Assistance Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd (2003) 201 ALR 55. Martech submitted that the cause of action arose in respect of the judgment sum on 10 December 2001 when Mr Brand first wrote to Energy advising that Martech's forbearance had ceased. Alternatively it was put that interest should run from 6 November 2003 when a further demand was made by Martech and, alternatively, 24 March 2004 when the application was commenced. A calculation of the judgment sum with interest applied from those three dates was appended to the submission.</text>

<tocase>New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulbourn Co-operative Co Ltd (1989) 14 IPR 75</tocase>
<text>9 Energy submitted in response that Martech was unsuccessful in seven of the eight causes of action and claims. It did not obtain the principal commercial objective of the proceedings, which was the termination payment in excess of $800,000. It referred to New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulbourn Co-operative Co Ltd (1989) 14 IPR 75 at 79.

10 Energy argued that the claim for unpaid fees was a distinct and separate cause of action for an amount well within the jurisdiction of the District Court of Western Australia. Had the claim been brought separately it may well have been settled commercially between the parties. It submitted that the costs should follow the event and the respondent should be entitled to the costs of the proceedings. In the alternative Martech should be ordered to pay costs in respect of the unsuccessful aspects of its case. An appropriate apportionment would be that Martech pay 90% of Energy's costs of the action.

11 Energy argued that the claim for unpaid fees occupied a relatively small amount of time at trial, both in terms of evidence and submissions. Martech adopted a "shotgun" approach to its claims for a termination payment, none of which succeeded. The claim based on implied terms required the Court to consider extensive evidence including expert evidence about allegations of non-disclosure and breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). These proved to be false issues as Martech did not establish the implied terms. In addition it did not succeed in establishing the claim for unpaid fees as pleaded. The Court held that Martech was entitled to the unpaid fees as there was no consideration for the variation pleaded by Energy. The issue of lack of consideration or uncertainty was not pleaded in reply, nor was it put in closing submissions.</text>

<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (12001) [2001] FCA 1865 ; 115 FCR 229</tocase>

<text>14 The "jurisdiction" conferred upon the Court by s 43 is in truth a power in aid of jurisdiction. It is not confined by any presumption about the manner of its exercise. Nevertheless, within the discretion of the courts to award costs in Australia, it has long been accepted that: 
 
 . ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order; 
 . where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed; 
 . a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties' costs of them. In this sense "issue" does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or law.
