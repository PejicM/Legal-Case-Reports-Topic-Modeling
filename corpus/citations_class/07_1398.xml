<tocase>Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust [1999] FCA 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/162.html</AustLII>
<text>9 Whilst Order 15A makes no provision as to the means whereby discovery should be given by a party such as the Minister to a party such as Telstra, it seems clear to me that discovery must be given in the manner for which Order 15 rule 2(2) provides, namely:
 
 
 '2(2) Unless the Court or a Judge orders otherwise, a party must give discovery by serving: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a list of documents required to be disclosed; and 
 
 (b) an affidavit verifying the list.' 
 
 


Mansfield J expressed the same view in Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust [1999] FCA 162 at [2] .

10 The form of the list of documents may, in my opinion, be taken to have been regulated by Order 15 rule 6, which relevantly provides:
 
 
 '6(1) A list of documents required by or under this Order shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be in accordance with Form 22 and conform to the requirements of this rule. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents which are ... in the possession ... of the party making the list. 
 
 (3) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents in a convenient sequence and as shortly as possible, but shall describe each document or, in the case of a group of documents of the same nature, shall describe the group, sufficiently to enable the document or group to be identified. 
 ... 
 
 (8) Where a party making a list of documents has a solicitor in the proceeding, the solicitor shall certify on the list that, according to his instructions, the list and the statements in the list are correct.'

11 Form 22, of course, provides for documents to be enumerated one by one in either Schedule 1 Part 1, Schedule 1 Part 2 or Schedule 2 of the relevant list. The operative words in Form 22 are:
 
 
 '1. The party has in his possession ... the documents enumerated in Schedule 1. 
 
 2. The documents enumerated in Part 2 of Schedule 1 are privileged from production on the ground ...

<tocase>Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/115.html</AustLII>
<text>23 In Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 ('Tyco') Hill J said at [44] [46]:
 
 '44 While there is nothing in the procedural requirements of O 15A, r 9 that deal with the filing by a respondent to an application for pre-action discovery of affidavit evidence in opposition, it has never been suggested that such affidavits could not be filed. One example where affidavits were filed was Conrock Ltd v CSR Ltd (1990) 96 ALR 690. In that case, Pincus J finally made no order for costs against the respondent, notwithstanding that the applicant was successful. The affidavits went to the question of confidentiality of documents as well as a claim that compliance with the pre-action discovery would be oppressive and onerous. In Legent Corp v Fundi Software Services Pty Ltd (unreported, Federal Court, Lockhart J, No G134 of 1992, 13 July 1992), affidavit evidence was filed by both the applicant and respondent and cross-examination was foreshadowed. However, the matter settled. Justice Lockhart observed (at 7) that the parties could not necessarily assume that they would have a right to cross-examine. His Honour cites no authority for this proposition. Perhaps what his Honour meant was that the Court would control, in its discretion, the extent of cross-examination, having regard to the issue between the parties. One can only speculate. 
 
 45 It would seem, also, that notices to produce have been issued in other pre-action discovery proceedings. It seems that Gummow J in Aitken v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 418 allowed the issue of a notice to produce and that it was answered. Likewise, it would seem that a notice to produce was issued in Legent and in CGU [ CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corp Berhad [2001] FCA 681] . It is not clear from the report of Aitken or Legent that any argument was directed at the question whether a notice to produce could issue and in those circumstances it is difficult to treat these cases as authority for the view that there is power to issue a notice. On the other hand, it is perhaps not irrelevant that it is only since CCA Beverages [ CCA Beverages (Adelaide) Ltd v Hansford (unreported Federal Court, S G58 of 1991, O'Loughlin J, 15 November 1991)] that there was thought to be a difficulty with that power. 
 
 46 However, for the reasons I have given, I am of the view that there is power to issue, in an appropriate case, a notice to produce in pre-action discovery proceedings. Whether the notice should be confined clearly depends upon the issues that are said to arise and in respect of which the production of documents is sought. An applicant who seeks to use a notice to produce, in effect, to gain production of the very documents which are the subject of the pre-action discovery will not have given the notice to produce in good faith, but rather, will have acted in a way that is an abuse of process. Otherwise, in principle at least, the notice to produce procedure may be exercised by both parties if otherwise relevant to issues in dispute. However, I would emphasise that it clearly is not contemplated that a pre-action discovery proceeding become a full-blown factual contest between the parties. The judge hearing the application will, no doubt, confine cross-examination and examine the subject matter of any notice to produce to ensure this does not become the case.'

24 Hely J recorded his general agreement with Hill J's reasons. At [54] his Honour said:
 
 'Contestable issues of fact may arise in proceedings under O 15A for preliminary discovery: St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147. There is no reason why the ordinary interlocutory procedures should not be available to assist in the resolution of those contestable issues of fact, subject to the overriding consideration that the invocation of those procedures does not amount to an abuse of the process of the Court: Kimberley Mineral Holdings Ltd (in liq) v McEwan [1980] 1 NSWLR 210. Thus, at least prima facie, it would be an abuse of process for an applicant for preliminary discovery to seek to compel the production of documents by notice to produce, when the production of those documents is sought under O 15A, r 6. But it does not follow, for example, that a subpoena sought to be issued by an applicant for preliminary discovery against a third party would necessarily be an abuse, depending upon the scope and purpose of the subpoena.'

25 It may be seen from what has been said above that the Minister's Notice to Produce served on Telstra could hardly amount to an abuse of process in the sense indicated in the passages from Tyco quoted above. A potential abuse of process might have arisen were Telstra to have issued a Notice to Produce to the Minister requiring the production of the very documents which a discovery order may identify.

26 Telstra's objection to the Minister's Notice to Produce urged that 'none of the documents sought in the Notice are relevant to the issues in the present proceeding'.

27 The Minister's original Notice to Produce dated 10 August 2007 called for the production of documents covered by 16 separate paragraphs. By a Notice of Motion filed 14 August 2007 Telstra sought an order that the initial Notice to Produce dated 10 August 2007 be set aside.</text>

<tocase>Alphapharm Pty Limited v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited [1996] FCA 391</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1996/391.html</AustLII>
<text>40 In support of its proposed redefinition of paragraphs 9 10 in the Minister's third Notice to Produce dated 22 August 2007, Telstra relied upon the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Limited v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited [1996] FCA 391 ('Alphapharm').

41 Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited apparently wrote a letter dated 16 April 1996 to pharmacists throughout Australia in relation to Alphapharm Pty Limited's anti-depressant drug 'Zactin' and Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited's competing anti-depressant drug 'Prozac', which had been on the market for a much longer time than Zactin. Alphapharm Pty Limited complained to Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited about the letter. Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited's solicitors responded to the effect that their client had in its possession material which fully supported the allegations. This led Alphapharm Pty Limited to apply for an order pursuant to Order 15A rule 6 of the Rules for discovery by Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited of such material so that Alphapharm Pty Limited would be able to decide whether to commence a proceeding in the Court against Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited alleging that the letter was misleading or deceptive in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).

42 In his reasons for judgment Lindgren J made certain observations concerning Order 15A rule 6 as follows:
 
 
 '1. Paragraphs 6 (a) and 6 (c) pose an objective test, the opening words "there is" in each paragraph signifying "there exists"; but the "insufficiency test" of para 6 (b) has both subjective and objective aspects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. Although I need not explore the subjective aspect fully, it seems clear that if the evidence went so far as to show that a particular applicant was already able to decide to commence a proceeding by, for example, showing that the applicant had in fact decided to do so, para 6 (b) would not be satisfied even though the information available did not satisfy the objective aspect of the insufficiency test referred to below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The fact that a particular applicant genuinely feels unable, because of a lack of information, to decide to commence a proceeding does not, without more, satisfy para 6 (b); the objective aspect of the paragraph requires it to be shown as an objective fact that the applicant lacks "sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding". 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. In my view, the objective aspect of para 6 (b) invokes a notion of "reasonable sufficiency", the question raised being whether it is reasonable that the applicant for an order be required to take its decision without having the information to become available from inspection of the document or documents of which discovery is sought. 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. If the insufficiency test is satisfied, a second question will arise, namely, whether the Court's discretion should be exercised in favour of the making of an order. 
 
 
 
 
 
 6. The questions posed by rule 6 and referred to above are to be answered in the context of an adversary system of forensic contest in which a proposed respondent is ordinarily entitled to withhold its evidence, certainly prior to the commencement of proceedings. 
 
 7. The questions are also to be answered in the light of the nature of the "cause of action" contemplated and the range of information potentially available in respect of a cause of action of that kind. 
 
 
 
 
 
 8. Contrary to a submission of Eli Lilly, in my opinion rule 6 is not necessarily rendered unavailable by the fact that the applicant already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief. This is made clear by the reference in para (a) to the existence of "reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has ... the right to obtain relief ..." (emphasis supplied). It would impose an artificial constraint on rule 6 , not supported by its terms or purpose, to exclude, a priori , all cases in which the insufficiency of the information possessed by the applicant to enable a decision to be made whether to litigate is due to a matter of "defence" which would defeat the prima facie case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. Rule 6 does not provide a means by which an applicant will be enabled to have available to it every document which would assist it in deciding whether to litigate. If that were the intention, paras (a) and (c) would stand alone and the additional condition set out in para (b) would not be necessary. 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. Paragraph 6 (b) contemplates that after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has come up against a problem, namely, that it is lacking a piece of information or pieces of information reasonably necessary to enable it to decide whether to commence a proceeding.'

43 As I understood Telstra's submission, it contended that production of a document could be required if it showed that a decision had in fact been made by it to commence a proceeding against the Minister or the Commonwealth to obtain relief in the Court. It asserted that production could not be required of documents recording or referring to consideration by Telstra as to whether it should commence a legal challenge or legal proceedings, but it acknowledged that documents recording or referring to its ability to decide whether to commence such a challenge or proceedings would properly be amenable to a Notice to Produce calling for their production.

44 It seems to me that an assertion that a subpoena and/or a notice to produce should be set aside if it calls for the production of documents which do not answer the description of being 'relevant', involves a misconception as to what the proper function of a subpoena and/or notice to produce is.

57 Given the terms of Mr Smith's affidavit sworn 2 August 2007, upon which Telstra intends to rely on the hearing of its Amended Application under Order 15A rule 6 , I consider the documents identified in the said paragraphs to have sufficient apparent relevance to be amenable to a notice to produce at this stage. Senior counsel for Telstra was at pains to explain that much of what was contained in Mr Smith's affidavit was there simply to provide background and had only tangential relevance. This cri de coeur does not mean that the Minister may not challenge the factual background which is relevant to those issues which need to be addressed objectively and/or subjectively on the hearing of the Order 15A rule 6 application and to which Lindgren J made reference in Alphapharm .

58 As to the scope of the requirement imposed by the said paragraphs, it is appropriate to observe that the Minister's third Notice to Produce dated 22 August 2007 is significantly scaled down from the requirement sought to be imposed by the Minister's second Notice to Produce dated 17 August 2007. Plainly, the Minister has had regard to much of the material to which Mr Healy deposed in his affidavit sworn 20 August 2007 in narrowing down her requirement. In his affidavit sworn 20 August 2007 Mr Healy said, inter alia:
 
 
 '2 I am informed by Paul Smith, Business Development Manager employed by Telstra, and believe that: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) having regard to the 12 categories of documents of which production is sought, in order to comply with the Notice, Telstra would be required to review a very large number of documents in Telstra's possession that refer or relate to the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program ( Program ) to determine which of those documents fall within the terms of the Notice. The following facts are relevant: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Mr Smith has in his email mailbox approximately 2,200 emails, 1 to 2 boxes of hard copy documents and 200 electronic documents all of which relate to the Program; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) there were approximately 10 other Telstra employees who formed the core team responsible for developing Telstra's proposal in relation to the Program; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) there were approximately 60 other Telstra employees who had input into Telstra's proposal (not including members of the Telstra Executive Team who are considered below); 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) The Telstra employees who had input into Telstra's proposal were located in offices in at least Sydney (4 buildings), Brisbane (2 buildings), Melbourne (3 buildings), Adelaide (1 building), Perth (1 building), Canberra (1 building) and Darwin (1 building); and 
 
 (v) a number of the Telstra employees who had input into Telstra's proposal no longer work for Telstra; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) in order to comply with category 1 of the Notice, Telstra would be required to review at least all documents in Telstra's possession held by: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the 4 Telstra employees who attended the Industry Briefing; 
 
 (ii) the at least 13 additional Telstra employees who Mr Smith informed of the Industry Briefing; 
 
 (iii) any other Telstra employees who were informed of the Industry Briefing, including by any of the persons referred to in (i) and (ii) above, 
 
 
 
 
 that refer or relate to the Program from 27 September 2006 onwards to determine which documents record communications within Telstra "relating to" the Industry Briefing between Telstra and DCITA on 27 September 2006, or record "any decisions made by Telstra resulting from" that Briefing. This is necessary because: 
 
 
 
 
 &#9679; of the breadth of the phrase "relating to" in sub-paragraph (a) of category 1; 
 
 &#9679; category 1 is not limited to documents in the possession of certain persons within Telstra; and 
 
 &#9679; category 1 is not limited to any date range other than being "after" 27 September 2006; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) in order to comply with category 2 of the Notice, Telstra would be required to review all documents referring or relating to the Program which are in the possession of at least: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Mr Smith; 
 
 (ii) the other Telstra employees who formed the core team responsible for developing Telstra's proposal in relation to the Program, 
 
 
 
 
 from at least 21 September 2006 (when the Guidelines in relation to the Program were released) until at least 18 June 2007 when Telstra received the letter dated 18 June 2007 from the Respondent advising Telstra that its bid had been unsuccessful for reasons including coverage; and 
 
 (e) in order to comply with category 8 of the Notice, Telstra would be required to review at least all documents in Telstra's possession held by: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Mr Smith; 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the at least 11 persons whom Mr Smith either immediately forwarded a copy of DCITA's letter of 18 June 2007 to, or discussed the letter with; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the 3 Telstra employees Mr Smith is aware received a copy (other than directly from him) of DCITA's letter of 18 June 2007; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) any other Telstra employees who received a copy of, or were informed of the contents of, DCITA's letter of 18 June 2007, including by any of the persons referred to in (ii) and (iii) above, 
 
 
 
 
 for the period from 18 June 2007 onwards to determine whether a document records "a consideration" by Telstra of DCITA's letter of 18 June 2007.'

59 It may be observed that the Minister's third Notice to Produce (Ex AM2) has introduced time frames limiting the documents, the production of which has been sought, and also confining the documents sought to ones recording communications and consideration at the level of what Mr Healy described as 'core team' members and/or members of Telstra's 'Executive Team' and above.</text>

<tocase>Waind v Hill and National Employers' Mutual General Association Ltd. (1978) 1 NSWLR 376</tocase>
<text>46 As Moffitt P, with whose judgment Hutley and Glass JJA agreed, said in Waind v Hill and National Employers' Mutual General Association Ltd. (1978) 1 NSWLR 376 ('Waind's case') at 381 there are three steps involved in dealing with subpoenas and documents that may be produced thereunder. At p381 Moffitt P said:
 
 'As Jordan C.J. pointed out in Small's case [The Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564] and, as appears in Burchard's case [Burchard v Macfarlane [1891] 2 QB 241] there are at least two steps in the procedure of having a third party bring documents to court, and in their use thereafter. Indeed, on a correct view, there are three steps. The first is obeying the subpoena, by the witness bringing the documents to the court and handing them to the judge. This step involves the determination of any objections of the witness to the subpoena, or to the production of the documents to the court pursuant to the subpoena. The second step is the decision of the judge concerning the preliminary use of the documents, which includes whether or not permission should be given to a party or parties to inspect the documents. The third step is the admission into evidence of the document in whole or in part; or the use of it in the process of evidence being put before the court by cross-examination or otherwise. It is the third step which alone provides material upon which ultimate decision in the case rests. In these three steps the stranger and the parties have different rights, and the function of the judge differs.'</text>

<tocase>Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/174.html</AustLII>
<text>47 Once documents have been produced to the court, any objections to their production having been rejected, the documents are in the control of the court. At this stage the person producing the documents may state that he objects to them being handed to a party seeking access to them for inspection. Documents should not go beyond the judge against the objection of the owner, unless there is valid reason to do so. Subject to matters such as confidentiality, it is for the judge, as part of the second step, to determine whether the documents appear relevant in the sense that they relate to the subject matter of the proceedings, in which event the judge will permit inspection by one or both parties at an appropriate time. The question of their admissibility without more, in accordance with the rules of evidence, does not then arise (per Moffitt P in Waind's case at 382 385 cf per Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] ).

48 The ultimate question of whether any documents are ruled to be relevant and/or admissible is left to the third stage of receiving evidence. As part of the second step inspection may be allowed, notwithstanding that a given document is not admissible as it stands, and notwithstanding that the party seeking inspection has not given any undertaking to tender it or use it in cross-examination (per Moffitt P in Waind's case at 385).

49 If a person wishes to resist production to the court of documents under a subpoena or in response to a notice to produce, objection should be taken as part of what Moffitt P describes as 'the first step'. Available grounds for objection to production include:
 
 (a) that the documents called for are the documents of title of the party burdened with production;
 (b) that the documents are privileged from production on the ground of self-incrimination;
 (c) that the documents are privileged from production on the ground of legal professional privilege;
 (d) that the documents are required for some spurious purpose unconnected with the litigation;
 (e) that the subpoena or notice to produce is oppressive in the sense that it is so wide as to impose an onerous task on the party burdened with production to collect and produce documents, many of which could have no apparent relevance to the litigation.</text>
