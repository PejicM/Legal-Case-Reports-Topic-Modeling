<tocase>Ayres v Chacos (1972) 19 FLR 468</tocase>
<text>41 Such language as "may only" in legislation is indicative of a need to comply with a set time limit, although not conclusive (see, for example, Bond v WorkCover Corporation of South Australia (2005) 93 SASR 315). However it is of some use to contrast the language in s 74B EPBC Act with that in s 459G Corporations Act , and similarly, for example, with:
 
&#8226; the legislation considered in Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 which provided that an application to renew a mining licence was required to be made "during the currency of such license... and not later than one month before the expiry of such license". In that case the High Court interpreted the legislation to mean that a valid application had to comply strictly with prescribed time limits; and
 
&#8226; the relevant section of the Liquor Ordinance 1929 (ACT) considered in Ayres v Chacos (1972) 19 FLR 468, which provided that "An applicant for the grant, removal or transfer of a licence...shall, not less than twenty-one days before making the application, give notice in writing to the Registrar and to an Inspector...". In the circumstances of that case Joske J held that the Licensing Court had no jurisdiction to deal with an application made on a period of notice less than the period of 21 clear days.

47 I agree with the submission of the Minister that it follows from the applicant's interpretation of the legislation that, immediately upon the expiration of the 20 business days time limit in s 74B(1), even in circumstances where the Minister considers that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts, the Minister's power to invoke Div 1A could not be exercised, and the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss 75, 87 and 88. I accept the Minister's submission that this interpretation is not supported by the terms of Ch 4 Pt 7. It is highly unlikely that the legislature would have intended that non-compliance with the time limit in s 74B would inevitably prevent the Minister from making a valid decision (cf Charles v Judicial and Legal Service Commission [2002] UKPC 34 at [12] ), particularly as, if the time limit under s 74B were absolute, the subsequent invalidation of any decision made under s 74B would result in substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s 74B. This is not a case where, for example:
 
&#8226; the consequences of failure to comply strictly within the prescribed time limit outweigh the public interest in the Minister making a valid decision that the proposed action would have unacceptable environmental impacts and invoking Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A (cf comments of the House of Lords in R v Soneji [2005] 3 WLR 303); or
 
&#8226; the object contemplated by the legislature could not be carried into effect unless the duty required by the statute were performed on or by a certain day (cf David Grant , Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 , Ayres v Chacos (1972) 19 FLR 468, Bowman v Blyth [1857] EngR 678 ; (1857) 7 E &amp; B 26, 119 ER 1165 , In re Petition of Douglass 46 NY 42 (1871) and cases discussed in Black HC, Handbook on the Construction and Interpretation of the Laws (The Lawbook Exchange Ltd, Clark, New Jersey, 2008) at 346).</text>

<tocase>Butler v Attorney-General for the State of Victoria [1961] HCA 32 ; (1961) 106 CLR 268</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1961/32.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The issue raised in submission by the applicant is encapsulated historically in the Latin maxim generalia specialibus non derogant (where there is a conflict between general and specific provisions, the specific provisions prevail). In my view the submission can be dealt with quickly. The rule of construction inherent in this maxim has its place only where contrariety is manifest: Reseck v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1975) 133 CLR 45 at 52-53, Butler v Attorney-General for the State of Victoria [1961] HCA 32 ; (1961) 106 CLR 268 at 276; R v Kearney; Ex parte Japanangka [1984] HCA 13 ; (1984) 158 CLR 395 at 421. In this case there is no inherent conflict between the operation of s 74B (or indeed Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A) on the one hand, and either s 156(3) or s 518(1) on the other. (I will address the applicant's submissions as to the interplay of s 74B and other provisions of Ch 4 Pt 7 later in this judgment.) The enactment of Div 1A subsequent in time to that of s 156(3) and s 518(1) gives rise to no inconsistency.</text>

<tocase>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd (1995) 184 CLR 265</tocase>
<text>23 The submissions of Mr Walker SC, who appeared for the applicant in these proceedings, may be summarised as follows:
 
1. The legislative provision pursuant to which the Minister made his decision was s 74B EPBC Act.
 
2. The validity of s 156(3) and s 518(1) EPBC Act as statutory provisions is not in contest, however in relation to the application of these sections s 74B is distinguishable from such provisions as ss 75, 88 and 130 because:
 
 
 a) section 74B does not impose any obligation on the Minister to make a decision of the kind referred to in those other sections;
 b) the operation of s 74B is conditional upon a decision of the Minister which satisfies s 74B(1), namely a decision of a particular description which is made within 20 business days after the Minister receives the referral. 
 

3. Section 156(3) and s 518(1) are concerned with the validity of decisions which there is an obligation to make.
 
4. The construction of s 74B urged by the Minister leads to absurd results because it places s 74B in conflict with other provisions of the EPBC Act.
 
5. A continuing right to make a decision under s 74B cannot co-exist with the alternative and inconsistent procedure under s 75 and s 87 EPBC Act.
 
6. If s 156(3) and s 518(1) are capable of applying to a decision purportedly made by the Minister under s 74B more than 20 business days after the receipt of a referral, it should be concluded that s 74B(1) evinces an intention to exclude the prima facie operation of those provisions.
 
7. The principles articulated in David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd (1995) 184 CLR 265 apply to this case.
 
8. Section 74B and Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A EPBC Act were inserted as part of a new process designed to enable the Minister to make a "prompt refusal" for a proposed action that would be clearly unlikely to receive approval under the other provisions of Ch 4. To treat a decision made any time outside the 20 business days referred to in s 74B(1) as effective to invoke s 74B(2) would be to dispense entirely with the "prompt refusal" rationale of the provision. This would be in direct conflict with the evident statutory purpose of s 74B and must be rejected by reason of s 15AA Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth).

30 The applicant has also submitted that s 156(3) and s 518(1) do not apply to s 74B because, paraphrasing an issue posed in David Grant (1995) 184 CLR 265: 
 [T]he difficulty in construction arises, perhaps not so much from the particular text of either [s.74B] or [ss.156(3) and 518(1)], as from the interrelation between those...provisions in circumstances where the enactment of [ss.156(3) and 518(1)] preceded that of [s.74B], and the earlier section is general and the later section is specific in its operation.

39 First, there is nothing in the language of s 74B which suggests that making a decision within 20 business days is a condition of validity of a decision made under that section. This can be contrasted with, for example, the language of s 459G Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to which the applicant referred in submissions, and which was the subject of consideration by the High Court in David Grant (1995) 184 CLR 265. Section 459G Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) provides:
 (1) A company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company. (2) An application may only be made within 21 days after the demand is so served. (3) An application is made in accordance with this section only if, within those 21 days: 
 
 (a) an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court; and
 
 (b) a copy of the application and a copy of the supporting affidavit, are served on the person who served the demand on the company.

40 In David Grant (1995) 184 CLR 265 the High Court observed at 276-277:
 In providing that an application to the court for an order setting aside a statutory demand "may only" be made within the 21 day period there specified and that an application is made in accordance with s 459G only if, within those 21 days, a supporting affidavit is filed and a copy thereof and of the applications are served, sub-ss (2) and (3) of s 459G attach a limitation or condition upon the authority of the court to set aside the demand. In this setting, the use in s 459G(2) of the term "may" does not give rise to the considerations which apply where legislation confers upon a decision-maker an authority of a discretionary kind and the issue is whether "may" is used in a facultative and permissive sense or an imperative sense (13). Here, the phrase "(a)n application may only be made within 21 days" should be read as a whole. The force of the term "may only" is to define the jurisdiction of the court by imposing a requirement as to time as an essential condition of the new right conferred by s 459G. An integer or element of the right created by s 459G is its exercise by application made within the time specified. To adapt what was said by Isaacs J in The Crown v McNeil (14), it is a condition of the gift in sub-s (1) of s 459G that sub-s (2) be observed and, unless this is so, the gift can never take effect. The same is true of sub-s (3). This consideration gives added force to the proposition which has been accepted in some of the authorities that it is impossible to identify the function or utility of the word "only" in s 459G(2) if it does not mean what it says, which is that the application is to be made within 21 days of service of the demand, and not at some time thereafter and that to treat s 1322 as authorising the court to extend the period of 21 days specified in s 459G would deprive the word "only" of effect (15).

47 I agree with the submission of the Minister that it follows from the applicant's interpretation of the legislation that, immediately upon the expiration of the 20 business days time limit in s 74B(1), even in circumstances where the Minister considers that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts, the Minister's power to invoke Div 1A could not be exercised, and the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss 75, 87 and 88. I accept the Minister's submission that this interpretation is not supported by the terms of Ch 4 Pt 7. It is highly unlikely that the legislature would have intended that non-compliance with the time limit in s 74B would inevitably prevent the Minister from making a valid decision (cf Charles v Judicial and Legal Service Commission [2002] UKPC 34 at [12] ), particularly as, if the time limit under s 74B were absolute, the subsequent invalidation of any decision made under s 74B would result in substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s 74B. This is not a case where, for example:
 
&#8226; the consequences of failure to comply strictly within the prescribed time limit outweigh the public interest in the Minister making a valid decision that the proposed action would have unacceptable environmental impacts and invoking Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A (cf comments of the House of Lords in R v Soneji [2005] 3 WLR 303); or
 
&#8226; the object contemplated by the legislature could not be carried into effect unless the duty required by the statute were performed on or by a certain day (cf David Grant , Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 , Ayres v Chacos (1972) 19 FLR 468, Bowman v Blyth [1857] EngR 678 ; (1857) 7 E &amp; B 26, 119 ER 1165 , In re Petition of Douglass 46 NY 42 (1871) and cases discussed in Black HC, Handbook on the Construction and Interpretation of the Laws (The Lawbook Exchange Ltd, Clark, New Jersey, 2008) at 346).</text>

<tocase>Hatton v Beaumont (1977) 2 NSWLR 211</tocase>
<text>32 As Mahoney JA observed in Hatton v Beaumont (1977) 2 NSWLR 211 at 225:
 The administration of the law would be facilitated if, in the formulating of legislation, attention were given as a matter of routine to this question. If this were done by a specific indication in the particular enactments of the effect of non-compliance with its provisions...or by a general enactment which provided for relief against the consequences of non-compliance with a mandatory statute, the cases of the present kind would be, if not avoided, at least greatly reduced in number. (cf Helman v Byron Shire Council (1995) 87 LGERA 349 at 355, Ceric v CE Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd [1993] NTSC 86 ; (1993) 91 NTR 26 at 39)

43 However in any event, and more compellingly in relation to s 74B, neither the purpose nor the structure of Ch 4 Pt 7 as a whole support a construction of s 74B that a decision made under that section after the expiration of 20 business days is invalid. Although the legislative purpose in enacting Div 1A was to facilitate a prompt refusal by the Minister of an action which would have unacceptable environmental impacts, the legislation does not support an interpretation that a decision made by the Minister on, for example, the 21st business day after the referral would not be of equal validity to a decision made within the prescribed time period. The event upon which the operation of the section depends is the prompt making of a decision by the Minister that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts, not the passage of 20 business days. In other words the making of a decision of the Minister is critical the time period of 20 business days, while relevant to the making of the decision, does not determine its validity (cf Hatton v Beaumont (1977) 2 NSWLR 211 at 224). To paraphrase the learned authors of Administrative Law in Australia , to which I referred earlier in this judgment, the provision as to time in s 74B simply regulates a function which has already been conferred on the decision-maker, namely that of making a decision in the circumstances described in s 74B(1)(a) EPBC Act.

44 Explanation as to the legislative purpose of Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A (including s 74B) can be found in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2006 (Cth) which inserted Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A into the EPBC Act. So far as relevant the Explanatory Memorandum provides as follows:
 78. This item inserts new Division 1A of Part 7 of the Act. Division 1A establishes a new process that allows the Minister to make a prompt refusal for an action that would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected by Part 3 of the Act. This avoids the expense and time involved in conducting the full assessment and approval process under Chapter 4 for actions that would be unlikely to receive approval under Part 9 of the Act. The scope and process for making a prompt refusal is established in three new sections of the Act &#172; 74B, 74C, and 74D. 79. If the Minister considers that an action would have unacceptable impacts on a matter protected under Part 3 of the Act on the basis of the information contained in a referral then the Minister may decide under s 74B that Division 1A applies to the action. The other provisions of Chapter 4 (referral assessment and approvals processes) then cease to apply to the action. Under s 74C the Minister must then notify the person proposing to take the action and provide reasons why the action is unacceptable. The person may withdraw the referral, withdraw the referral and refer a new proposal, or request the Minister to reconsider the referral. 80. New s 74D outlines the process to be followed in the event the Minister is asked to reconsider the referral. At the completion of this process the Minister may either confirm that the action is not to be approved, or determine that it should be subject to the formal assessment and approvals processes under the Act. If the Minister decides that the referral should be assessed, the Chapter 4 processes and timeframes recommence at the point where they were initially stopped under s 74B of the Act.

45 Significantly, I note that the Explanatory Memorandum makes no mention of the 20 business day time period, nor is any importance attached to that period of time. Consistently with the proposition that it is the making of the decision which is critical, the Explanatory Memorandum refers to promptitude, and the avoidance of expense and time otherwise applied in making a full assessment.</text>

<text>32 As Mahoney JA observed in Hatton v Beaumont (1977) 2 NSWLR 211 at 225:
 The administration of the law would be facilitated if, in the formulating of legislation, attention were given as a matter of routine to this question. If this were done by a specific indication in the particular enactments of the effect of non-compliance with its provisions...or by a general enactment which provided for relief against the consequences of non-compliance with a mandatory statute, the cases of the present kind would be, if not avoided, at least greatly reduced in number. (cf Helman v Byron Shire Council (1995) 87 LGERA 349 at 355, Ceric v CE Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd [1993] NTSC 86 ; (1993) 91 NTR 26 at 39)</text>

<text>47 I agree with the submission of the Minister that it follows from the applicant's interpretation of the legislation that, immediately upon the expiration of the 20 business days time limit in s 74B(1), even in circumstances where the Minister considers that the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts, the Minister's power to invoke Div 1A could not be exercised, and the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss 75, 87 and 88. I accept the Minister's submission that this interpretation is not supported by the terms of Ch 4 Pt 7. It is highly unlikely that the legislature would have intended that non-compliance with the time limit in s 74B would inevitably prevent the Minister from making a valid decision (cf Charles v Judicial and Legal Service Commission [2002] UKPC 34 at [12] ), particularly as, if the time limit under s 74B were absolute, the subsequent invalidation of any decision made under s 74B would result in substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s 74B. This is not a case where, for example:
 
&#8226; the consequences of failure to comply strictly within the prescribed time limit outweigh the public interest in the Minister making a valid decision that the proposed action would have unacceptable environmental impacts and invoking Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A (cf comments of the House of Lords in R v Soneji [2005] 3 WLR 303); or
 
&#8226; the object contemplated by the legislature could not be carried into effect unless the duty required by the statute were performed on or by a certain day (cf David Grant , Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 , Ayres v Chacos (1972) 19 FLR 468, Bowman v Blyth [1857] EngR 678 ; (1857) 7 E &amp; B 26, 119 ER 1165 , In re Petition of Douglass 46 NY 42 (1871) and cases discussed in Black HC, Handbook on the Construction and Interpretation of the Laws (The Lawbook Exchange Ltd, Clark, New Jersey, 2008) at 346).</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/29.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The submissions of Mr Gotterson QC, who appeared for the Minister in these proceedings, may be summarised as follows:
 
1. Section 156(3) and s 518 are express provisions in the EPBC Act which put beyond doubt that it is clearly not a purpose of the EPBC Act that an act done outside a time period set by the EPBC Act should be invalid.
 
2. Even apart from those provisions, the same result is achieved by applying the approach to statutory interpretation as articulated in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355. 
 
3. The purpose of Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A EPBC Act, which was inserted into the EPBC Act in 2006 by the Environmental and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2006 , was explained in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying that legislation.
 
4. Section 75 and s 88 also call for "prompt" decisions to be made.
 
5. Importantly, a prompt refusal under s 74B avoids the expense and time involved in conducting the full assessment and approval process for an action that is unlikely to receive approval.
 
6. The construction of s 74B advanced by the applicant risks substantial frustration of the ultimate purpose of s 74B.
 
7. On the applicant's argument once the 20 business days have elapsed the Minister must proceed to make decisions under ss 75, 87 and 88 even if the Minister considers the proposed action will have unacceptable environmental impacts. This is precisely what s 74B was intended to avoid.
 
8. The real condition precedent to the application of Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A is the formation of the opinion by the Minister. While the Minister is obliged and required to act within the time specified in s 74B, it does not follow that the consequence of a late decision is that it is invalid and of no effect.

25 In my view, substantially for the reasons advanced by Mr Gotterson QC on behalf of the Minister, the application must fail.

26 Notwithstanding the detailed submissions of the applicant, a plain reading of the EPBC Act demonstrates clearly that failure of the Minister to comply with a time limit prescribed by the EPBC Act does not affect the validity of a decision under the Act made outside a set time limit, including decisions made under s 74B. No contortion of the legislation or speculation as to the manner in which s 74B is to be construed in the broader context of Ch 4 Pt 7 detracts from the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in s 156(3) and s 518(1) EPBC Act. That the failure of the Minister to comply with a time limit set by the EPBC Act does not affect its validity is clear not only in relation to any action of the Minister under the Act as a whole (s 518(1)), but, in my view crucially, is clear in relation to any decision made by the Minister under Ch 4 EPBC Act (s 156(3)). Although the legislation reflects an apparent duplication so far as concerns decisions under Ch 4 (which, presumably, would also fall within the scope of actions of the Minister for the purposes of s 518(1)) the effect of that duplication is to remove any doubt as to the validity of decisions made under Ch 4, including those in Pt 7 Div 1A and more specifically s 74B, notwithstanding a failure to comply with a set time limit.

35 However putting to one side for the moment my views concerning the application of s 156(3) and s 518(1), I consider that in any event the legislative purpose of the EPBC Act is that a decision made by the Minister under s 74B more than 20 business days after receipt of a referral will be valid. This is clear from applying the principles articulated in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 , as well as taking into consideration the explanation of Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying that Division introduction into the EPBC.

36 The majority of the High Court observed in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355: 
 an act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. (at 388-389, cf at 390-391)

37 As was observed in commentary on Project Blue Sky (1998) CLR 355 (in my view correctly):
 On this approach...there is a fundamental difference between a provision which simply regulates a function which has already been conferred on the decision-maker and a provision which establishes an essential pre-condition to the valid exercise of the function. (Lane WB and Young S, Administrative Law in Australia (Lawbook Co, 2007) at 133)

38 Applying the principles articulated in Project Blue Sky [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 to the facts of the case before me, an important question is whether the legislative purpose of the EPBC Act is that a decision made by the Minister under s 74B more than 20 business days after the referral is received is invalid, taking into account the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition.

46 Historically there is a wealth of authority supporting the principle that failure to perform an act within time limits prescribed by legislation does not necessarily invalidate the act notwithstanding that it is made after the expiration of that time limit. While these cases, and the extent to which the courts applied the traditional distinction between directory and mandatory requirements, must be read in light of the test for determining validity articulated in Project Blue Sky [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 , nonetheless it is useful to note that traditionally:
 where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the Legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed, or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, when an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, that the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time. Thus, the 13 Hen. IV. (c.7), which required justices to try rioters "within a month" after the riot, was held not to limit the authority of the justices to that space of time, but only to render them liable to a penalty for neglect.

<text>31 The issue raised in submission by the applicant is encapsulated historically in the Latin maxim generalia specialibus non derogant (where there is a conflict between general and specific provisions, the specific provisions prevail). In my view the submission can be dealt with quickly. The rule of construction inherent in this maxim has its place only where contrariety is manifest: Reseck v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1975) 133 CLR 45 at 52-53, Butler v Attorney-General for the State of Victoria [1961] HCA 32 ; (1961) 106 CLR 268 at 276; R v Kearney; Ex parte Japanangka [1984] HCA 13 ; (1984) 158 CLR 395 at 421. In this case there is no inherent conflict between the operation of s 74B (or indeed Ch 4 Pt 7 Div 1A) on the one hand, and either s 156(3) or s 518(1) on the other. (I will address the applicant's submissions as to the interplay of s 74B and other provisions of Ch 4 Pt 7 later in this judgment.) The enactment of Div 1A subsequent in time to that of s 156(3) and s 518(1) gives rise to no inconsistency.</text>
