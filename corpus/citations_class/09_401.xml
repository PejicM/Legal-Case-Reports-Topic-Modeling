<tocase>Whitlam v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 183 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 559</tocase>

<text>The proxy forms are, in my opinion, to be considered and construed as commercial documents. They are, in substance, directions or appointments by a principal to an agent authorising the agent to act on behalf of the principal in a particular way. In such circumstances there is a duty upon the agent (the proxy) to abide by the direction or instruction given by the principal (the shareholder): Whitlam v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 183 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 559 at 600-601 at par [152].

The Company filed four affidavits sworn by four shareholders in the Company who had completed and lodged proxy forms in which they had appointed the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy but had not otherwise marked any of the "For", "Against" or "Abstain" boxes on the form. Those shareholders said that they did not provide any directions as to how the proxy was to vote and that they appointed the proxy to vote as he saw fit. They said they appointed the Chairman as their proxy expecting that Mr Pursell, Managing Director, was to be Chairman and that they expected at the time they completed the proxies that the Chairman would vote in favour of resolution 1 (the removal of Mr Campbell as a director), against resolutions 4, 5, 6 and 7 (the removal of the current Board) and against resolutions 8, 9, 10 and 11 (the appointment of the alternate board). The shareholders said that at no point of time did they expect, or want, their proxy to vote in favour of all resolutions put forward at the EGM.

The secretary of the Company, Mr John Lawrence Neill, said in an affidavit that between 14 and 16 April 2009 he had received 16 letters from shareholders who provided an "open-useable proxy" (that is to say, undirected proxies) to the Chairman and who were concerned that the applicants were submitting that the votes cast as a consequence of these open-useable proxies should be counted as affirmative votes for each of the eleven resolutions and not as cast by the Chairman of the meeting.</text>
