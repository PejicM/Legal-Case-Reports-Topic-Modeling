<tocase>ASX Operations Pty Ltd v Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd (No1) (1990) 27 FCR 460</tocase>
<text>The passage in ASX Operations Pty Ltd v Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd (No1) (1990) 27 FCR 460 (" Pont Data" ) at 488 referred to by Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J was as follows: 
[The persons or classes excluded] ... are identified ... by the characteristic that they may not be supplied with the information in question, unless they accept and become bound by the restraint imposed by the [relevant] agreement] ... What distinguishes the class and makes it particular is that its members are objects of an anti-competitive purpose, with which s 4D is concerned.

This can be said to permit the identification of the particular persons or classes of person by reference to the operation of the provision. As Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J show in footnote 132 in Rural Press (HC), whilst Callinan J in Souths expressed opposition to such an operation of s 4D, Gummow J, with whom McHugh J agreed, did not, and, indeed cited this passage in Souths . Neither Gleeson CJ nor Kirby J in Souths referred to the passage in question from Pont Data .

In Pont Data the Full Court said at 476 and 477 about s 4F: 
 s 4F uses the words 'the provision was included in the contract ... for that purpose or for purposes that included or include that purpose'. This indicates that s 4F, in this operation, requires one to look to the purposes of the individuals by whom the provision was included ... 
 

 
 ... 
 

 
 ...it is therefore appropriate to look at the purposes of the party as a result of whose efforts they were included

In Souths , Gleeson CJ said at [18] that it was the subjective purpose of "News and ARL in including the fourteen team ... that is to be determined." His Honour referred with approval to Pont Data at 474-77 as to this point. McHugh J at [41] concurred with the view that it was the subjective purpose of the makers of the provision. In so doing he gave weight to the body of Full Federal Court authority, including implicitly, Pont Data. Gummow J at [62] specifically cited Pont Data at 476 and said that s 4F required examination of the purposes of the individuals by whom the provision was included and noted that the "substantial purpose" test avoids difficulties in discerning the relevant purpose of multiple parties to a contract, arrangement or understanding. Callinan J at [212] referred to the parties' subjective reason for the inclusion of the provision in the contract, arrangement or understanding and in so stating referred specifically to, amongst other cases, Pont Data at 474-77.

The Commission's case was that in each case Woolworths and Liquorland were parties to the contract, arrangement or understanding. Each was competitive with the other in relation to the supply of take-away packaged liquor. This satisfied s 4D(1)(a) of the Act. It was also said that each licence applicant was likely to be competitive with Woolworths and Liquorland in the supply of takeaway packaged liquor, but for the provisions in question, for the purposes of s 4D(2) and thereby s 4D(1)(a).

The Commission also asserted that the purpose of the provisions in the deeds was to prevent, restrict or limit the supply of takeaway packaged liquor by the licence applicants to one or more of the following classes of persons: (a) customers and potential customers of the licence applicants and (b) customers and potential customers of each Woolworths and Liquorland bottle shop in the vicinity. It was unnecessary to be able to identify the individual members of the class. It was capable of being a "future" class, which was identifiable at the time of the making of the contract, arrangement or understanding. The legitimacy of this element of possible futurity was assisted, it was said, by the terms of s 4D(2) which identifies a future or contingent state of affairs. Section 4D(1) should, it was said, be given a construction conformable with the future, contingent aspects of the section's possible operation in relation to contracts, arrangements or understandings.

Importantly, it was submitted that unless the Commission proved the purpose of each of the parties to the deeds it must lose this part of the case. That is so, it was said, because without it the second stage in (b) cannot be undertaken. Pont Data was said to be irrelevant to this case because no party entered the deed under protest or complaint. That being so, it was said, it was necessary to consider the purposes of all the parties to the deed.

Turning to the purposes of the parties in including the provision, Woolworths submitted that the Commission confused the purpose of the provision with the purpose of lodging the objection and failed to understand the effect of the Liquor Act on unlicensed persons. At the time of the execution of the deed, the purpose of Woolworths was not to prevent the issue of an unconditional licence, because by that time, to Woolworths' knowledge, each applicant was not seeking an unconditional licence.

Further, it was submitted that even if Woolworths' purpose in entering the contract was to prevent the issue of an unconditional licence that was not a purpose of limiting supply to particular persons or classes of persons. This was so because at the time of execution of the deeds the licence applicants had no lawful entitlement to supply the goods to which the provision related. Such an existing, lawful entitlement was, it was said, a necessary precondition for the engagement of s 4D. At the time of the entry into the deeds, the licence applicants were prohibited by the Liquor Act from selling takeaway packaged liquor. Also, as to Palms Village, the provision did not prevent, restrict or limit the supply of any takeaway liquor, because the restrictions were as to stocking, site and configuration of the shop. There was, it was said, no relevant prevention, limitation or restriction on sale to any particular person or class of person.

One answer given by Ms Stapleton when being asked about the Dry Dock bottle shop revealed a mundane, but important, distinction that was related to the notion of competition and substitution. The following exchange took place: You don't list the Dry Dock Bottle Shop in paragraph 34 [of your statement] as a main competitor. No. 

 Why is that? It's a very small store. 

 Would you regard it as a competitor at all? Oh, everyone's a competitor, but not a main competitor. 

There are competitors and there are main competitors. There is competition and there is close competition. The analysis and the description depends on the context.
 Mr Gordon

Mr Michael Gordon was called by the Commission. He was the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of "Liquor Marketing Group" ("LMG"). He had been involved for most of his working life since the 1970s in the liquor industry. He and a partner established the Liquorland chain of stores, and later the Mac's Liquor chain, before each was sold, respectively, to Coles and Woolworths. Mr Gordon was articulate, intelligent and helpful.

LMG was a hotel liquor buying and marketing group with over one thousand members.

I have also dealt with the purpose of each of the parties to the deeds. In each case, Woolworths, on the evidence, was one of the parties as a result of whose efforts the relevant provisions were included. I reject the submission of Woolworths that Pont Data is irrelevant because that case only has relevance where a provision or deed is entered into or undertaken under protest. In each case, the provisions were included as a result of the efforts of Woolworths and Liquorland. In any event, the purposes of the other parties can be inferred as I have.

Section 4F does not require that there be one substantial purpose or the substantial purpose, the relevant purpose need only be a substantial purpose.

Woolworths submitted that the particularity of the persons or class must arise entirely otherwise than by the characteristic of being excluded from supply. Reliance was placed on what Callinan J said in Souths at [189]. However, as I sought to show earlier, the passage from Pont Data (set out at [58] above) which was criticised by Woolworths has not been disapproved. In my view, the passage referred to at [58] above is an expression of view by a Full Court of this Court (Lockhart, Gummow and von Doussa JJ) in a joint judgment which I should follow. Thus, relevant to the particularity of the class, is the fact that its members are the objects of the purpose in question.

It was submitted by Woolworths that the class cannot be "some unidentified potential group of customers". The relevant question is not an isolated proposition capable of independent analysis; rather, the relevant question is whether, on the facts as they present themselves here, a purpose of each relevant provision was to prevent, restrict or limit the supply of goods to particular persons or class of person. The degree of definition and the common characteristics that lead one to the conclusion that a class is "particular" is not capable of being expressed otherwise than by application of the language chosen by Parliament to the facts and purpose in question. To seek to do so is to embark on a process of deconstructing, or glossing, of Parliament's words with the almost inevitable (and certainly impermissible) substitution of a different word or phrase for that chosen by Parliament. That one person's view that the definition of a class to which the purpose in question was directed is sufficiently "particular" to fall within the section is open to debate is an inevitable consequence of the indeterminate frame of reference contained within the adjective "particular".

It is necessary to turn to the episodes here and assess whether s 4D (and so, s 45(2)(a)(i) and (b)(i)) is satisfied. Ettamogah</text>

<tocase>Eastern Express Ltd v General Newspapers (1992) 35 FCR 43</tocase>
<text>Woolworths referred to a strategic plan for Woolworths for liquor for the years 2003 to 2007. (See Exhibit WW, tab 157.) This document looked at the Australian retail packaged liquor market and set out national sales broken down by state. No doubt for some purposes of strategy and overall assessment, Woolworths looked at the liquor industry from a national perspective. It was a national organisation. Nevertheless, within that national and state analysis the document incorporated, for the purposes of discussion, important considerations about customer profile that conformed with the material referred to by the Commission: 2.3.1 Customer Profile 

 
 General 
 Convenience (strongest attribute by far!) Price Knowledgeable and Friendly Staff Large Product Range Easy Parking Opening Hours 

 
 High Value Customers 
 High value customers represent 40% of liquor purchases but over 90% of liquor revenue and profit Convenience is the most important factor in format choice They plan what they will buy in advance &amp; stick to familiar products They purchase over 70% of their liquor in one store

One methodological aspect of the Leading Edge survey was said to detract from the utility of the results. In the analysis of the research which led to the conclusion that "convenience is about twice as important as any other customer need", there were differential weightings given for the reasons, depending on the importance of the reason and whether it was the main or other store used. It was said to be important for the SSNIP test that customers shop at a number of liquor outlets even without a price increase. I do not see why this should be so. I do not see how this submission substantially eliminates the weight to be given to this material.

Woolworths made a legitimate point about Exhibit VV tab 99 at p 47-00492. This was used as the basis for the representation at [459(d)] above. Woolworths pointed out a fact relevant to the consideration of these representations and how they are to be assessed with the expert evidence . This was that the top 10% most sensitive customers were excluded. These are people most likely to travel in the face of a SSNIP.

Debate took place on the meaning of the word "substantially". Great care needs to be taken in debate about the content of such words. In s 46 "substantial" means "a considerable or large degree of such power", when qualifying market power: Eastern Express Ltd v General Newspapers (1992) 35 FCR 43 at 63; and Universal Music at [131]-[132]. In relation to the word "substantial" in s 4F(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) Heerey J said the following in Monroe Topple at [97]: 
 Did the proscribed purpose, if it existed, loom large among the objects the corporation sought to achieve?"</text>

<text>Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J also emphasised that there is no requirement of "aiming at" or "targeting" anyone, to the extent that it might be seen as carrying notions of animus or intended harm: Rural Press (HC) at [70] citing Gummow J in News Ltd v South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2003] HCA 45 ; (2003) 215 CLR 563 ( "Souths" ) at [76]-[79]. Dealing with the facts before them, Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J said the following at [71]: 
 The purpose of the provision in this case was "directed towards" the readers and advertisers in the Mannum area because it was a purpose of maintaining the market power of the Rural Press parties in that area by limiting the supply of services to the readers and advertisers through causing the circulation of the River News to their advantage to cease. The readers and advertisers were objects, "on, or about whom" that purpose operated.

The particularity of purpose in Rural Press as found by the trial judge was as follows (set out at 216 CLR at [57]): 
 preventing or restricting or limiting the supply of services to the particular class or classes of persons, being those in the Mannum area (or in that area and extending to a [line] about 40 km north of Mannum) who could otherwise receive the information and news in the River News or who could otherwise advertise in the River News or take advantage of advertising in the River News .

Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J said the following at [87] and [88] as to the adequacy of this particularity: 
 The purpose found by the trial judge is entirely consistent with the evidence, particularly the internal records of and the conduct of the Rural Press parties. In the circumstances it is sufficient to say that the trial judge adequately defined a class: even though the identity of all of its members at any one time might not be readily ascertainable, s 4D does not require that. Even if s 4D does require that, it would be possible to draw up a list of advertisers who had used the River News , and that would be a sufficient class to render the provision an exclusionary provision. It would also be possible to draw up a list, though perhaps an incomplete list, of readers of the River News . The Commission's contentions cannot be dismissed by reason of issues on which such limited argument was offered. 
 

 
 The same is true of the question, which had a faint presence in argument, of whether it is erroneous to define a particular class by the fact of its exclusion from supply or acquisition. In ASX Operations Pty Ltd v Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd [No 1] there is a passage which some have alleged to rest on an error of this kind. In this case no argument was directed in this Court to the question; the Full Federal Court came to no view about it; and News Ltd v South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd did not overrule the case in that respect and only one member of this Court criticised it. In any event, to define a particular class by reference to its geographical location is not to define it by the fact of its exclusion from supply or acquisition, because it is identified at the time of the arrangement and indeed identifiable before that time.

<text>Particulars were sought and provided in relation to the suburban areas pleaded. In the provision of those particulars a measure of flexibility was sought to be retained by the Commission. The relevant areas were particularised as follows: 
The Arncliffe area
 

 
 Paragraph B1.16 defines "the Arncliffe area" as Arncliffe or the close vicinity of Arncliffe. 
 

 
 The Arncliffe area is depicted on maps 315 and 316 in the seventh edition of the Sydway Greater Sydney and Blue Mountains Street Directory published by Sydway Publishing Pty Ltd, July 2001. 
 

 
 The geographic bounds of the Arncliffe area cannot be stated exactly, nor is it necessary to be stated exactly (see Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v BHP Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 195-196, Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v TPC (1989) ATPR 40-932 at 50,011 &amp; 50,097 , Davids Holdings Pty Ltd v Attorney General (1994) ATPR 41-304 at 42,091, ACCC v Rural Press (2001) ATPR 41-804 at 42,736, para [103], ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 149 at [293] - [297] ).

The Tweed Heads area
 

 
 Paragraph B4.9 defines "the Tweed Heads area" as Tweed Heads or the close vicinity of Tweed Heads. 
 

 
 The Tweed Heads area is depicted on page 447 in the fourteenth edition of the UBD New South Wales CountryLink Street &amp; Travel Directory published by Universal Press Pty Ltd, 2002. 
 

 
 Otherwise, the Applicant repeats the third paragraph of its response to 24(a), (b).

The references in the third paragraph of the response to 24(a) and (b) made clear the Commission's intention to maintain flexibility at the boundary of the market. Deane J in Queensland Wire Industry Proprietary Limited v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited [1989] HCA 6 ; (1988) 167 CLR 177 at 195-96 spoke of the outer limits of markets, including their geographical confines, to be "blurred". Sheppard J in Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1989]) ATPR 40-932 at 50,097, referred to what Deane J had said in Queensland Wire and also spoke of the arbitrary exercise of the drawing of any line to define the geographic market and there always being a "fuzziness" about geographic definition of the market. See also Davids Holdings Pty Ltd v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (1994) 49 FCR 211.

I have sought at [429] above to encapsulate something which has been said by scholars and courts about the nature of the process of market definition. Market definition is to be approached by beginning with the problem at hand and asking what market identification best assists the assessment of the conduct and its asserted anti-competitive attributes. See generally, Norman N and Williams P "The Analysis of Market and Competition and the Trade Practices Act : Towards the Resolution of Some Hitherto Unresolved Issues" (1983) 11 Australian Business Law Review 399 at 400-401; Queensland Wire (FC) at 218-219; Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1988) 167 CLR 177 at 195 (" Queensland Wire (HC)"); Brunt op cit p 236. This approach has been followed in many cases: for some, see Corones SG, Competition Law in Australia (3 rd Ed) p 42 ftnt 15. As the Trade Practices Tribunal (of which Professor Brunt was a member) said in Re Media Council of Australia [1996] ATPR 41-497 at 42,262: 
 [t]he choice of market definition, ie the specification of relevant markets in the particular case, must depend upon the issues for determination. For the Tribunal's purposes it is the identification of a market or markets that best enables it to evaluate the likely effects of authorized conduct, whether the subject of past authorisation or possible future authorisation.

This is not the abrogation of principled analysis in favour of the impugned conduct determining the market. Rather, it is to recognise the consequence of market definition being a tool for analysis and not a physical thing, or essence, which can be identified in a manner divorced from the relevant context. An analysis of market power in Australia in relation to the liquor industry for the purposes of merger evaluation under s 50 of the Act may not turn upon individual analyses of the degree of competition in suburban or regional areas as small as Arncliffe, Campbelltown or Tweed Heads. However, the assessment of the purposes of Woolworths (through Messrs Smith and Meagher) in the placement of the relevant clauses into deeds with prospective local shopkeepers in order to prevent competitive sales from new licences detracting from the sales and hence profitability of their own local suburban liquor shops provides another framework of analysis entirely. The facts and perspectives of analysis in the two circumstances are different. It is the market that best enables evaluation of Woolworths' conduct that is relevant.

Thus, the identification of the market as the correct analytical tool or instrumental concept to assess the conduct in question will be assisted by the recognition of the close competition and factors dealing with constraints that may be seen to be affected or advanced by the conduct in question. This relationship between the conduct the subject of analysis, and the correct market for its analysis takes place in the context where value judgments must be made in an economy where markets overlap and where the geographical boundaries (for the reasons given earlier) are likely to be blurred: cf Queensland Wire (HC) at 195-96 per Deane J.</text>

<tocase>Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd; Re Defiance Holdings Ltd (1976) 25 FLR 169</tocase>
<text>In this process of identifying the correct analytical tool or instrumental concept of market definition by which to assess Woolworths' conduct and purposes in this case, there is significant assistance in recalling the seminal expression of view of the Tribunal (of which Professor Brunt was a member) in Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd; Re Defiance Holdings Ltd (1976) 25 FLR 169 ("QCMA") at 190 (a passage approved by the High Court in Boral at [133] per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J, in this respect agreed with by Gaudron J, Gummow J and Hayne J) : 
 We take the concept of a market to be basically a very simple idea. A market is the area of close competition between firms or, putting it a little differently, the field of rivalry between them. (If there is no close competition there is of course a monopolistic market.) Within the bounds of a market there is substitution--substitution between one product and another, and between one source of supply and another, in response to changing prices. So a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive. Let us suppose that the price of one supplier goes up. Then on the demand side buyers may switch their patronage from this firm's product to another, or from this geographic source of supply to another. As well, on the supply side, sellers can adjust their production plans, substituting one product for another in their output mix, or substituting one geographic source of supply for another. Whether such substitution is feasible or likely depends ultimately on customer attitudes, technology, distance, and cost and price incentives. 
 

 
 It is the possibilities of such substitution which set the limits upon a firm's ability to "give less and charge more". Accordingly, in determining the outer boundaries of the market we ask a quite simple but fundamental question: If the firm were to "give less and charge more" would there be, to put the matter colloquially, much of a reaction? And if so, from whom? In the language of economics the question is this: From which products and which activities could we expect a relatively high demand or supply response to price change, i.e. a relatively high cross-elasticity of demand or cross-elasticity of supply?

At least two elements of this passage are to be steadily borne in mind in identifying the markets here. First, it is the area of close competition. The relative and evaluative judgment as to the degree of closeness of competition relevant to the assessment of the conduct is important. Here, the question is the assessment of the purpose of Woolworths and Liquorland in undertaking conduct directed at local competitors. The degree of closeness of competition in the local area may be seen to be different from, or more important than, the degree of closeness of competition from a broader geographic perspective. In other words, merely because there is what can be said to be close competition on price across the Sydney conurbation for retail liquor, does not gainsay a local market, being a field or area of even closer competition between sellers in suburban areas. Secondly, the notion of giving less and charging more and thus constraint on activity is central to the analysis. This, as with the notion of close competition, can occur at different levels of commercial behaviour and organisation.</text>

<text>The applicants for the licences, as new entrants into the market, were denied the freedom to expand or reconfigure their businesses better to meet market requirements and competitive offerings or to sell the unrestricted licence to someone better placed to exploit it. Either would have seen the process of competition work rather than be stifled. Thus, it was said that competition was "nipped in the bud": Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) 13 ATPR 41-076 at p 52, 155; and Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [129] .

The case of Woolworths directed attention to the precise terms of the case pleaded against it and the precise effect of the construction it placed on s 4D of the Act. A full discussion of those issues is better left to a point at which the facts of each episode are fully explored. Briefly, however, it was contended that the case of the Commission rested on a number of flaws. First, it gave inadequate weight to the context of the practical operation, and day-to-day practice under the regime of the Liquor Act . The particular aspect of this inadequacy was said to be the failure to appreciate that objection on the needs ground was commonly taken by licence holders of all descriptions against all new applications. It was said to be a commonplace event that applicants would seek the grant of an off-licence retail, subject to conditions which reflected the business sought to be carried on, and no wider.

Secondly, the Commission's case confused or conflated the purposes of Woolworths in making the objection and in entering the deeds. The two, it was said, were distinct only the latter being the pleaded purpose. This distinction was said to be important and one based on the evidence of Messrs Meagher and Smith, the two relevant officers of Woolworths. They gave evidence that had there been no deeds agreed, the applications would have been fought, and, they believed, won. Thus, it was submitted that whilst the purpose of making the objection might be said to be "anti-competitive" (being directed to preventing a new, competitive, or potentially competitive, licence), the purpose of the impugned deed was to record the terms of the settlement of litigation which they believed would be won, if fought. Their purposes should be seen in that light; and if that is done, their purposes must be seen as other than found in ss 45(2) and 4D.

Market definition is not an exact physical exercise to identify a physical feature of the world; nor is it the enquiry after the nature of some form of essential existence. Rather, it is the recognition and use of an economic tool or instrumental concept related to market power, constraints on power and the competitive process which is best adapted to analyse the asserted anti-competitive conduct.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/75.html</AustLII>
<text>Before turning to the contentions of the parties as to the construction of s 4D a number of considerations concerning s 4D expressed by the High Court and the Full Court of this Court should be noted. In Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press (HC)") Gleeson CJ and Callinan J emphasised the need for the requisite degree of particularity of the object or objects of the provision, saying at [6]: 
 If attention were not paid to the compound nature of an exclusionary provision, and the requirement of particularity of its object or objects, there is a danger that s 4D would be given an operation that would greatly reduce the statutory significance of lessening competition, in relation to agreements between competitors generally. Contracts, arrangements or understandings between competitors commonly involve some form of prevention, restriction or limitation of supply or acquisition of goods or services. If two hairdressers in a suburban main street were to have an understanding that one would provide services to men, and one would provide services to women, it may be unlikely that their understanding would involve a substantial lessening of competition in a market. It would be surprising if it were held, nevertheless, to contravene the Act. To the extent to which it had an anti-competitive purpose, that purpose would not be "directed toward" particular persons or classes of persons. 
 
 [Footnotes omitted]

Whilst Gleeson CJ and Callinan J agreed with Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ that there was sufficient particularity in that case, their Honours said the following at [7] and [8] about the purpose of preventing , restricting or limiting supply or acquisition: 
 We agree with Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ that there was sufficient particularity in the present case, but we can think of other cases in which it would be absent, notwithstanding the existence of a purpose of preventing, restricting, or limiting supply or acquisition. If it were not so, the references to particular persons or classes of persons would be redundant. 
 

 
 ... In its original form, the proscribed purpose was of preventing, restricting or limiting supply to or acquisition from particular persons. The words "or classes of persons" were added in 1986, following some decisions that were thought to reveal an undue narrowness in the legislation in its original form. Those words were clearly intended to widen the provision, but not to change its entire character. The proscribed purpose must still be one that is directed toward particular persons or classes of persons. Parliament did not delete the word "particular" and substitute the word "any". Nor did it remove all reference to persons as objects of the proscribed purpose. The legislative history, as well as the text, tends strongly against a reading of the section which requires only that a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose of preventing, restricting or limiting, in any way, supply or acquisition. Supply or acquisition will always be to or from persons. Ordinary principles of construction require that the references to particular persons or classes of persons be given work to do; they are not mere drafting verbosity. A court construing a provision in an Act "must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision". A court will seek to avoid a construction of a statute that renders some of its language otiose. Here, that consideration is powerfully reinforced by the legislative history, which shows that the reference to particular persons was originally an essential feature of s 4D, and that the addition of the reference to classes was intended to expand it, not to make it superfluous. 
 
 [footnotes omitted]

The relevant facts of Rural Press were that senior officers of two companies publishing country newspapers agreed that one company, which had extended its circulation and advertising into the other's traditional catchment area, would withdraw from that area in exchange for the second company not, itself, extending its coverage into the first company's traditional area. There was found to be sufficient particularity of purpose for the engagement of s 4D. The persons who were deprived of the opportunity of acquisition of services from the first company were readers and advertisers in the Mannum area of South Australia. What follows should be read with the recognition that there was a tolerably clear geographical boundary within which one found the readers and advertisers in question. Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J said at [67]: 
 The Full Federal Court's reasoning concentrates too narrowly on the purpose of preventing Waikerie Printing selling papers to readers and space to advertisers, and not enough on the correlative -- the purpose of preventing readers buying papers and advertisers buying space from Waikerie Printing. The relationship between a buyer and a seller is not merely symbiotic. The link is inextricable. A supply by sale is an acquisition by purchase. There cannot be a seller without a buyer. There cannot be a supplier without an acquirer. There cannot be supply without acquisition. If one's purpose is to prevent the supply of services, an inevitable part of that purpose is to prevent the acquisition of those services by the person or persons to be supplied. Thus when the Full Federal Court accepted the trial judge's finding that the purpose of Rural Press and Bridge was to maintain their market power in Murray Bridge by preserving absence of competition in that market, it was accepting that their purpose was to maintain their market power in Murray Bridge by ensuring that the Standard would be the only paper and that readers and advertisers would not enjoy the services of the River News . The purpose of maintaining market power was indistinguishable from the purpose of preventing supply of certain services to, and acquisition of those services by, readers and advertisers. Acquisition of those services by readers and advertisers from the River News was inconsistent with the prevention of supply by the River News . It was not possible for the Rural Press parties consistently to say both that they had a purpose of preventing the River News from supplying services to readers and advertisers and also that they did not have a purpose of preventing readers and advertisers from acquiring services from the River News . "You could not have one without the other, however much you protested that you did not really want the other."

This can be said to permit the identification of the particular persons or classes of person by reference to the operation of the provision. As Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J show in footnote 132 in Rural Press (HC), whilst Callinan J in Souths expressed opposition to such an operation of s 4D, Gummow J, with whom McHugh J agreed, did not, and, indeed cited this passage in Souths . Neither Gleeson CJ nor Kirby J in Souths referred to the passage in question from Pont Data .

It can be seen from the judgment of Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J as well as that of Gleeson CJ and Callinan J that there was a sufficient degree of particularity in Rural Press (HC) for the operation of s 4D. It was not a particularity derived from an a priori process of reasoning or definition. It was founded on a distinct geographical area and, to some degree, the ability to identify people within that locality who fitted the description of readers of, or advertisers in, a newspaper that had been, and was otherwise intended to be, sold in that locality.

It is now clear from the High Court's decision in Souths that the purpose referred to in s 4D (notwithstanding that it is the purpose of the provision ) is a subjective purpose requiring an examination of the subjective purposes of the parties to the relevant contract, arrangement or understanding.</text>

<tocase>Sampi v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 777</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/777.html</AustLII>
<text>The recognition of the place of expert economic assistance in the manner described by Professor Brunt means that often the point of the expert opinion is to give a form or construct to the facts. It may appear to be an argument put by the witness. So it is. The discourse is not connected with the ascertainment of an identifiable truth in which task the Court is to be helped by the views of the expert in a specialised field. It is not, for example, the process of ascertaining the nature of a chemical reaction or the existence of conditions suitable for combustion. The view or argument as to the proper way to analyse facts in the world from the perspective of a social science is essentially argumentative. That does not mean intellectual rigour, honesty and a willingness to engage in discourse are not required. But it does mean that it may be an empty or meaningless statement to say that an expert should be criticised in this field for "putting an argument" as opposed to "giving an opinion". In this respect, regard should be had to the comments of French J in Sampi v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 at [792] - [793] where his Honour said in dealing with the anthropological evidence in native title cases: 
 Aspects of the reports offered what might properly be called argumentative or taxonomical conclusions or inferences relevant to the claimed determination of native title. To call them such is not necessarily to denigrate them. The judgment of the Court in determining the application is in part evaluative. The Federal Court Rules recognise that there are aspects of so called expert testimony which are argumentative and can be treated as submission. Order 10 r 1(2)(j) provides: 
 
'Without prejudice to the generality of sub-rule (1) or (1A) the Court may 
 

 
...
 

 
(j) in proceedings in which a party seeks to rely on the opinion of a person involving a subject in which the person has specialist qualifications, direct that all or part of such opinion be received by way of submission in such manner and form as the Court may think fit, whether or not the opinion would be admissible as evidence.'
 

 
 The rule of court was developed in part to respond to concerns about the way in which rules of evidence might lead to the exclusion of helpful economic testimony in competition law cases. Economic experts typically offer opinions about questions such as market definition relevant to the application of particular provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Such opinion is by way of characterisation of primary evidence and is essentially argumentative in character albeit the characterisation is informed by relevant expertise. An anthropologist, as in the present case, may offer an opinion on whether a particular group of people constitute a distinct or discrete society of persons. The nature of the taxonomical exercise is conceptually similar to that undertaken by the economist. 
 

 
 There is potentially some tension between the recognition that expert testimony may have the character of submission and the Practice Direction relating to expert witnesses which contemplates acceptance by the expert of a duty to the court in providing opinion evidence and which rejects the proposition that the expert is simply a 'hired gun' for the party who calls him or her. That tension and associated difficulty in the way of accepting expert testimony as evidence can arise where the opinion offered becomes advocacy for a particular outcome.

For the above reasons, I conclude that the Commission is entitled to relief arising from contraventions of the Act by Woolworths of s 45(2)(a)(i) and (b)(i) in respect of the Ettamogah and Global Beer episodes and of s 45(2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) in respect of all four episodes. It is appropriate to require the Commission to formulate the orders it seeks to reflect my reasons. Prima facie , it would appear to me that the Commission is entitled to declarations of contravention. Whether injunctive relief is appropriate, in the light of the changes to the Liquor Act , may be debatable. The question of penalty also arises. The parties will need to give some attention to a regime for any further evidence (and whether that is appropriate) and a hearing on that issue. An appropriately framed order under Order 29 of the Federal Court Rules should be considered. The question of the timing of the penalty hearing should be addressed by the parties. Subject to argument, I would not be in favour of delaying that until the outcome of any appeal.

I will leave these orders to be addressed by the parties and the matter can be discussed on a later occasion. Some orders, do however, need to be made now. I will mark Exhibit AA4 and Administrative Exhibit A14 and make the rulings in relation to Administrative Exhibits A13 and A14 that I have indicated. Also, a significant body of evidence, mainly documentary evidence, was admitted subject to an order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 based on commercial confidentiality. I do not propose to vary those orders unless requested to do so. However, if any person, whether Woolworths or Liquorland, or anyone else, seeks to have any part of my reasons not made available to the public, that person will have to persuade me, with evidence, that the administration of justice requires that course, in circumstances where the relevant evidence remains the subject of a s 50 order. To preserve the positions, I will limit, until further order, the publication of some of my reasons on market definition. One paragraph [728] will be distilled from Woolworths and Liquorland material. I will make it confidential to both parties. It appears to be benign, but if I should further disaggregate it, I should be told by Woolworths and Liquorland.</text>

Put another way, the purpose of Woolworths in behaving in a particular manner may be relevant in the conclusion about the market. Though the field of activity here was common ground (the sale of packaged takeaway liquor for off-premises consumption) the following passage from Neale The Antitrust Laws of the United States of America (2 nd Ed, 1970) at 21, quoted in Heydon JD, Trade Practices Law (Law Book Co Subscription Service) at [3.245] and cited in Singapore Airlines at 178, is relevant (though by no means determinative): 
 The court will take as the market, for the purposes of deciding cases, just that market which the firm itself takes for its field of activity: if a firm shows an intent to exclude competition from that field it will be assumed that the field sufficiently describes a market for otherwise what would be the point of the effort to exclude?

If, in the real commercial world, the firm in question takes the trouble to be concerned about restricting a new entrant's capacity, because of the potential effect on the sales and profits of its nearby local outlets (and not because of any concern about the potential effect on sales and profits of other, more widely situated, outlets), that may assist in a conclusion as to the importance of the closeness of competition and the concern as to additional constraints in that local area. The reality of the concern of the firm in question may assist in the illumination of the correct framework to analyse that conduct: cf Rural Press (HC) at 45. Woolworths submitted that whilst the purposive approach requires the relevant market to be defined by reference to the conduct sought to be impugned, the alleged purpose is not a relevant consideration in determining the market in which that purpose is to be assessed. I do not accept that submission. The impugned purpose in connection with the provisions of the relevant deed is the conduct to be assessed. The very fact that the firm behaved with that purpose may tell one something of the market. Further, it is the market analysis or tool best adapted to consider that conduct which is to be chosen.

It is appropriate at this point to set out the principles of market definition that appear to be agreed between the experts. Whilst, of course, the views of Dr Walker and Dr Smith in this regard are not determinative or binding on me, the agreement of two such experienced and learned economists is highly persuasive. the common ground between Dr Walker and Dr Smith</text>

<text>The content of the word "substantially" in s 45(2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) has been discussed in a number of cases, to some of which I referred at [86]-[89] above. It is clear that "substantially" is used in the sense of meaningful or relevant to the competitive process, and that it is necessary that the purpose be to achieve an effect of that kind. The discussion in Rural Press (HC) at [41] footnote 67 may indicate that there is a layer of meaning of "considerable" to be added to the notion of being meaningful or relevant to the competitive process. However, it is difficult to understand what purpose of the Act would be advanced by a conclusion that the purpose or effect of a provision was to lessen, prevent or hinder the competitive process, in a way which was meaningful and relevant to the competitive process, but was not sufficiently "considerable" to warrant relief. Once one recognises that the purpose must be to do something meaningful or relevant to the competitive process, adjectives, adverbs or like phrases connoting quantity, such as "considerable", "more than nominal", "more than insignificant", can be seen to be subsumed in the evaluative and functional analysis in deciding whether a purpose or conduct was of a character deserving of the intervention of the Court, in the light of the purposes of the Act, as being meaningful or relevant to the competitive process. I am not able, with respect, to express the matter more clearly than French J did in Stirling Harbour Services Pty Ltd v Bunbury Port Authority (2000) ATPR 41-752 at [114]: 
 The concept of "substantially lessening" competition is evaluative. There is only limited assistance to be derived from replacing the words with other phrases. The term is not defined in the Act and has not received extensive judicial exposition Eastern Express Pty Ltd v General Newspapers Pty Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-128 at 52,905 (Wilcox J); Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Stereo FM Pty Ltd (1982) 44 ALR 557 at 564 (Lockhart J); Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348, the latter on the meaning of "substantial" in the collocation "substantial loss or damage" under the old s 45D. In my opinion the phrase sets a standard for judicial intervention in respect of the classes of anti competitive conduct to which it applies. It requires, before that intervention can be invoked, that there be a purpose, effect or likely effect of the impugned conduct on competition which is substantial in the sense of meaningful or relevant to the competitive process. There is, of course, a certain circularity in these attempts at exposition. It could be said that a substantial lessening of competition describes a purpose or outcome of conduct which is deserving of the intervention of the Court in the protection of the competitive process according to law. So to say, is to identify the functional character of the statutory standard.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/193.html</AustLII>
<text>The Commission stressed the difference between purpose and effect and submitted that a person may have the relevant purpose even if the effect cannot be achieved: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 193 ; (2003) 131 FCR 529 at [249] . Here, it was said that the direct evidence of the Woolworths witnesses, Mr Meagher and Mr Smith, make out this part of the case (together with the relevant market analysis). Part of that submission, as will be clear when I deal with the evidence, was the submission that the purpose of filing the objection cannot be divorced from the purpose of the relevant provisions in the contracts.

Woolworths emphasised the substantive nature of the required purpose substantially to lessen competition, and distinguished this from intentional harm to competitors or protection of its own business: cf Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 and Universal Music at 591.

Leaving aside the submissions on the market, to which I will come, Woolworths submitted that there had been an inadequate foundation in cross-examination of Messrs Meagher and Smith and that it was not open to conclude on the evidence that either had the relevant purpose in respect of the relevant provisions or in respect of the giving effect to the relevant provisions. It was submitted that the cross-examiner did not squarely put relevant issues to Mr Smith and Mr Meagher, in particular the purposes of any provision in the deeds to prevent, limit or restrict supply of the sale of liquor to any persons, whether they be actual or potential customers of Woolworths or of any other liquor seller and to substantially lessen competition in the relevant market. I disagree. Mr Yates cross-examined Mr Smith and Mr Meagher fairly about what their intentions and purposes were in the transactions. Cross-examination took place in the language of human discourse. It was not necessary, although it could have been done, to put the exact words of the Act. It is for the Court to characterise the purpose from the evidence given. See generally Rural Press (HC) at [48] and Rural Press (FC) at [163].

The Ettamogah group of companies operated what were referred to as "themed" hotels and restaurants using the work of a cartoonist and artist, Mr Ken Maynard. The group had a number of licensed premises in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. Mr Leigh O'Brien was the controller of the group and of the relevant company concerned with the relevant events (Ettamogah Pub (Campbelltown) Pty Ltd). He was an experienced and competent businessman, who had undertaken objections under the Liquor Act to the licence applications of others in connection with one or more of the group's licensed establishments.
