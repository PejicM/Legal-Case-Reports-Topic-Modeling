<tocase>Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400</tocase>
<text>9 I discussed break fees and other "deal protection" measures, notably "no shop" or exclusivity period provisions, in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25] [55] and to a lesser extent in Re Investa Properties Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] [35], and will not repeat what I said in those cases. Generally, a break fee is a fee payable by the target company to the acquiring company in certain circumstances in which the acquisition is not implemented. Such provisions form part of a merger implementation agreement to which the directors of the target company commit their company prior to a scheme of arrangement being considered by the target company's shareholders. When deciding whether to order that a meeting be convened or that a scheme be approved, the Court is not in a position to decide whether a merger implementation agreement was entered into in breach of the duties owed by the target company's directors. The Court could do so only on a contested hearing in which it is alleged, and sought to be proved, that by committing the target company to the merger implementation agreement, the directors breached their statutory and general law duties: see eg, Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Limited [2007] FCA 1832.

16 The United Kingdom, like Australia, has legislative provision for judicial approval of schemes of arrangement: Companies Act 2006 (UK) c 46, Pt 26 (ss 895 901). There, as here, there is also a specialist takeover panel (the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers) and an associated administrative document containing guidance as to an acceptable level of break fee in the context of takeovers: The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (8 th ed, Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, 2006) and the Panel's Practice Statement No 4, r 21.2 regarding inducement fees, the effect of which I summarised in APN 62 ACSR 400 at [46].

17 The researches of Bolnisi's counsel did not elicit anything of specific relevance to naked no vote break fee provisions from the United Kingdom.

18 In New Zealand, Part XV of the Companies Act 1993 (NZ) (ss 235 239) also provides for judicial approval of schemes of arrangement. However, solicitors for Bolnisi informed the Court that Bolnisi's New Zealand counsel advised that the Takeovers Panel in New Zealand had not had to consider the issue of naked no vote break fees, or break fees more generally.</text>

<tocase>Re Ausdoc Group Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 629</tocase>
<text>13 Two decisions of the Takeovers Panel are relevant. In Re Ausdoc Group Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 629 a break fee was payable, inter alia, where a 90 percent minimum acceptance condition of a takeover offer was not satisfied. The Panel found the break fee provision to be unacceptable and accepted undertakings by the bidder and the target company not to enforce the provision or to pay the fee, respectively. The Panel stated (at [44]) that: "In assessing the potential for the 90% break fee to influence the decision of Ausdoc shareholders, we had regard to the fact that ... [t]he 90% break fee represents approximately 42% of [that year's] expected profit figure". The Panel had regard to the fact that payment of the break fee would mean that shareholders would not be paid a dividend for the year. The Panel accepted ASIC's submission that the break fee provision was coercive, that naked no vote break fees are to be distinguished from others, and that in the particular circumstances of the case, only a de minimis naked no vote break fee could be supported.

15 For the purposes of assessing a particular break fee, I see no distinction between the 90 percent minimum acceptance condition in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd 42 ACSR 629 and the minimum voting percentages referred to in s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Act. The approach taken by the Panel in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd 42 ACSR 629 may have been influenced by the size of the break fee in question. Be this as it may, the view expressed in Re National Can Industries (No 1) is inconsistent with any notion that a naked no vote break fee can only be supported if it is de minimis .

<tocase>Brazen v Bell Atlantic Corp 695 A2d 43 (Del Supr 1997)</tocase>
<text>11 In Brazen v Bell Atlantic Corp 695 A2d 43 (Del Supr 1997) ( Brazen v Bell ) the Supreme Court of Delaware made (at 49 50) the following observations that are pertinent to this question (the case concerned a stock for stock merger of equals, with reciprocal identical break fees):
 
 Plaintiff further argues that the termination fee provision was coercive. Plaintiff contends that (a) the stockholders never had an option to consider the merger agreement without the fee, and (b) regardless of what the stockholders thought of the merits of the transaction, the stockholders knew that if they voted against the transaction, they might well be imposing a $550 million penalty on their company. Plaintiff contends that the termination fee was so enormous that it "influenced" the vote. Finally, plaintiff argues that the fee provision was meant to be coercive because the drafters deliberately crafted the termination fees to make them applicable when Bell Atlantic's stockholders decline to approve the transaction as opposed to a termination resulting from causes other than the non-approval of the Bell Atlantic stockholders. We find plaintiff's arguments unpersuasive.
 
 First, the Court of Chancery properly found that the termination fee was not egregiously large. Second, the mere fact that the stockholders knew that voting to disapprove the merger may result in activation of the termination fee does not by itself constitute stockholder coercion. Third, we find no authority to support plaintiff's proposition that a fee is coercive because it can be triggered upon stockholder disapproval of the merger agreement, but not upon the occurrence of other events resulting in termination of the agreement.
 
 In Williams v Geier , this Court enunciated the test for stockholder coercion. Wrongful coercion that nullifies a stockholder vote may exist "where the board or some other party takes actions which have the effect of causing the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposed transaction for some reason other than the merits of that transaction [ Williams v Geier 671 A.2d 1368 (Del Supr 1996), 1382-83]. But we also stated in Williams v Geier that "[i]n the final analysis ... the determination of whether a particular stockholder vote has been robbed of its effectiveness by impermissible coercion depends on the facts of the case" [ Id at 1383].

26 I referred at [11] above to Brazen v Bell in which a nearly naked no vote break fee was upheld by the Supreme Court of Delaware. The fee was US$200 million (less than one percent of the corporation's market capitalisation). I say "nearly", because another condition was that there must have been in existence a competing proposal, even though it was rejected or withdrawn. If the competing proposal came to fruition within one and a half years, however, an additional US$350 million was payable (the total of US$550 million was approximately 2 percent of the target's approximately US$28 billion market capitalisation).

27 A complicating factor was that the Supreme Court of Delaware tested the fee against a liquidated damages measure rather than the business judgment rule, because the agreement's provision had the effect of specifically requiring the application of that measure. The Supreme Court of Delaware held the fee of US$550 million to be in the nature of liquidated damages, not a penalty, because it was "within the range of reasonableness" (at 49).</text>

<tocase>CW Shareholdings Inc v WIC Western International Communications Ltd (1998) 38 BLR (2d) 196</tocase>
<text>30 As in the US, judicial consideration of break fees by Canadian courts often occurs in the context of contested litigation. Canadian courts have upheld break fees generally: see CW Shareholdings Inc v WIC Western International Communications Ltd (1998) 38 BLR (2d) 196. I was informed that counsel for Bolnisi's Canadian subsidiary company, Palmarejo, conducted a survey of plans of arrangement undertaken in Canada in 2007 and found that many included a naked no vote break fee.
 The evidence before the Court relevant to the naked no vote break fee in the present case

31 Bolnisi relies on the following three affidavits. The first is an affidavit of Norman Alfred Seckold, Chairman and a Director of Bolnisi, sworn 25 October 2007, paras 22 27 of which were set out in my earlier reasons for judgment (at [25]) and are summarised at [39] below.

32 The second affidavit is a further affidavit of Mr Seckold sworn 13 November 2007 in which Mr Seckold states that the terms of the MIA were negotiated at meetings on 4 April 2007 and 2 May 2007, and that at one of those meetings a partner from Freehills, representing Coeur, told him that Coeur would not enter into a transaction with Bolnisi unless Bolnisi agreed to pay a break fee triggered by a failure of its shareholders to vote to agree to the proposed Scheme. Mr Seckold stated that he agreed subject, inter alia, to Coeur's agreeing to a reciprocal break fee provision, because without it, it would be open to Coeur shareholders to frustrate implementation of the Scheme by not passing the resolution to increase the number of the authorised shares in the capital of Coeur. Mr Seckold states that he took the view that without the provision for the Coeur break fee, the Coeur shareholders would have "a free option over the scheme".</text>

<text>28 In several cases, the Delaware Court of Chancery has made passing reference to naked no vote break fees without suggesting disapproval: see Emerson Radio Corp v International Jensen Inc 1996 WL 483086 (Del Ch 1996) at 9; Hills Stores Co v Bozic 769 A2d 88 (Del Ch 2000) at 104; and McMillan v Intercargo Corp 768 A2d 492 (Del Ch 2000) at 505. In HF Ahmanson &amp; Co v Great Western Financial Corp CA 15650 (Del Ch 1997) that Court upheld a 3 percent break fee notwithstanding that half of that break fee remained payable in the naked no vote situation. In Paramount Communications Inc v QVC Network Inc 637 A2d 34 (Del Supr 1993) a US$100 million break fee was payable, inter alia, in the naked no vote situation. However, the Supreme Court of Delaware held that, in the circumstances of that case, the break fee and the other lock-up arrangements were unreasonable and "draconian", and affirmed the decision of the Court of Chancery that the company's directors had breached their fiduciary duties.</text>

<tocase>Re National Can Industries (No 1) (2003) 48 ACSR 409</tocase>
<text>14 In Re National Can Industries (No 1) (2003) 48 ACSR 409 the Panel stated (at [42]) that it did "not entirely reject the notion that a fee should be payable if and when a proposal the directors have endorsed is rejected by shareholders", and that "[a]s GN7 put it, such a fee may be an appropriate price to secure an opportunity broadly in the nature of an option" [the reference to GN7 is a reference to the Panel's Guidance Note No 7: Lock-up Devices ]. Later, at [51], the Panel again referred to the naked no vote break fee as "in effect the price paid to secure the opportunity for shareholders to consider the proposal". The review Panel (at [33]) expressly agreed with the former statement by the original Panel.

15 For the purposes of assessing a particular break fee, I see no distinction between the 90 percent minimum acceptance condition in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd 42 ACSR 629 and the minimum voting percentages referred to in s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Act. The approach taken by the Panel in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd 42 ACSR 629 may have been influenced by the size of the break fee in question. Be this as it may, the view expressed in Re National Can Industries (No 1) is inconsistent with any notion that a naked no vote break fee can only be supported if it is de minimis .

<tocase>Revlon Inc v MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc 506 A2d 173 (Del 1986)</tocase>
<text>19 In the United States (US), there is no r&eacute;gime comparable to that of the United Kingdom or Australia. In the US questions of the legitimacy of break fees arise in litigated contests, notably in the Delaware Court of Chancery and, on appeal from it, the Supreme Court of Delaware. Consequently, break fees have been considered in Delaware in the factually rich matrix of (often disputed) evidence. In those cases, the plaintiff is often a competing bidder or an aggrieved stockholder who assumes the task of proving a breach of the target company's directors' fiduciary duty to obtain the highest price for the target's shareholders, and not to allow any conflict of interest or other factor to interfere with their doing so, as recognised in Revlon Inc v MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc 506 A2d 173 (Del Supr 1986).

20 This is a very different situation from that which prevails in applications under s 411 of the Act, even after allowance is made for performance of the plaintiff's duty to draw the Australian Court's attention to matters that might point against approval.

21 The Delaware cases have recognised the tension that potentially exists between "the business judgment rule" and the fiduciary duty of the directors. The business judgment rule cautions against the courts' substituting their opinion as to where the commercial interests of the corporation and its shareholders lie for the opinion of the directors.</text>

<tocase>In re Toys "R" Us Inc Shareholder Litigation 877 A2d 975 (Del Ch 2005)</tocase>
<text>22 So called "break fees" have worn different names, particularly in the US ("termination fees", "inducement fees", "cancellation fees"). The amount payable sometimes varies according to the circumstances in which it becomes payable, the amount being less in the naked no vote situation. For example, In re Toys "R" Us Inc Shareholder Litigation 877 A2d 975 (Del Ch 2005) ( Toys "R" Us ), the break fee in one offer was described as follows (at 996):
 
 The Company offered to pay the KKR Group [the acquiring company] 3% of the Company's equity value, as implied by the final deal terms. The payment of the 3% was, from what I can discern, to be made only when:
 
 
 
 1. the Company's board terminates the merger agreement to accept a higher bid or the KKR Group terminates because the board had withdrawn its recommendation of the merger;
 2. another offer to acquire the Company exists at the time the Company's stockholders vote on the merger, the Company's stockholders do not approve the merger agreement, and the Company consummates an alternative transaction within the next year; or
 3. another offer to acquire the Company exists at the time the merger agreement terminates automatically by having reached its termination date, September 15, 2005, and the Company consummates an alternative transaction within a year. 
 
 
 
 In the event that the merger agreement was terminated simply because the Company's stockholders voted it down, the Company offered only to reimburse the KKR Group for a to-be-negotiated sum approximating its documented, out-of-pocket expenses.

23 In Toys "R" Us, the target company "agreed to pay only up to US$30 million in documented expenses", less than half of a percent of the equity value of the company, upon the occurrence of a naked no vote (at 997). On the other hand, a full termination fee "payable for the most part only if the company terminated the merger agreement in order to sign up another acquisition proposal within a year" was US$247.5 million (3.75 percent of equity value and 3.25 percent of enterprise value) (at 997). Although the Court did not scrutinize the naked no vote fee in its opinion, it did observe (at 1023):
 
 [T]he bottom line is that the public stockholders will have an opportunity tomorrow to reject the merger if they do not think the price is high enough in light of the Company's stand-alone value and other options. If the stockholders vote no, the only price will be the payment of $30 million to KKR Group, which is likely less than its actual expenses to date.

24 It seems to follow that in Toys "R" Us the Court did not view the naked no vote break fee provision with disapproval.

25 In 2007, a Project Report of the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Market Trends Subcommittee of the Committee on Negotiated Acquisitions of the American Bar Association's Section of Business Law was released, entitled "2007 Strategic Buyer/Public Target Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deal Points Study". The study relates to transactions and acquisitions announced in 2005 and 2006. It found that nine percent of 2005 and 2006 acquisitions involved naked no vote break fees. The report also found that out of the 18 transactions that contained a naked no vote trigger, 17 required reimbursement of expenses only (as was the case in Toys "R" Us, for example), rather than the higher break fee payable in other contexts.</text>
