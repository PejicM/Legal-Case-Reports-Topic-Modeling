<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344</tocase>
<text>4 The test to be applied for an extension of time within which to appeal was discussed in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195, and, in a different legislative context, in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9. I refer also to Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133. In Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen , Wilcox J identified six relevant matters at 348-9. I have had regard to those matters. It must be said immediately the period of delay in this case is very short and, subject to what I am about to say, no injustice will be occasioned to the first respondent if an extension of time is granted. It is not easy to understand the applicant's explanation for the delay but in view of the language difficulties I am not prepared to say that his explanation is an unsatisfactory one. In those circumstances, it will often be appropriate to extend time. However, the matter which is fatal to the application is the fact that the applicant has been unable to identify any reasonable prospect of success in the appeal: Jeffers v The Queen [1993] HCA 11 ; (1993) 67 ALJR 288.</text>
