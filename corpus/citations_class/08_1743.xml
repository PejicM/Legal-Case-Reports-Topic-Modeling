<text>29 In any event, the Tribunal did consider independent information which indicated that, while there was some tension between black South Africans and foreigners in some areas of South Africa, there was no mention of events involving attacks on South African citizens of Indian ethnicity. The Tribunal's reliance on that material was a matter for the Tribunal and it was under no obligation to search for further country information to support the appellant's claims (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [20] citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [43] per Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) and at [124] per Callinan J, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 74 FCR 553 at 561, SBBA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 90 at [8] , SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 225 at [16] ).

30 The appellant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the Federal Magistrate or jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. He has not made out any of the matters set out in his grounds of appeal. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

<text>1 The appellant was born in India but is a citizen of South Africa. He arrived in Australia on 8 September 2007 and on 19 October 2007 he lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The application was refused by a delegate of the Minister. The delegate's decision to refuse the protection visa was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). An application for review of the decision of the Tribunal was dismissed by Scarlett FM ( SZMEZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1097).

2 The appellant appeals from the decision of Scarlett FM.

3 The appellant applied for an adjournment of this appeal for some months. He notified the first respondent's legal representatives of the application for adjournment on the morning of the hearing of the appeal. The application for adjournment was opposed.</text>
