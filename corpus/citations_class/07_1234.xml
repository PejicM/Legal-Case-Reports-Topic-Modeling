<tocase>Bidald Consulting v Miles Special Builders [2005] NSWSC 1235 ; (2005) 226 ALR 510</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/1235.html</AustLII>
<text>In my view, the power conferred on the Court by s 600B is an ample one which can be exercised by reference, not only to the interests of creditors, but also by reference to the public interest and commercial morality. A similar observation applies in relation to the power conferred on the Court by s 447A. Although Bidald Consulting v Miles Special Builders [2005] NSWSC 1235 ; (2005) 226 ALR 510 concerned an application to set aside under s 445D, I treat what Campbell J said in that case at [286] ff about the relevance of public interest considerations to the exercise of the Court's discretion as applicable, generally speaking, to the discretion under the two sections just mentioned. 3. The issue of termination of the DOCA and constitution of the Creditors' Fund

The Administrators contend that the DOCA terminated on 21 June 2006 when the Creditors' Fund was fully exhausted: see s 445C(c) of the Act and cl 14.1(a) of the DOCA. As already observed, s 445C provides that a DOCA terminates when the first of three events identified in the section occurs, one of the events being "(c) if the deed specifies circumstances in which it is to terminate those circumstances exist". Clause 14.1(a) of the DOCA specified that the DOCA was to terminate "on the completion of the distribution of the whole Creditors' Fund in accordance with [the DOCA]".

The Administrators say that the termination has two relevant effects. The first is that since the DOCA had no further scope for operation after 21 June 2006, from that time the Court lacked power to terminate it. I agree that if the DOCA terminated at that time, by the operation of s 445C(c) and cl 14.1(a), the Court no longer has power to terminate the DOCA under s 445D. The first reason is the general consideration that it would not be possible to terminate a DOCA that had already terminated. Second, s 445C makes it clear that a DOCA terminates when any one of the three events specified in the section first occurs, and one of those events is the making of an order under s 445D terminating the DOCA (para (a)), while another is that the DOCA specifies circumstances in which it is to terminate and those circumstances exist (para (c)). They are alternatives: if a DOCA terminates by reason of the operation of s 445C(c) and the existence of the circumstances specified in the DOCA as those in which it is to terminate, it is no longer possible for the Court to terminate it under s 445D.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2006/245.html</AustLII>
<text>The question of the considerations that are relevant to a company administrator's exercise of a casting vote under reg 5.6.21 and of applications under s 600B to set aside a resolution passed on the casting vote has been considered in Re Bartlett Researched Securities Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1994) 12 ACSR 707 ( Bartlett ), Re Coaleen Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1999) 30 ACSR 200 ( Coaleen ), Re Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ACSR 487 , Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd (2001) 37 ACSR 394 ( Cresvale ), Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; (2002) 170 FLR 86 , and Blue Ring Pty Ltd v Landshore Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2006] WASC 245 ( Blue Ring ).

These authorities show that: 
(1) Good faith alone will not necessarily shield the resolution from a setting aside (or variation) under s 600B ( Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [111]);
 
(2) A factor that may justify setting aside the resolution is a statement in or omission from the administrator's report under s 439A that is apt to have misled creditors when they cast their deliberative vote ( Blue Ring [2006] WASC 245) ;
 
(3) Inadequacy and superficiality of an administrator's investigation of the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances, at least as disclosed by the evidence before the Court, may warrant a setting aside of the resolution ( Bartlett 12 ACSR 707 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [113]);
 
(4) There is no presumption in favour of the majority in value, although any large disproportion between the values of the debts of the numerical minority and the numerical majority will be a factor to be taken into account ( Coaleen 30 ACSR 200 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [115]); and
 
(5) Payment of a premium to the creditors who supported the DOCA but not to a dissident creditor will justify a setting aside by the court ( Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; 170 FLR 86).</text>

<text>Similarly, in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v PDDAM Pty Ltd (1996) 19 ACSR 498 , Heerey J observed that the Harmer Report and the Explanatory Memorandum referred to above, indicated that the investigation was to be "a swift and practical one" (at 510). His Honour observed that Pt 5.3A assumed that the company was either trading while insolvent or was likely to be trading while insolvent within a predictable period of time, citing s 436A(1)(a). His Honour considered that it was self-evidently essential that such a state of affairs be brought to an end promptly, either by the execution of a DOCA or by a winding up. Heerey J observed (at 510) that "[t]he tight timeframes set for the convening of the first and second meetings of creditors are consistent with that need".</text>

<text>In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Portinex Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 99 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 391 ( Portinex ), Austin J noted (at [125]) that it was "an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of the scheme established by Pt 5.3A that the creditors must make their decision on the basis of information that is likely to be imperfect". After referring to Hagenvale 17 ACSR 139 , his Honour stated (at [126] [127]): 
 
 [126] The balance between speed and accuracy is a delicate one. An administrator who accepts the company's information uncritically and without exercising judgment, cutting corners to complete the administration and receive his fee, will be treated harshly by the court, since the whole scheme of Pt 5.3A depends on the independence, competence, professionalism and hard work of the insolvency practitioners who accept appointments as voluntary administrators. 
 

 
 
 [127] The distinction between an adequate preliminary investigation, leading to the conclusion that there are grounds for suspecting insolvent trading and unfair preferences but going no further, and an inadequate preliminary investigation which fails to assemble available information with respect to insolvent trading and unfair preferences, is a matter of degree. If the administrator has conducted an adequate preliminary investigation in accordance with the principles in the Hagenvale case, his obligation is to bring the results of the investigation to creditors so that they can decide what is to be done next. If the administrator's preliminary investigation has been adequate, he is entitled to decline to embark upon further substantial investigations unless funds are made available to cover his fees and expenses of doing so.

As I think Austin J implied in Portinex [2000] NSWSC 99 ; 34 ACSR 391 , it must often be a difficult question for company administrators how far to go in their investigations and report. An administrator does not have the powers of a liquidator, and I do not understand Gillard J in Rugs Galore [1999] VSC 126 to have suggested that an administrator should be held to standards applicable to a liquidator. Much will depend on what comes to the administrator's notice in the course of his or her investigations, and how much will come to notice will be influenced by, among other considerations, the fact that he or she is not expected to conduct a moral crusade (see [210] ff below). It will often be appropriate, as Mr Hamilton did, to draw the creditors' attention to lines of inquiry that it would be open to a liquidator to pursue, to the likely cost of pursuing them, to the need for funding, and to the issue whether the prospective defendant would have the means to satisfy a judgment.</text>

<tocase>Hagenvale Pty Ltd v Depela Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 139</tocase>
<text>In Hagenvale Pty Ltd v Depela Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 139 ( Hagenvale ), Cohen J stated in relation to Pt 5.3A (at 145 146 ): 
 
 ... an administrator, constrained as he or she is by the time limits imposed under the Part, cannot carry out a detailed investigation of a company in the same way as can a liquidator, and accordingly the administrator's actions must be looked at in the light of that more restricted range of activities which are available to him [or her]. A further result, when dealing with a deed of company arrangement under Pt 5.3A , is that the amount of detailed information which would be given to creditors in a scheme of arrangement under s 411 of the Corporations Law is not available, again because of time restrictions and the need to have material sent to the creditors quickly.

In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Portinex Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 99 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 391 ( Portinex ), Austin J noted (at [125]) that it was "an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of the scheme established by Pt 5.3A that the creditors must make their decision on the basis of information that is likely to be imperfect".

<tocase>Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/608.html</AustLII>
<text>In his submissions, Mr Hamilton explains why repaying part of its debt to Wyreach by funding the Parkwind DOCA was not necessarily "uncommercial". Whether there was a voidable unfair preference given by Wellnora to Wyreach would depend on whether Wellnora was insolvent at the time of the transaction (at 6 December 2004 or 11 January 2005). Consideration of that question would require consideration of the matters mentioned by Palmer J in Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385. It would require a detailed and thorough investigation of the relationship and financial arrangements as between Wellnora and other companies within the Wyreach sub-group. Mr Hamilton was not in a position as company administrator to pursue those inquiries.

Predictably, the DCT submits that this shows why a winding up and the appointment of a liquidator are desirable. However, in his Supplementary Report Mr Hamilton emphasised the need for funding to be provided to a liquidator and also the fact that it was unclear what assets would be available to satisfy a successful recovery action by a liquidator. Notwithstanding the specific mention of the need for a liquidator to be funded, Ms Kelly did not at the second meeting of creditors on 14 February 2006 say that the DCT was or even might be prepared to fund a recovery action.

I accept the following submissions of the Administrators (paras 3.18, 3.19): 
 
 3.18 In summary, the evidence [of] Hamilton concerning this transaction, showed that he reported the following to creditors in the first report:
 (i) The Wyreach ledger needed further investigation: ... 
 (ii) The Parkwind Transaction may constitute a loan or a preference: ... 
 (iii) There is a question as to whether Parkwind has any assets: ... (iv) The full facts need to be established and further investigation carried out, the ability to recover the amounts, the legal fees involved and whether a public examination is justified and at what cost: ... 
 (v) Liquidator would need to be fully indemnified: ... 
 (vi) At the end of the day preferences are notoriously difficult to sustain: ... 
 (vii) The good faith defence of the recipient of the fund Parkwind;
 (viii) The problems of related party funding and understandings. 
 

 
 
 3.19 In the Supplementary Report his analysis above was expanded, including as follows ... 
 (i) A ledger adjustment in Wellnora's books shows a reduction in the intercompany debt owed by Wellnora to Wyreach for the $300,000 Wellnora paid to Parkwind;
 (ii) Hamilton obtained relevant documents surrounding the circumstances of the Parkwind DOCA and the payment by Wellnora, from its administrator G Woodgate;
 (iii) Books of a company are prima facie evidence of matters they record, so it might be inferred that Wyreach was a party to the transaction;
 (iv) The timings of the transaction need to be investigated;
 (v) The whole group of companies may need to be analysed to prove whether there was insolvency at a particular time;
 (vi) Creditor funding would be needed for the examination of directors;
 (vii) Even if a claim was successful, the recovery potential is unknown.</text>

<text>In R v Bradford Metropolitan City Council; ex parte Corris [1989] 3 All ER 156 at 160 Neill LJ said: 
 
 A person who has a second or casting vote is clearly under a duty to exercise it honestly and in accordance with what he believes to be the best interests of those who may be affected by the vote. Subject to this, however, it seems to me that the person presiding at a meeting is fully entitled to use his vote as he thinks fit. 
 

 
According to this passage, Mr Hamilton was required to exercise his casting vote honestly and in accordance with what he believed to be the best interests of the creditors. He did so.

Unlike her colleague, Leisa Kelly, who seems to have thought that Mr Hamilton was committed to favouring the DOCA, Ms Brennan disavowed any such view. She seems to have accepted that Mr Hamilton acted in good faith and without bias when he voted in the way he did. In any event, I find that he did.

Mr Hamilton had calculated that the DOCA would give creditors a marginally better return than a winding up would do. The dividend that the proposed DOCA promised was paltry, but it exceeded what creditors would receive on a winding up. Mr Hamilton considered the likelihood of recoveries by a liquidator and dealt with the matter in the Report and the Supplementary Report, concluding that the likelihood of a successful claim was so small as not to outweigh the tiny dividend offered by the proposed DOCA. On what basis should Mr Hamilton have exercised his casting vote to deny creditors the promised dividend, very small though it was?</text>

<text>The question of the considerations that are relevant to a company administrator's exercise of a casting vote under reg 5.6.21 and of applications under s 600B to set aside a resolution passed on the casting vote has been considered in Re Bartlett Researched Securities Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1994) 12 ACSR 707 ( Bartlett ), Re Coaleen Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1999) 30 ACSR 200 ( Coaleen ), Re Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ACSR 487 , Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd (2001) 37 ACSR 394 ( Cresvale ), Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; (2002) 170 FLR 86 , and Blue Ring Pty Ltd v Landshore Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2006] WASC 245 ( Blue Ring ).

These authorities show that: 
(1) Good faith alone will not necessarily shield the resolution from a setting aside (or variation) under s 600B ( Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [111]);
 
(2) A factor that may justify setting aside the resolution is a statement in or omission from the administrator's report under s 439A that is apt to have misled creditors when they cast their deliberative vote ( Blue Ring [2006] WASC 245) ;
 
(3) Inadequacy and superficiality of an administrator's investigation of the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances, at least as disclosed by the evidence before the Court, may warrant a setting aside of the resolution ( Bartlett 12 ACSR 707 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [113]);
 
(4) There is no presumption in favour of the majority in value, although any large disproportion between the values of the debts of the numerical minority and the numerical majority will be a factor to be taken into account ( Coaleen 30 ACSR 200 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [115]); and
 
(5) Payment of a premium to the creditors who supported the DOCA but not to a dissident creditor will justify a setting aside by the court ( Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; 170 FLR 86).

In Coaleen 30 ACSR 200 , the plaintiff accounted for 96.3 percent of the company's indebtedness. In the present case the DCT represented 55.84 percent of the total amount for which creditors were admitted to vote. If the amount truly owing to the DCT was only $681,990 as admitted by Ms Soong in the RATA, the percentage would be far below 50 percent. However, if the amounts truly owing to Mr Soong and the Soong companies were less than the amounts for which those claims were admitted for voting purposes, the DCT's debt could account for far more than 55.84 percent. I can only consider the position on the basis that the amount owing to the DCT was just over 50 percent a position vastly different from that in Coaleen 30 ACSR 200.

Mr Hamilton has given affidavit evidence in considerable detail of his course of reasoning and of the materials that led him to exercise the casting vote in the way in which he did. He treated all creditors equally; carried out a thorough investigation; indicated lines of inquiry that could be pursued by a liquidator; formed the view that recovery proceedings by a liquidator would face hurdles and might well be fruitless, even if nominally successful; and exercised his casting vote in favour of the marginally better return that the DOCA offered.

It is difficult to understand the basis on which his vote can be impugned unless it should be on the ground that Mr Hamilton did not properly inform himself with respect to (a) the Parkwind/Wyreach transaction, or (b) Wellnora's failure to pay GST to the DCT. I will now turn to these two matters. 8. The Parkwind/Wyreach transaction</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/1999/126.html</AustLII>
<text>The DCT has, however, rightly drawn attention to the note of caution sounded by Gillard J in Re Rugs Galore Australia Pty Ltd; Linen House Pty Ltd v Rugs Galore Australia Pty Ltd [1999] VSC 126 ( Rugs Galore ) at [75] [79]: 
 
 [75] The extent of the investigation is in the end a matter for the administrator. Hence the importance of his impartiality, independence and requirement to act carefully in the interests of the creditors. 
 

 
 
 [76] Whilst there are strict time limits and the administration is intended to proceed speedily there is no excuse for failing to carry out a full and proper investigation. What is a full and proper investigation will depend on all the circumstances but matters of concern to creditors are preferences, possible directors' breach of duty, possibility of recovering compensation from directors who conduct the company's business knowing it is insolvent, and recovery of compensation from de facto directors. Another matter of importance is the recovery of any of the corporation's property which has been unlawfully transferred. 
 

 
 
 [77] In my opinion it is no excuse to limit a full and careful investigation by reference to the time limits set out in the Law. Time limits require expedition, and a full investigation may require further resources being used and if necessary the second meeting be adjourned or an application for extension of time be made. Further resources would include the employment of enough personnel to adequately perform the task. The fact that the second meeting can be adjourned from time to time supports the view that the administrator should not refuse to investigate fully a matter because of time constraints. In the end result the creditors must know. They are entitled to a thorough investigation. They rely on the administrator performing his task. Failure to properly investigate puts at risk the whole object of Part 5.3A which ultimately leaves the decision to the creditors making an informed decision. If the administrator is unable to make a proper investigation in respect of matters of importance to the creditors' decision he should tell them. He should alert them that there are matters relevant to their interests which should be further investigated. Much can be gained by shareholders, directors and others from a deed of company arrangement "wiping the debts" and putting beyond the reach of the law the delinquencies of directors and others involved with the company's business. It behoves an administrator to properly fulfil his duty. 
 

 
 
 [78] There are dicta in the cases suggesting that the time limits imposed for the convening of the second meeting can affect the amount of information that should be provided to the creditors. An administrator should not take those observations as being an excuse for failing to properly, adequately and carefully investigate matters which are material to the decision of the creditors or failing to inform the creditors on material matters. 
 

 
 
 [79] The administrator has extensive powers and it is no excuse not to fully, carefully and adequately investigate a matter which would bear on the decision of the creditors. There is a tendency to assume that if any money is available to a creditor pursuant to a deed of company arrangement which is in excess of any amount that would be recovered on a liquidation, that is a proper basis for opining the view that company arrangement is the best alternative. Therefore there is no necessity to concern the creditors about other issues. The argument is the bottom line is money, and irrespective of how much, a receipt of something is better than nothing. But there are other factors which may influence creditors. They should have the benefit of a proper investigation.

As I think Austin J implied in Portinex [2000] NSWSC 99 ; 34 ACSR 391 , it must often be a difficult question for company administrators how far to go in their investigations and report. An administrator does not have the powers of a liquidator, and I do not understand Gillard J in Rugs Galore [1999] VSC 126 to have suggested that an administrator should be held to standards applicable to a liquidator. Much will depend on what comes to the administrator's notice in the course of his or her investigations, and how much will come to notice will be influenced by, among other considerations, the fact that he or she is not expected to conduct a moral crusade (see [210] ff below). It will often be appropriate, as Mr Hamilton did, to draw the creditors' attention to lines of inquiry that it would be open to a liquidator to pursue, to the likely cost of pursuing them, to the need for funding, and to the issue whether the prospective defendant would have the means to satisfy a judgment.</text>

<text>The question of the considerations that are relevant to a company administrator's exercise of a casting vote under reg 5.6.21 and of applications under s 600B to set aside a resolution passed on the casting vote has been considered in Re Bartlett Researched Securities Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1994) 12 ACSR 707 ( Bartlett ), Re Coaleen Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1999) 30 ACSR 200 ( Coaleen ), Re Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ACSR 487 , Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd (2001) 37 ACSR 394 ( Cresvale ), Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; (2002) 170 FLR 86 , and Blue Ring Pty Ltd v Landshore Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2006] WASC 245 ( Blue Ring ).

These authorities show that: 
(1) Good faith alone will not necessarily shield the resolution from a setting aside (or variation) under s 600B ( Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [111]);
 
(2) A factor that may justify setting aside the resolution is a statement in or omission from the administrator's report under s 439A that is apt to have misled creditors when they cast their deliberative vote ( Blue Ring [2006] WASC 245) ;
 
(3) Inadequacy and superficiality of an administrator's investigation of the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances, at least as disclosed by the evidence before the Court, may warrant a setting aside of the resolution ( Bartlett 12 ACSR 707 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [113]);
 
(4) There is no presumption in favour of the majority in value, although any large disproportion between the values of the debts of the numerical minority and the numerical majority will be a factor to be taken into account ( Coaleen 30 ACSR 200 ; Cresvale 37 ACSR 394 at [115]); and
 
(5) Payment of a premium to the creditors who supported the DOCA but not to a dissident creditor will justify a setting aside by the court ( Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; 170 FLR 86).</text>
