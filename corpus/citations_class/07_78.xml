<text>1 In this appeal, the Appellant contends that Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones erred ( SZDBZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 890) in dismissing on 12 July 2006 an Application for Review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 20 February 2004 and delivered on 11 March 2004 affirming a decision of the Minister's Delegate refusing the Appellant's application for a protection visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').

2 The Appellant's Notice of Appeal recites three grounds which fail to reveal the content or substance of the Appellant's contentions. Nevertheless, the grounds are these:
 
 
 '(a) The magistrate made [a] mistake in law in rejecting the Submissions made by my Lawyer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) The magistrate made [a] mistake in law in that the Tribunal had not decided my case correctly. 
 
 (c) The magistrate made [a] Jurisdictional mistake in law in not holding that I was denied procedural fairness and denied natural Justice.'

3 Mr J M Patel of counsel prepared written submissions on behalf of the Appellant in support of the proceedings before Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones and the Appellant relied upon those written submissions in support of the grounds of appeal before this Court. In those submissions Mr Patel addresses three grounds of appeal. The first ground is that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in failing to properly construe and apply a correct understanding of the notion of 'persecution' and the elements of a 'well-founded fear' of persecution for the purposes of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees ('the Convention') as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees ('the Refugees Protocol') for the purposes of s 65(1) of the Act.</text>

<text>22 The statutory obligation of the Tribunal upon a reconsideration is to assess the scope and content of the Appellant's claims to determine, on all the material properly before the Tribunal, whether the Tribunal can be affirmatively satisfied that the Appellant holds a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Notwithstanding that the Tribunal constituted by a Tribunal member other than Mrs Nicholls previously accepted aspects of the version of events asserted by the Appellant, Mrs Nicholls was obliged to discharge the statutory jurisdiction by examining the claims and reaching or failing to reach, the required degree of satisfaction. If not satisfied of the relevant matters, Mrs Nicholls was bound to 'refuse to grant the visa' (s 65(1)(b)) of the Act). In so approaching the matter, the Tribunal acted correctly and within jurisdiction and in a manner consistent with the observations of their Honours in SJSB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 255 at [15] , per Ryan, Jacobson and Lander JJ; Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [17] , per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ and Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.</text>
