<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<text>I turn to the second proceeding and the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. It is a well accepted principle that it is not open to me to grant an interlocutory injunction in the air in the absence of a cause of action to be adjudicated upon at trial. It was made clear in Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 that an interlocutory injunction should only be granted by a court in support of a known cause of action upon which the applicant for the interlocutory injunction wishes to rely at trial.

The applicants relied upon the following causes of action: 
(a) The proposal by the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases constitutes oppressive conduct and conduct not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole giving rise to causes of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. The 40 year sub-leases were not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole because the Associations were giving away their control of the management of the tenancies of the individual residents to the Commonwealth which was outside the objectives of each Housing Association. This control was being given away for $1 per year and there was no guarantee by the Minister that any part of the proposed expenditure of $100 million in respect of the town camps would be allocated to any particular or specific Housing Association. It was further submitted that the 40 year sub-leases did not protect the current rights of occupancy of the tenants under their tenancy agreements;
 
(b) The constitutions of the Housing Associations constituted contracts with their members and the entry of the Housing Associations into the sub-leases would be contrary to the objectives of the Housing Associations and would therefore constitute a breach of their constitutions which the Minister was inducing;
 
(c) The decision to enter into the 40 year sub-leases was ultra vires the Housing Associations;
 
(d) The management committee of each Housing Association was in breach of the fiduciary duty they owed to the Association and its members by agreeing to enter into the sub-leases.
 
(e) The entry by the Housing Associations into the sub-leases constituted a breach of contract as the sub-leases would constitute a breach of the individual tenancy agreements of the tenants of the Housing Associations;
 
(f) The Minister was engaging in the tort of intimidation by unlawful means in that she was intimidating the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases when she had not accorded procedural fairness to the individual tenants;
 
(g) Section 20CA of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act had not been complied with as the Housing Associations were required to make a request to the Minister to enter into the sub-leases but that request had to be voluntary. The requests made by the Housing Associations were not voluntary.

In the circumstances as they developed in the course of the hearing I do not consider that it is necessary to reach a conclusion whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to each of the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that if they now enter into the sub-leases the Housing Associations will not be acting in the interests of their members as a whole thereby giving rise to a cause of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. Under their Constitutions the only way a person can become a member of the relevant Housing Association is if that person is a resident of the town camp which is situated on the land which is comprised in the perpetual lease or Crown Lease held by the Association.</text>

<tocase>Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148</tocase>
<text>It is important to recognise that at this stage of both proceedings, as I am dealing with applications for interlocutory relief, I do not have to make any final determination in respect of the issues raised before the Court. Consistently with established authority I am required to determine whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the causes of action raised by the applicants in each proceeding. If I am so satisfied and am satisfied that the applicants will suffer irreparable harm in respect of which damages are not an adequate remedy if an injunction is not granted, it is then necessary to determine whether the balance of convenience favours the grant or refusal of the injunctive relief sought. I am therefore following and applying the process identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153: 
 "In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction." 

 Consideration of the first proceeding

In relation to the first proceeding the applicants submitted that a breach of the rules of natural justice has occurred or is occurring or is likely to occur in connection with the proposal of the Minister to give the notice pursuant to s 47(1) of the NER Act. The tenants of the Housing Associations will be significantly affected by the proposed decision so that the Minister is obliged to observe the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness and ensure that the tenants are made aware of the manner in which their rights will be affected by the notice and are given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister as to whether or not she should give a notice before she finally makes a decision.

The applicants submitted that the power conferred on the Minister by s 47 of the NER Act to issue a notice which had the effect of vesting all rights and interests in the land to which the notice related with the Commonwealth (see s 47(3)), was subject to a duty imposed upon the Minister to accord procedural fairness or natural justice to the applicants. It was submitted that that duty had not been observed in the present circumstances as the tenants had not been made fully aware of the consequence of the notice on their rights to occupy the land which they sub-leased from the Housing Associations and that they had not been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister in respect of her proposal to give such a notice.

The Minister submitted that the power given to the Minister pursuant to s 47 was not constrained by any obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants whose rights would be affected, indeed extinguished, by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 47. The Minister acknowledged that generally one would expect that a power of the kind contained in s 47 would be subject to a duty to accord procedural fairness and that the Commonwealth's power to acquire land by compulsion contained in the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (Cth) (" Lands Acquisition Act ") was generally subject to an obligation to notify affected parties. The Minister then submitted that the NER Act was enacted with a view to a need to respond urgently to a national emergency and that s 47 was enacted as a separate power and that the usual procedural provisions in the Lands Acquisition Act were expressly put aside in relation to acquisitions under s 47. In this context the Minister referred to s 50(2) of the NER Act. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) and (2) of the NER Act excluded written and unwritten natural justice obligations. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) was an unambiguous statement that the s 47 power was not constrained, even by an unwritten law that might otherwise support an implication for a natural justice obligation. The Minister submitted that it was plain that the legislative expressly turned its mind to, and excluded, procedural fairness that was expressed in written law.

I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that this is not the proper construction and effect of s 50. Put another way, I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the provisions of s 47 of the NER Act taken with the provisions of s 50 do not oust the obligation cast upon the Minister to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants who will be affected by the proposed notice. I consider it is arguable that s 50 is concerned with laws whether written or unwritten which are inconsistent with the provisions of Div 1 and Div 2 of the Act. I consider that it is clearly arguable that the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness are not inconsistent with the exercise of power to give a notice under s 47. As the applicants submitted, it is arguable that natural justice is an adjunct to the exercise of that power.</text>

<tocase>Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<text>It is a well established principle that a statute will not be construed as excluding the operation of common law principles such as the obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness in appropriate circumstances unless there is a clear and unambiguous statement or inference to that effect to be extracted from the relevant legislation. In Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550 Mason J said at 584 - 585: 
 "The law has now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights, interests and legitimate expectations, subject only to the clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention.
 ...
 Where the decision in question is one for which provision is made by statute, the application and content of the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly depends to a large extent on the construction of the statute. In Mobil Oil Australia Pty. Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1) Kitto J. pointed out that the obligation to give a fair opportunity to parties in controversy to correct or contradict statements prejudicial to their view depends on 'the particular statutory framework'. What is appropriate in terms of natural justice depends on the circumstances of the case and they will include, inter alia, the nature of the inquiry, the subject-matter, and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting: Reg. v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ; Ex parte Angliss Group (2) ; National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd (3) .
 ...
 When the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly in its application to administrative decision-making is so understood, the need for a strong manifestation of contrary statutory intention in order for it to be excluded becomes apparent. The critical question in most cases is not whether the principles of natural justice apply. It is: what does the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular case? It will be convenient to consider at the outset whether the statute displaces the duty when the statute contains a specific provision to that effect, for then it will be pointless to inquire what the duty requires in the circumstances of the case, unless there are circumstances not contemplated by the statutory provision that may give rise to a legitimate expectation. However, in general, it will be a matter of determining what the duty to act fairly requires in the way of procedural fairness in the circumstances of the case. A resolution of that question calls for an examination of the statutory provisions and the interests which I have already mentioned."

With that background I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that the Minister has not accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness at this point in time in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47. The proposal to give the s 47 notice was first raised or articulated clearly by the Minister in the letter of 24 May 2009. Prior to that time there had been numerous consultations and dialogue between the Minister and the representatives of the Housing Associations and the tenants but that was in relation to the proposal that the Housing Associations enter into 40 year sub-leases.

Whether the Minister has accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47 is to be determined by her conduct and the conduct of her department on and after 24 May 2009. I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the media release, the letters sent by the Minister to the Council and to the Housing Associations, the meetings held subsequently with some of the tenants and other persons and the leaflet distributions have not been sufficient to discharge the Minister's obligation to bring to the attention of all the tenants the manner in which the proposed notice will affect their rights. There is also a serious question to be tried that they have not been given a proper opportunity to make submissions to the Minister. I am not satisfied that a process or procedure has been adopted whereby sufficient attempts were made to bring these matters to the attention of all the tenants. The evidence before me is insufficient to satisfy me that all the tenants have been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister and have had fairly and squarely put before them the consequences of the Minister giving a notice pursuant to s 47. The leaflets do not make it clear that the tenants' rights to occupy their properties by way of sub-leases will be extinguished forever. Further, this was not made clear at the meeting on 29 June 2009 or in the leaflets that were distributed in the town camps.

I accept the Minister's submission that the content of natural justice is to be determined by reference to the circumstances of the case: Kioa v West [supra]. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried that the content of the natural justice principle in the circumstances of this case requires that the tenants be told directly, and not indirectly through the Housing Associations or the Council, that a consequence of the giving of the notice is the extinguishment of their rights to occupy their houses. The Minister submitted that a decision to acquire land by compulsion might in the ordinary case be regarded as having grave consequences for a person holding an interest in the land but that in the present case the evidence disclosed that the practical effect of a decision by the Minister to acquire the land pursuant to s 47 was substantially different to the ordinary case. The Minister submitted that the reality was that there would only be a beneficial impact on the living conditions of the town camp inhabitants. The difficulty with that submission is that it ignores, or it does not take into account, the fact that there will be an extinguishment of tenants' rights of occupation of their houses. To submit, as the Minister did, that "subject to new tenancy agreements being necessary, no other legal rights of the applicant or group members are impacted", is to ignore the fact that enforceable rights are being replaced with an opportunity to negotiate a new tenancy agreement which opportunity depends upon agreement between two parties.

The next inquiry to be made is whether the balance of convenience is in favour or against the grant of an injunction. I am satisfied that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until such time as the Court can be satisfied that: 
(a) the tenants have been given clear and unambiguous information that if the notice is given their tenancy rights over the land they occupy pursuant to their sub-leases will be extinguished forever; and
 
(b) the tenants have been given the opportunity to make submissions to the Minister after they have been given this information.

I do not intend to prescribe the process which the Minister should undertake in order to discharge her obligations to accord the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness. What I am disposed to do is to grant an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until further order. Such an injunction will enable the Minister to take such steps as she may consider, or she may be advised, will bring to the attention of the tenants the consequences of the giving of the notice and will give them an opportunity to make submissions to her. The injunction will be cast in terms restraining the Minister from giving a notice until further order. It will not be cast in terms restraining the Minister from taking any steps in and towards the giving of the notice.</text>

<text>Further, as Senior Counsel for the Minister submitted, the tort of intimidation also requires establishing an intention on the part of the alleged tortfeasor to cause economic harm: Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel [1995] HCA 65 ; (1994) 185 CLR 307 at 342. There was no evidence before me of such an intention by the Minister. Indeed the intention of the Minister is to the contrary.

The costs of the application for interlocutory relief in both proceedings will be reserved for further consideration.

<tocase>Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329</tocase>
<text>In Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329 the majority of the High Court, in relation to the tort of interference with trade or business interests by unlawful means said at 342: 
 "There are, however, several reasons for concluding that a want of procedural fairness by the appellant before giving the direction that he gave to the Bureau is not conduct that can be characterised as 'unlawful means' for the purposes of this tort". 

 
I consider that this observation is equally applicable to the tort of intimidation.</text>

<tocase>Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Ltd (2009) 69 ACSR 365</tocase>
<text>As was pointed out in Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Ltd (2009) 69 ACSR 365 at 378-379: 
 "The 'contrary to the interests' provision now contained in subpara (d) of s 232 [of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)] has a separate and distinct area of operation from the 'oppression' provisions in subpara (e) of s 232. The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company"

The Housing Associations have made it clear that the reason or, at least the main reason, why they propose to enter into 40 year sub-leases with the Director is to avoid the alternative of the Minister exercising power under s 47 of the NER Act to give notice which will have the effect of extinguishing forever the interests of the Housing Associations in the relevant pieces of land. The attitude of the Housing Associations on this issue was made abundantly clear in a letter from their solicitors to the Minister on 29 July 2009 which was, inter alia, in the following terms: 
 "As you know, and as we are now instructed to make clear, the Housing Associations are prepared to enter into the proposed 40 year subleases notwithstanding your rejection of their many requests for the inclusion of terms and conditions designed to further protect the ongoing interests of the Housing Associations, tenants and residents. The Housing Associations have agreed to enter into the subleases for the simple reason that you have threatened them with compulsory acquisition if they do not enter into the subleases. As you know, the loss of tenure to these lands is something that is abhorrent to the Housing Associations and they could not run the risk that it might occur. It is in the overriding best interests of the Associations and their members that their interests in these lands be maintained rather than completely foregone. Acquisitions of these land would not allow the Associations or members to have any input into protecting their rights or interests. 

 
 Indeed, this ultimate risk of compulsory acquisition has hovered in the background throughout the protected negotiations. That risk was made abundantly clear when you issued notice that you were considering these compulsory acquisitions. Likewise, your letter to Tangentyere dated 24 July 2009 makes it perfectly clear that unless the subleases are entered into in the terms attached to your letter then you will proceed in relation to the potential compulsory acquisitions."

Counsel for the Housing Associations submitted that it was in the overriding best interests of the Housing Associations and the tenants of the Housing Associations to retain their perpetual leases and not to have their titles extinguished by compulsory acquisition. He submitted initially that the Housing Associations were prepared to grant the sub-leases to the Director for two reasons. Firstly, because it appeared that it was the only way that Commonwealth funding would be provided. Secondly, because it was the only way to avoid compulsory acquisition.</text>
