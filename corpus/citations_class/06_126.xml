<tocase>Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453</tocase>
<text>56 This point was made in Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453 at 459 where Davies J observed that, notwithstanding the width of the definition of 'inappropriate conduct', it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed:
 
 'The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners. Therefore, under Pt VAA, the power to discipline in relation to "inappropriate practice" must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like. Accordingly, the reference to "inappropriate practice" in s 82 refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered. The Commonwealth's interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill, that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur.'

57 The applicant contends that the comments of Gibbs J quoted at [37] above are not to be taken as stating a 'blanket proposition' that any regulation of the manner in which practice is conducted is within power. This is clearly correct. However, his Honour's statement that:
 
 'If the incident of practice which is regulated is not medical or dental, but financial or administrative, it is clearly outside the prohibition', 

cannot be used, as the applicant attempts to do, as authority for the proposition that any attempt to regulate an incident of practice which is medical or dental will fall within the prohibition.

58 The applicant puts forward the General Practitioners case as authority for the blanket proposition that it is constitutionally impermissible to regulate any performance by medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions; that such regulation was equated with compulsion and therefore with conscription. This however is not what is held in the General Practitioners case. What was crucial for Gibbs J in the General Practitioners case was that no medical service was compelled. This is quite clear from his Honour's comments at 559-60:
 
 'The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices, but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out, and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services. Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice, rather than to a medical service itself. The only possible exception is s 16A (1), which requires that a request by a medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render a pathology service shall be made or confirmed in writing as prescribed. A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service. However, s 16A(1) does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request. What it requires is that the request, if made, be made or confirmed by written instrument which satisfies reg. 5. There is nothing in that regulation which affects in the slightest the performance by a medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions. The statutory requirements may impose on him more administrative work. In particular he is required to specify, in his own handwriting, the services to which the instrument relates, and cannot simply mark a form on which is printed a list of possible services. The reason why a condition of this kind is attached to the entitlement to medical benefits is no doubt that the use of the printed form might reasonably be regarded as likely to contribute to laxity and to facilitate fraud. However that may be, to require a practitioner to write out particulars of the service which he has decided to request another practitioner to perform is not to compel the practitioner making the request to perform a medical service. Even more clearly, the requirements of s 16A(2) with regard to accounts and receipts, and those of s 16A(3) with regard to the retention and production of any written request or confirmation, do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical service. ... 
 For these reasons none of the provisions in question imposes any form of civil conscription contrary to s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution .

59 I have quoted his Honour's comments at length to make quite clear his Honour's position. His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because, put simply, that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself; although it may have been incidental to a medical service; and where a medical service was regulated, as by requiring a request to be made in writing, the medical service itself was not compelled. These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional.

60 In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation. For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services. The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision. The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealth's power under s 51(xxiiiA) to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription. In my view a proper application of the term 'inappropriate practice' would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth.

61 For the above reasons the applicant's challenge to the constitutional validity of PSR Scheme must fail. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding sixty-one (61) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.

<tocase>Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1935/31.html</AustLII>
<text>51 The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power, whether arising by implication or expressly under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution , it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or, as Rich J said, not to put the cart before the horse; Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533 at 563. The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case. The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s 81 of the Constitution . Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s 81 authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction, the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid. His Honour, at 270, put the point thus:
 
 ' [T] he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan; the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money.'

52 Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, s 51(xxiiiA) has, of course, authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements. However, as the General Practitioners case shows, the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR.

53 The applicant accepts that matters 'merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine' do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealth's administration of its benefits scheme. In the applicant's written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters. The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealth's provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard.</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 30 ; (1945) 71 CLR 237</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/30.html</AustLII>
<text>27 Section 51(xxiiiA) was inserted into the Constitution by amendment pursuant to s 128 of the Constitution . The proposed amendment had been approved by the necessary majorities of electors and was assented to on 19 December 1946. In explaining the background to this amendment in BMA at 285 , Williams J referred to the different views as to the proper scope of s 81 of the Constitution (Commonwealth power of appropriation) expressed in Attorney-General for Victoria v Commonwealth [1945] HCA 30 ; (1945) 71 CLR 237 (' Pharmaceutical Benefits Case') and to the likelihood, if the point arose for decision, that a majority of the Court would hold that the Commonwealth could only expend its money on those forms of social services expressly authorised by the Constitution , namely invalid and old age pensions authorised by s 51(xxiii). The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s 51(xxiiiA) had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription; see also D Mendelson, "Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee: The History of Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution " (1999) 23 MULR 308 .

31 Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion; at 287. In his Honour's view, however, the fact that s 7A carried a penalty for non-compliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners, in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary, to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth, the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth. Williams J summarised his view at 289:
 
 'The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment, so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth. He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act. ... He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient. But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment. It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is super-imposed upon the contract of the parties. It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written.'

37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case (Latham CJ at 249, Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294) to the effect that 'a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription'. At 557, Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus:
 
 'That expression, ['any form of civil conscription'] used in its natural meaning, and applied, as the context of par. (xxiiiA) requires, to medical and dental services, refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services. However, in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do, in a particular way, some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service, when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service. ... it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers. ... There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression "any form of civil conscription" where it appears s 51(xxiiiA) should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear. The words "any form of" do not, in my opinion, extend the meaning of "conscription", and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed. Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services, but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA) that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed, and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained. I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par. (xxiiiA) any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind, provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed.</text>

<tocase>Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth [1949] HCA 44 ; (1949) 79 CLR 201</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/44.html</AustLII>
<text>25 In making these submissions the applicant relies on the decision of the High Court in The General Practitioners Society in Australia v Commonwealth of Australia [1980] HCA 30 ; (1980) 145 CLR 532 ('General Practitioners case'). In the alternative the applicant submits that:
 
 (a) GPS is distinguishable and does not apply to the present case; and/or 
 (b) the construction of 'civil conscription' in GPS is incorrect and should not be accepted by this Court. Rather, it is submitted, the broader view of what constitutes 'civil conscription' taken by Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ in Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth [1949] HCA 44 ; (1949) 79 CLR 201 ('BMA case') should be accepted.

28 In the BMA case , the High Court held that the prohibition against civil conscription in s 51(xxiiiA) applied only to medical and dental services and not to the other elements of the section. At issue was the validity of s 7A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947 (Cth) which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits. It was an offence, carrying a penalty of [sterling]50, for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written. The majority of the High Court (Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s 51(xxiiiA).

29 Latham CJ emphasised, at 243, that the power given to the Commonwealth under s 51(xxiiiA) is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service. The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services, the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing 'position in the community', that is, a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine. His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth, when providing benefits out of public moneys, to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys.

30 The Chief Justice also said (at 249) that the term 'civil conscription' is wider than 'industrial conscription' and is applicable to "any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation, perform particular work, or perform work in a particular way." The Chief Justice emphasised that the words 'any form of' in s 51(xxiiiA) evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be 'completely voluntary'. Considering s 7A, his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list, the doctor is not given any live option. Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice. The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting (at 253):
 
 'There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way, and possibly in the only way, in which he is qualified to earn a living.' 

Webb J expressed a similar view at 292-3.

32 The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at 294:
 
 'To reiterate: if s 7A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form, which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both, would request a service which only a doctor can render, and which therefore is properly described as a medical service. But when this service is made compulsory by a fine, or loss of practice to avoid the fine ...then, having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time, it becomes, I think, not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which, if not quite clear, was certainly intended to be comprehensive. It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors.' 

His Honour's comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding.

33 The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of 'civil conscription' in any detail is the General Practitioners case . Certain provisions of the HIA (ss 16A, 16B and 16C) and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services (other than prescribed pathology services) and also imposed obligations on some, at least, of the persons providing those services. It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an 'approved pathology practitioner'. The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services.

34 The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct. They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner. The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at 549:
 
 'First, it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind. Secondly, it was said, the laws, by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way, compel them to carry on practice in a different way. ... it was argued for the plaintiffs that few practitioners would be able to attract patients, or to make a living from their profession, if medical benefits were not payable in respect of their services, and that therefore, if ss 16A, 16B and 16C are valid, a practitioner who intends to render pathology services (whether as a specialist or as a general practitioner) is compelled by practical considerations to apply to become an approved pathology practitioner.'

37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case (Latham CJ at 249, Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294) to the effect that 'a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription'. At 557, Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus:
 
 'That expression, ['any form of civil conscription'] used in its natural meaning, and applied, as the context of par. (xxiiiA) requires, to medical and dental services, refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services. However, in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do, in a particular way, some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service, when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service. ... it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers. ... There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression "any form of civil conscription" where it appears s 51(xxiiiA) should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear. The words "any form of" do not, in my opinion, extend the meaning of "conscription", and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed. Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services, but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA) that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed, and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained. I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par. (xxiiiA) any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind, provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed.</text>

<tocase>Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1917/26.html</AustLII>
<text>21 There is no challenge to Dr Selim's standing to bring the present proceeding. The respondents have accepted that should the applicant be disqualified from participating in the Medicare Scheme, then for the period of the disqualification the applicant's patients would not receive benefits in respect of the applicant's professional services. The respondents accept that, depending on the length of any disqualification the applicant 'may lose a number of his patients'. The pervasiveness of the Medicare Scheme and its role in covering an individual's medical expenses or, at least, in subsidising those expenses, is sufficiently well known generally as to allow me to take judicial notice of this and of its impact on medical practitioners who are unable to participate in the scheme; Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149 ; Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 144. It is not difficult to conclude that the consequences for a medical practitioner who is excluded from the scheme would be sufficiently serious. The disadvantages of operating outside the Medicare Scheme are such as, in my view, to impose practical, if not legal compulsion, to participate in the Scheme.

22 The written submissions made on behalf of the applicant went into considerable detail about the repercussions for the applicant should he be disqualified from the Medicare Benefits Scheme for up to three years. These included the virtual devastation of his practice and loss of his livelihood. As I have explained above these submissions are not relevant to the issue I have to decide. The applicant sought judicial review of the decisions of the Director and the Committee. Jacobson J dismissed that application. I understand that, pending the outcome of the present constitutional challenge to the legislation, no penalties have been imposed on the applicant. Whether or not hardship submissions will be relevant to the assessment of any penalty is not for me to say. The issue of whether the PSR exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth however, cannot depend on issues of hardship particular to an individual practitioner.

23 It is not in contention that medical practitioners are not obliged to participate in the Medicare Scheme. Nevertheless, the applicant contends that the realities underlying the medical benefits scheme are such that 'realistically, economically and practically' it requires medical practitioners to become approved medical providers in order for them to practise as general practitioners. The applicant submits that the HIA requires general practitioners to provide medical services in a manner designated as 'appropriate' but which is 'unstated and undefined'. According to the applicant, this dictates the 'kinds of and manner in which medical services are actually provided' and attaches significant sanctions to a failure to conform including disqualification from participation in the scheme for up to three years, public reprimand and/or the imposition of substantial repayments of Medicare benefits paid to them or assigned to them by their patients. By so doing, the applicant submits, the HIA 'impermissibly' constitutes civil conscription.</text>
