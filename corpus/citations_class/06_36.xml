<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Macleod (1994) 54 FCR 309</tocase>
<text>57 The respondents contended that Ms Wu's application should fail because she failed to provide legally admissible evidence of all the facts necessary to substantiate her entitlement to the relief claimed. Under the former O 10 r 7, an applicant was required to file proof by way of evidence of his or her claims when seeking judgment: see Australian Securities Commission v Macleod (1994) 54 FCR 309 at 312-313 per Drummond J. Under the new O 35A r 3, it now seems that reliance may be placed on the allegations in the relevant statement of claim. Judges of the Court have held that the rule does not require proof by way of evidence of the applicant's claim, but that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for the relief sought and that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1 CellNet LLC [2005] FCA 856 at [14] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert [2005] FCA 1311 at [6] --[7] per Jackson J and Deisel Spa v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J. Having read the statement of claim, I find that these conditions are satisfied. Accordingly, the motion does not fail because of an insufficiency of evidence showing entitlement to relief claimed.</text>

<tocase>Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 388</tocase>
<text>49 In Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 388 (" Lenijamar "), Wilcox and Gummow JJ considered the nature of the Court's power when a party is in default. Although Lenijamar concerned the former O 10 r 7, certain of their Honours' observations can be applied to O 35A: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1718 (" Cadbury Schweppes ") at [22]-[23] per Ryan J. As with O 35A, the power given by the former O 10 r 7 is conditioned only upon the failure of the party to comply with an order of the Court directing that party to take a step in the proceeding. There is no requirement of intentional default or contumelious conduct, or of inordinate and inexcusable delay, or of prejudice to the other party: Lenijamar at 395-396. These are, however, usually important factors to be weighed in the exercise of the discretion. Further, the power conferred on the Court must be "administered sensibly and with an appreciation both of the fact that some delays are unavoidable, and unpredictable ... and of the likely serious consequences to [the party in default]": Lenijamar at 396.

50 In Lenijamar , Wilcox and Gummow JJ also observed that, while it was undesirable to make any exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which the power granted by O 10 r 7 would be appropriately exercised, there were two obvious candidates for such exercise: "cases in which the history of non-compliance ... is such as to indicate an inability or unwillingness to co-operate with the Court and the other party or parties in having the matter ready for trial within an acceptable period and cases ... in which the non-compliance is continuing and occasioning unnecessary delay, expense or other prejudice to the [other party]": Lenijamar at 396.</text>

<tocase>KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1995/354.html</AustLII>
<text>51 When applying these principles, the Court must balance the need for the expeditious conduct of litigation, particularly in a court committed to a case management system, and the "the strong reluctance of courts to prevent litigants having a proper opportunity to present their cases": KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 per Tamberlin J. Ms Wu's motion must also be considered in light of the other powers of the Court to sanction non-compliance, such as the use of costs orders.

52 The history of this matter is troubling. The first and second respondents have been in default numerous times in the course of this proceeding. They filed their first lists of discoverable documents on 18 February 2004, over three months after the original deadline and over a month after orders by consent that they be filed by 15 January 2004. Moreover, these lists were filed only after Ms Wu brought two motions for compliance. Subsequent to this, Ms Wu has been required to take extraordinary steps to secure inspection of documents.

53 In addition, it is clear that Ms Wu has been frustrated by other action, or inaction, by these respondents, even if not amounting to non-compliance with court orders. The application for substituted service, the initial failure to seek to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, the failure of the respondents personally to attend mediation, the resignation of Barry Armitage from office in Avin, and the frequent changes in legal representation are matters that have undoubtedly caused Ms Wu vexation and have made the conduct of litigation more difficult than it would otherwise have been. Having regard to their conduct, I find that the first and second respondents have failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence. They are therefore in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules.</text>

<tocase>Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/66.html</AustLII>
<text>54 Despite this conclusion and the unsatisfactory history of the proceeding, I would not at this stage make orders precisely in the terms of the present motion. Instead, pursuant to O 35A r 3(2)(e), I would order that judgment for $334,000 and interest thereon against the first and second respondents be given under O 35A r 3(2)(c) if the first and second respondents do not comply with the costs order that I propose to make (see below). I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part. If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents. Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody. Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J. Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation.

55 I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays. These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation. Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents. They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor. Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents.

56 In these circumstances, any prejudice caused to Ms Wu can, at this stage, be met by an appropriate costs order, subject to an entitlement to enter judgment in the event of non-compliance with such an order. Plainly enough, this is not to condone the delay occasioned by Avin and Barry Armitage; and this is not an invitation to them to continue to litigate this matter in the unsatisfactory manner they have thus far done. As indicated below, it is appropriate that they pay Ms Wu's costs of the motion on an indemnity basis; and, since they are in fact in default, that there be orders of the kind contemplated by O 35A r 3(2)(e). I also note that there is again apparently no solicitor on the record. The repeated last-minute retainer of solicitor and counsel to is mischievous since it militates against the efficient conduct of the litigation. The evidence of Mr Liberogiannis about the Armitages' failure to cooperate with their legal advisers is concerning. Nothing in these reasons would preclude Ms Wu from bringing fresh notices of motions for summary judgment upon further breaches of court orders.</text>
