<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/26.html</AustLII>
<text>Because s 269ZHF(5) required the CEO to give reasons for any recommendation it is possible to analyse whether the CEO performed the statutory function of making the recommendation for continuation of the measures against Siam in accordance with the Act. The Minister declared in the notice that he gave under s 269ZHG(1) that he had accepted the CEO's recommendations, reasons and findings. Where a statute requires a decision-maker to arrive at a state of satisfaction as a condition of the exercise of a power, the courts can review whether the power has been exercised according to law: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-276 Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. If the statute requires a decision-maker to be satisfied as to a certain matter or matters before making a decision, the decision can be set aside at common law if it is affected by a jurisdictional error. In instances where matters of opinion or taste or policy are involved, the courts have recognised that it may be very difficult to show that the decision-maker has made a jurisdictional error by misconstruing the applicable test, asking the wrong question, making some other mistake of law, taking into account an extraneous reason or excluding from consideration some factor that should affect the determination: Wu Shan Liang 185 CLR at 275-276; Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J; Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119.

<tocase>East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 233 CLR 229</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/44.html</AustLII>
<text>The Report did not explain what, if anything, was identified as a factor that had been eliminated from consideration. It is not possible to read this "finding" as another way of stating that the CEO or the Minister had not attributed for the purposes of s 269TAE(2A) any injury or threat of injury to Qenos to factors other than the exportation of goods from Thailand or by Siam. In effect, this passage in the Report, did no more than say that the CEO had considered those factors in the sense of having looked at, but discarded, them in a cursory way: cf East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 233 CLR 229 at 244 [52] per Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ, see also 256 [102] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. The attribution of dumping as the sole cause of the likelihood of material injury or its threat was fundamental to the imposition and continuation of anti-dumping measures. The CEO and the Minister had to give a reason to eliminate any factors other than dumping as being likely to cause such an injury or threat so as to arrive at the appropriate determination of what, if any, measures were needed to prevent that injury or threat, and if so, what the nature and extent of the measures would be.

No other reason supported the conclusion that the threat of material injury to Qenos would be caused by Siam's dumping (or dumping of Thai exports) alone if the measures were allowed to expire. The material in Report 137 was inadequate to establish that the CEO and the Minister had considered what was shown in confidential appendix 7 as undercutting, in accordance with s 269TAE(2), by not attributing any factor other than dumping as being likely to cause material injury. They took the undercutting itself into account as material establishing the likelihood of a threat of material injury. But, that material begged questions, that were left unanswered, as to why the differences in price appeared and what injury was likely to be caused. Because of this inadequacy, the CEO and the Minister did not, in fact, have sufficient material on which to be satisfied that expiration of the measures would be likely to lead to a threat of material injury to Qenos caused by Siam's dumping: see Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Consumer Commission (2008) 107 ALD 474 at 518-519 [180]-[182] where I examined the authorities; R v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Company Pty Ltd (1953) 188 CLR 100 at 120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ. As I said there ( Telstra 107 ALD 502 at 107): 
 "[107] Where a decision-maker must consider matters prescribed by law, generally, he or she cannot jettison or ignore some of those factors or give them cursory consideration only in order to put them to one side: East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2007) 233 CLR 229 ; 239 ALR 50 ; 97 ALD 274 ; 63 ACSR 404 ; [2007] HCA 44 at [52] ( East Australian Pipeline ) per Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1644.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents contended that it was open to the CEO to make the finding in Report 137 that in that context it was likely that there would be price convergence between Siam's imports and Qenos' product. They argued that the test of causation of material injury was "essentially a practical exercise that had the purpose of achieving an objective of determining whether, viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from dumping", relying on what Lockhart J had said in Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs [1991] FCA 49 ; (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144; and Schaefer Waste Technology Sdn Bhd v Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service [2006] FCA 1644 ; (2006) 156 FCR 94 at 115-116 [147] - [149] per Jacobson J. ISSUE TWO 
 Did the respondents misconstrue the application of s 269TAE(2B)?

The respondents responded that Report 137 had analysed whether material injury to Qenos was being caused or threatened in a practical manner as contemplated in Swan Portland 28 FCR at 144 and Schaefer 156 FCR at 115-116 [147]-[149]. They argued that the terms of s 269TAE(1) directed the Minister's enquiry to the exportation of goods from "the country of export", not to an individual exporter located there and that nothing in s 269TAE(2A) affected this construction. The respondents argued that Report 137 had considered Thai exports as a whole and their impact on the Australian industry in accordance with the requirements of Div 6A of Pt XVB. They contended that they had applied the right test and had used the non-injurious price analysis in Report 134 to arrive at their findings.

In Swan Portland 28 FCR at 144-145, Lockhart J examined the nature of a determination whether material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods to those dumped has been, or is being caused, or is threatened. He said that such a determination was not an exercise of counting heads of markets, production or distribution centres or things of that kind and that: 
 "It is essentially a practical exercise designed to achieve the objective of determining whether, when viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from the dumping of goods." 

 
And, he went on to emphasise that the finding of injury depends on the facts of the case and inevitably involves a question of degree, balancing all relevant considerations and integers, before concluding whether or not the dumping constitutes material injury to the Australian industry. That approach was approved by Black CJ, Neaves and von Doussa JJ in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Fraser [1992] FCA 120 ; (1992) 34 FCR 564 at 576, 577-578. The Full Court held that if the Australian ind`ustry had suffered detriment from a number of probable causes, then s 269TG required a determination whether there was a separate material injury or material incremental injury caused by the dumping over and above detriment caused by other factors: ICI Australia 34 FCR at 579. While in each of those cases the Court was considering the legislation in an earlier form than that it presently takes, those observations continue to assist in the construction of the present statutory scheme: see e.g. Schaefer 156 FCR at 115-116 [147]-[149] per Jacobson J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/62.html</AustLII>
<text>Thus, the formation of the requisite state of satisfaction by the CEO under s 269ZHF(2) is an essential precondition to the Minister being able to exercise his or her power under s 269ZHG(1) to decide whether or not to secure the continuation of the anti-dumping measures. And, the CEO's report under s 269ZHF , including the CEO's satisfaction, findings of fact, particulars of the evidence relied on and reasons to support the recommendations in accordance with s 269ZHF(2) and (5), must be considered by the Minister in arriving at a decision under s 269ZHG(1) , together with any other information he or she considers relevant. The discretion of the Minister in s 269ZHG(1) is expressed in wide terms. Nonetheless, it must be exercised within proper limits as Stephen, Mason, Murphy, Aickin and Wilson JJ explained in The Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 62 ; (1979) 144 CLR 45 at 49 where they said that: 
 "Here the problem lies in ascertaining what are the proper limits of the discretion. In the absence of some positive indication of the considerations on which a grant or refusal of consent is to depend, the discretion is "unconfined except in so far as the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the statutory enactments may enable the Court to pronounce given reasons to be definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view", to use the words of Dixon J in Browning ((1977) 74 CLR at p 505). In that case his Honour went on to remark, (as he had done earlier in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury [1937] HCA 15 ; (1937) 56 CLR 746 at p 758)), "on the impossibility, when an administrative discretion is undefined, of a court's doing more than saying that this or that consideration is extraneous to the power"."

Here, the limits of the discretion, are to be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of Pt XVB of the Act and, in particular, in the requirement of s 269ZHG(1) itself, that the Minister must consider the report of the CEO. In that consideration, the Minister must also consider, as a fundamental matter in exercising his or her discretion, the central finding of the report that, in accordance with s 269ZHF(2) , the CEO was satisfied that the expiration of the measures would lead or be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of both the dumping and the material injury that the anti-dumping measure is intended to prevent.

Thus, a review under Div 6A of Pt XVB is not intended as a complete replication of the process under Div 3 involved in the initial imposition of anti-dumping measures. But, the continuation review under Div 6A is still directed to the purpose of preventing material injury or the threat of such an injury caused by dumping. So, in exercising his or her discretion under s 269ZHG(1) , I am of opinion that the Minister must consider whether the existing measures are appropriate and adapted to achieve the purpose served by the measures identified in s 269ZHF(2) if they are to be continued.</text>

<tocase>United States Sunset Review of Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan (AB-2003-5)</tocase>
<text>Siam argued that the reasoning in Report 137 recording the CEO's satisfaction as to the matters set out in s 269ZHF(2) was the product of hypothesising about the impact of unknown and undefined future events that bore no causal relationship to the expiry of the measures. Siam contended that, the conclusions in Report 137 that the expiration of the measures would lead or be likely to lead to the occurrence or recurrence of both dumping and material injury, and particularly the likelihood of dumping causing or threatening material injury, were not sufficiently causally connected in a reasoning process in the Report to justify the decision to continue the measures against Siam. Siam argued that the respondents had used speculation rather than a rigorous examination of a kind envisaged by the WTO Appellate Body in United States Sunset Review of Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Japan (AB-2003-5) at [111].

The respondents argued that the terms of s 269ZHF(2) were materially similar to Art 11.3 of the implementation agreement. They argued that the considerations identified by Report 137, provided a reasoning process that was open to, and sufficient for, the CEO and the Minister. They referred to the finding in the Report that Siam had continued to dump the product in Australia even while the existing measures were in force, as leaving it open to the CEO and the Minister to conclude that it was likely that such activity would continue if the measures did not remain in place. The respondents accepted that the CEO was not empowered to make a recommendation under s 269ZHF(2) on the mere possibility of dumping or on no more than speculation, but contended that the CEO had had a more solid foundation for the recommendation and had correctly applied the relevant test.

The respondents contended that the CEO's conclusion that imports from Thailand actively competed on price with the product produced in Australia was open on the other findings in the Report notwithstanding that Siam's product was of a higher grade than Qenos'. They pointed to the findings that the average price of Thai imports at the end of 2007 was only slightly higher than Qenos' prices, despite Siam's being of a higher quality, and that the removal of duty from 1 January 2008 would only have improved the competitive position of Siam's products, if measures were not in place. They referred to the fact that Report 134 had ascertained a non-injurious price for Siam's products. They also relied on the Report's finding that Siam's product had a degree of substitutability that could cause injury to the Australian industry.</text>

<tocase>United States Sunset Reviews of Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina (AB-2004-4)</tocase>
<text>The respondents argued that s 269TAE(2B) had a limited role, and operated only in the situation in which there were no measures in place. They argued that s 269TAE(2B) had no relevance to an assessment of dumping, as opposed to material injury. The respondents contended that s 269ZHF(2) stated its own test for the purposes of a review under Div 6A of Pt XVB , and it was not constrained by, and applied in a different situation to, the test for imposing the measures originally under s 269TG(2) , using s 269TAE(2B). In addition, the respondents argued that they had considered the changes in market conditions, including that the market had continued to slow, in assessing that injury was likely, not merely threatened. They argued that there was also evidence of current pricing that would cause injury but for the measures and that sales at dumped prices would be below the non-injurious price. They relied on the decision of the WTO appellate body in United States Sunset Reviews of Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina (AB-2004-4) at [271]-[285] as supporting the approach that they had taken. ISSUE THREE 
 Should the respondents have excluded any factor other than Siam's exportation to Australia in considering whether any injury to Qenos was threatened?

Siam argued that the CEO made no findings in Report 137 about Siam or its relationship to any material, or other, injury to Qenos from dumping. Rather, Siam complained that the Report merely asserted, without any analysis or reasoning, that Customs had not attributed any potential injury from other factors as increasing any potential injury from dumping. It contended that s 269TAE(2A) required the respondents, first, to consider whether any other factors were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the Australian industry and, secondly, not to attribute that injury to any such factor.

The WTO Appellate Body found that it was necessary to conduct an analysis that rested on a sufficient factual basis in order for the anti-dumping agency to determine the likelihood of an injury based on "reasoned and adequate conclusions": Oil Country Tubular Goods (AB-2004-4) at [284]. In arriving at a conclusion under s 269TAE(1), the Minister must take account of the matters prescribed in ss 269TAE(2B) and 269TAE(2A). Thus, the question of the foreseeability and imminence of the threat of material injury must be addressed by eliminating factors other than the exportation of Siam's dumped goods in considering whether that dumping alone would be likely to lead to material injury to Qenos if the measures expired. The other aspect of a consideration whether an injury is caused or threatened is that the injury under consideration must be, itself, material. Once again, the imposition of measures is not authorised unless there is more than just a mere injury actual or threatened. Part XVB requires that the injury have the character of materiality to an Australian industry producing like goods.

Thus, in arriving at a reasoned and adequate conclusion based on sufficient facts for the purposes of imposing or reviewing the existing or continuation of measures, the Minister must address the question of the materiality of any injury that is under consideration.

Here, Report 137 adverted to a number of relevant changes in circumstances. First, it noted the removal of Customs duty from 1 January 2008. This factor could impact on the market in Australia immediately following the period of review ending in the December 2007 quarter. And, Report 137 noted that regional markets had begun to slow, which, it suggested, was likely to create an environment where Qenos was more susceptible to injury caused by dumping. It also concluded that Qenos' performance showed some signs of deterioration towards the end of the five quarters examined.</text>
