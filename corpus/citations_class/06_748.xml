<tocase>Air India v Commonwealth [1977] 1 NSWLR 449</tocase>
<text>61 The applicant referred to three cases in support of its claim. The first is Air India v Commonwealth [1977] 1 NSWLR 449, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. The facts of the case can be briefly summarised. The owner of the Sydney International Airport, the Commonwealth, demanded increased rent from the lessees, a number of airlines, purportedly pursuant to their leases. In general terms, the airlines paid the increased rent, but stated that they may need to challenge the validity of the rent increase.

62 The airlines brought claims for money had and received on the basis of compulsion. The trial judge found that the Commonwealth had no right to require the payment of increased rent. However, he refused to order the repayment of the increased rent because he found the payments had been made voluntarily. That latter finding was the focus of the appeal.

63 The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's finding that there had been no compulsion. It did so on the basis that there was no express threat to forfeit the leases should the increased rent be paid, and that such a threat could not reasonably be implied. The Court found (at 455):
 
 It hardly seems to be reasonable to fear that the Commonwealth would determine the leases of seven major international airlines servicing Sydney and Australia because of a rent dispute involving the construction of a lease document, when they could be held to their leases and sued to fruitful verdicts. Bringing about an almost empty and non-productive facility would hardly seem a likely course of action."

64 The applicant contends that its case stands in sharp distinction to that of Air India . It points to the two letters from the first respondent, extracted above, dated 6 and 12 March 2003, and the file note of the conversation of 17 March 2003. It submits that in its case a clear threat to evict was being made.</text>

<text>120 In the face of a plain inconsistency within a lease, regard must be had to the general canons of contractual construction. The objective intention of the parties must be ascertained, and a common sense and commercially sensible approach must be taken.

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>171 The relevant principles relating to the imposition of indemnity costs were summarised by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (at 233-4):
 
 "In consequence of the settled practice which exists, the Court ought not usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis other than the party and party basis. The circumstances of the case must be such as to warrant the Court in departing from the usual course. That has been the view of all judges dealing with applications for payment of costs on the indemnity or some other basis whether here or in England. The tests have been variously put. The Court of Appeal in Andrews v. Barnes (supra) at 141 said the Court had a general and discretionary power to award costs as between solicitor and client "as and when the justice of the case might so require." Woodward J in Fountain Selected Meats appears to have adopted what was said by Brandon LJ (as he was) in Preston v. Preston (supra) at 637; namely, there should be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the Court in departing from the ordinary practice. Most judges dealing with the problem have resolved the particular case before them by dealing with the circumstances of that case and finding in it the presence or absence of factors which would be capable, if they existed, of warranting a departure from the usual rule. But as French J said (at p 8) in Tetijo , "The categories in which the discretion may be exercised are not closed". Davies J expressed (at p 6) similar views in Ragata (supra). 
 
 Notwithstanding the fact that that is so, it is useful to note some of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion. I instance the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (both referred to by Woodward J in Fountain and also by Gummow J in Thors v Weekes (1989) 92 ALR 131 at 152; evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties (French J in Tetijo ); the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive (Davies J in Ragata ) or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (Woodward J in Fountain and French J in J-Corp (supra)); the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (Davies J in Ragata ); an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg Messiter v Hutchinson (1987) 10 NSWLR 525, Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No. 2) (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 724 (Court of Appeal), Crisp v Keng (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, Kirby P, Priestly JA, Cripps JA, No 40744/1992, 27 September 1993) and an award of costs on an indemnity basis against a contemnor (eg Megarry V-C in EMI Records (supra)). Other categories of cases are to be found in the reports. Yet others to arise in the future will have different features about them which may justify an order for costs on the indemnity basis. The question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis. 
 
 
 
 It remains to say that the existence of particular facts and circumstances capable of warranting the making of an order for payment of costs, for instance, on the indemnity basis, does not mean that judges are necessarily obliged to exercise their discretion to make such an order. The costs are always in the discretion of the trial judge. Provided that discretion is exercised having regard to the applicable principles and the particular circumstances of the instant case its exercise will not be found to have miscarried unless it appears that the order which has been made involves a manifest error or injustice." (emphasis added)

173 Although the second respondent submits that the facts going to causation were entirely matters within the knowledge of the applicant, and about which it had the onus to adduce evidence, I do not consider that its case was "hopeless", or, in the words of Sheppard J in "wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law". This is a very high bar indeed to meet.

174 Nor do I consider that the applicant imprudently rejected an offer of compromise. The second respondent's offer can hardly be described as generous. It was an offer for each party to walk away and bear their own costs. Moreover, the offer was made very early in the proceeding, prior to discovery being given by the parties. In addition, the offer appears to have been open for, at most, 24 hours. The 16 February 2004 offer requested a response to the offer no later than 10 am the following day. One can hardly be critical of the applicant rejecting an offer in these circumstances.

175 I also do not consider that the applicant's failure to withdraw the claim at an earlier time constitutes a basis for indemnity costs to be awarded in relation to the entire claim against the second respondent. I am not prepared to infer that it was incorporated in the proceeding in order to prejudice the Court against the respondents. Nor was the deceit claim "irrelevant" in the sense in which the authorities on indemnity costs use that term. An "irrelevant" claim is one that has nothing to do with the matters in dispute between the parties. That can hardly be said to be true in the present case. The arrangements between the first and second respondent with respect to the leasing of the premises are important, given that the second respondent provided a rental assessment to the first respondent, and that assessment was central to the first respondent's attempt to increase the rent.

176 The second respondent does have an arguable case for being paid its costs on an indemnity basis with respect to the deceit claim alone. As previously indicated, the claim should have been withdrawn, at the very latest, following the cross-examination of Mr Allen. An explanation for the internal Colliers email which pricked the applicant's attention was given in the defences of the respondents. No affidavit material was adduced by the applicant to meet those denials.

177 However, I am not inclined to make an order that the applicant pay the second respondent's costs of the deceit claim on an indemnity basis. Those costs, in the context of the entire proceeding, are likely to be insubstantial. Moreover, separating out these costs from those of the rest of the proceeding is likely to be a difficult process which is unwarranted in the circumstances, particularly given that the applicant is already paying those costs on a party/party basis.</text>

<tocase>Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4</tocase>
<text>129 In general, costs follow the event and any departure from this principle should only occur in exceptional circumstances: Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (1979) 28 ALR 201; Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4; and Ritter v Godfrey [1920] 2 KB 47 at 52-3.

136 First, the applicant submits that although it only succeeded on one of its claims, it only needed to succeed on one. It relies upon the following comments of Jacobs J in Cretazzo (at 16), cited with approval by Toohey J in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR |P40-748 (at 48,136):
 
 "trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issue of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case, including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no two cases are alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded, based merely on his success in those particular issues."</text>

<tocase>David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1992] HCA 48 ; (1992) 175 CLR 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/48.html</AustLII>
<text>73 Second, the first respondent submits that a prima facie right to recover will be displaced where it would be consistent with good conscience to allow the lessor to retain the overpaid rent. It referred to the statement of the High Court in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1992] HCA 48 ; (1992) 175 CLR 353 (at 379) that a defendant "is entitled to raise by way of answer any matter or circumstance which shows that his or her receipt (or retention) of the payment is not unjust".

74 The first respondent contends that if it were ordered to refund the overpaid rent in its entirety, the applicant would obtain a windfall benefit. It would be a windfall because at the time that this dispute arose, the applicant conceded there should have been a rental increase, at least up to the level assessed by Mr Ned Walsh, whose assessment is discussed in the primary judgment.

89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.

91 Despite Deane J's overture in Pavey &amp; Matthews that "unjust enrichment" assists in determining whether the law should recognise new categories of restitution, in David Securities , the majority (Mason CJ, Deane Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) noted that (at 379):
 
 "it is not legitimate to determine whether an enrichment is unjust by reference to some subjective evaluation of what is fair or unconscionable. Instead, recovery depends upon the existence of a qualifying or vitiating factor such as mistake, duress or illegality."

92 It is therefore clear from the High Court's approach in David Securities and Roxborough that while the categories of restitution are not closed, the "established categories" still provide, at the very least, the starting point for analysing restitutionary claims.

111 Turning to the question whether the applicant's restitutionary claim was properly pleaded, I agree that the claim was not pleaded as well as it could have been. However, Mason and Carter make some salient observations about pleading claims for restitution. The learned authors state (at [2904]):
 
 "A pleading that asserts in the abstract that P was unjustly enriched at D's expense will usually be struck out. The authorities require the basis of such an allegation to be explained in the pleading. 
 
 In light of the general statements in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia , courts have been averse to pleadings which simply appeal to 'idiosyncratic notions of what is fair and just', or which plead generalised claims based on unjust enrichment. 
 
 We explain elsewhere why it is legitimate to say that causes of action arise in restitution. Nevertheless, we are not advocating pleadings which rely merely on 'unjust enrichment', unless the essential facts are set out . ... 
 
 Pleaders are unlikely to allege unjust enrichment in a context devoid of any facts, and the likelihood that the facts pleaded might attract some novel restitutionary claim in this fast-developing area of the law, saw Gummow J refusing to strike out such a pleading in Winterton Constructions Pty Ltd v Hambros Australia Ltd ." (footnotes removed)

112 The applicant pleaded its claim of "unjust enrichment" by reference to the invalidity of the notice. While it could have more clearly identified the claim as one for restitution on the basis of money had and received, the relevant issue was adequately raised. In addition, as Mason and Carter point out, there are good reasons not to plead claims in restitution with a great degree of specificity. In a developing area of the law, where the categories of claims are not closed, an applicant should not shut itself out of making a case for "some novel restitutionary claim", as long as the relevant facts upon which the claim is based are identified.

113 As it turns out, the facts in this case do not "attract some novel restitutionary claim". They fall squarely within an established category an action for money had and received. However, it is for the above reasons that I am satisfied that the applicant pleaded its claim for restitution adequately.

114 The applicant and first respondent are in dispute over the exact amount of money which was overpaid. The dispute surrounds three issues:
 
 &#8226; whether interest can be claimed on the GST component of the overpaid rent when the applicant would have received an "input tax credit" from the Australian Taxation Office for those sums;
 &#8226; whether the appropriate interest rate to be applied to the overpaid rent is the penalty rate or the business overdraft rate as specified by the Reserve Bank of Australia; and
 &#8226; whether the first respondent was entitled to an automatic increase in rent of three per cent on 1 September 2005, pursuant to clause 3.2.1, irrespective of whether it has served a notice under that clause.

115 Section 51A(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) provides significant discretion in determining questions relating to the application of interest to any award of money. It is in the following terms:
 
 "In any proceedings, for the recovery of any money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods) in respect of a cause of action that arises after the commencement of this section, the Court or a Judge shall, upon application, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, either: 
 
 
 
 (a) order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as the Court or the Judge, as the case may be, thinks fit on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered ..."

<tocase>EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382</tocase>
<text>117 In relation to the appropriate interest rate to be applied, the applicant submits that the penalty interest rate, as specified in Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic), should be used to calculate interest in this case. It referred to my judgment in McCormick v Riverwood International (Australia) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 32 in support of that submission. In that case I applied the penalty interest rate after citing the following observations of Heerey J in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 (at 384): 
 
 "I think there is obvious practical value in having the Federal Court applying the same interest rate as would be applied in litigation in the same State in which the case is being heard. It would be undesirable for there to be distinctions drawn from State to State, depending on whether it was thought the regime in any particular State did or did not impose a commercial rate of interest."</text>

<tocase>Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria [1993] 2 VR 99</tocase>
<text>70 Lastly, the applicant referred to the decision of Gobbo J in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria [1993] 2 VR 99. His Honour found that Mason v New South Wales (at 105):
 
 "confirmed that a payment is made under duress or compulsion where there is a belief, on reasonable grounds, that non-payment will result in serious consequences such as interference with property rights or with the carrying on of a business . In the Air India Case , the test required the threat of a step, other than an invocation of legal process, which would cause harm to the payer." (emphasis added)

71 The applicant submits that it falls squarely within the test for duress and compulsion as formulated by Gobbo J.

72 The first respondent submits that the applicant has simply stated, in its pleading, that the retention of the overpaid rent would constitute "unjust enrichment". It contends that "unjust enrichment" is insufficient to give rise to a cause of action or an entitlement to refund the monies paid.</text>

<tocase>White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (1988) 156 ALR 169</tocase>
<text>154 The second respondent contends that it was improper to institute the deceit claim in the first place. It submits that the claim involved an allegation of criminality. As such, the claim should not have been made without proof to the Briginshaw standard: see White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (1988) 156 ALR 169 at 241.

155 In addition, the second respondent invites me to infer that the deceit claim was included for the "ulterior motive" of "poisoning" the Court against the respondents, or to bring pressure upon the respondents to settle. It submits that the deceit claim was very small, $12,000, compared to the overpaid rent claim, which was in the realm of $700,000. It contends that therefore, the claim was raised so as to discredit the respondents.

156 The third basis upon which the second respondent submits it is entitled to indemnity costs is by reason of the applicant's rejection of a settlement offer. In the 16 February 2004 letter, the second respondents' solicitors offered to settle the case on the basis that each side bear its own costs. The second respondent contends that the applicant was imprudent to reject this offer.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/69.html</AustLII>
<text>172 The insurmountable hurdle that the second respondent faces in relation to the hopeless case submission is that I rejected its application for summary dismissal of the case against it on 29 March 2004. In rejecting that application, I held that causation is a question of fact, and therefore I was unable at that stage to make a finding that the case was "clearly untenable", under the test laid down in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130. This was the requisite test for a summary dismissal at the time, although I note that this position has now changed as a result of an amendment made to the Federal Court Act by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth). Section 31A of the Federal Court Act now provides that the Court may summarily dismiss a matter where that matter has no reasonable prospect of success . The section expressly provides that a proceeding need not be "hopeless" or "bound to fail" for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.</text>

<tocase>Hughes v Western Australia Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 40-748</tocase>
<text>140 However, if I am minded to apportion costs, the applicant contends that I should take into account the approach of Toohey J in Hughes . In that case, although the applicant failed in the majority of causes of action it pleaded, it was awarded 75 per cent of its costs. His Honour did so on the basis that the applicant had "succeeded in his primary aim", and that the applicant "failed on some issues in circumstances where, not only should he not have the costs of those issues, but there should be some compensation for the respondents for the time taken in meeting those issues both prior to and at the hearing": see Hughes at 48,137.

141 The applicant in this case contends that in a majority of its claims it either succeeded or the issue was not determined. As the applicant acknowledged, however, I expressed serious misgivings about a number of its claims that were not, in a formal sense, finally determined.

142 The claim I did not express a view upon was the breach of good faith allegation. That claim was a true alternative to the challenge to the formal validity of the notice in the following sense. The applicant framed its claim for breach of good faith by contending that the more "generous" the requirements under the lease were for validity of notices, the more stringent the duty to act in good faith was. The converse of that submission is that the more stringently a notice is required to be construed, the less chance there is of finding a breach of good faith. Accordingly, because I found the notice to be invalid as a matter of form, at least one of the bases of the applicant's claim for the implication and breach of a duty of good faith fell away.

143 This fact assumes some importance because the applicant submits that a great deal of the evidence during the trial that went to the good faith claim, also went to its other claims. This includes the expert evidence. As such, the applicant submits that a significant amount of the evidence in the trial went to a claim that was not determined, and which I did not express any views upon.

144 In relation to the deceit claim issue, the applicant submits there should be no discount to its costs by virtue of it making, and maintaining until closing submissions, this claim. The deceit claim arose out of an internal email discovered by the second respondent relating to the "management fees" paid by the applicant in relation to the premises. That email stated:
 
 "Note on our file says "Tenant pays management fees of $462-50 (plus GST), half goes to owner half goes to Colliers Jardine' 
 
 Rent goes direct to owner, CJ's [Colliers Jardine] are involved so that owner can claim full management fees as an outgoing. " (emphasis added)</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/561.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The applicant relies upon the following passage from Lakatoi Universal Pty Ltd v LA Walker [2000] NSWSC 561 at [48] per Einstein J to support its objection to the grant of leave to file and serve an amended defence and cross-claim:
 
 "It is one thing for the court to case manage proceedings in terms of carrying out its best endeavours to ensure that unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings are avoided wherever possible. It is entirely another thing once a complex hearing extending over some 10 weeks is then followed by detailed findings on a multiplicity of issues binding all the parties, for one party then and only then, to seek to proceed against another party on a cross-claim, relying upon aspects of the judgment to sustain that claim."

25 The applicant contends allowing the first respondent to amend its pleading would result in the applicant being required to put on further evidence by way of defence. It says that it would raise an estoppel defence to the proposed cross-claim, and that would require evidence to be led as to the issue of reliance.

26 The applicant submits that I should take into consideration the fact that an application by it to amend its pleading was rejected in the primary proceeding on the basis that further evidence would need to be led by the respondents in answer the applicant's new claims, and I was not prepared to permit the case to be reopened. The applicant contends that the same approach should be taken to the first respondent's proposed cross-claim.</text>

<text>117 In relation to the appropriate interest rate to be applied, the applicant submits that the penalty interest rate, as specified in Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic), should be used to calculate interest in this case. It referred to my judgment in McCormick v Riverwood International (Australia) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 32 in support of that submission. In that case I applied the penalty interest rate after citing the following observations of Heerey J in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 (at 384): 
 
 "I think there is obvious practical value in having the Federal Court applying the same interest rate as would be applied in litigation in the same State in which the case is being heard. It would be undesirable for there to be distinctions drawn from State to State, depending on whether it was thought the regime in any particular State did or did not impose a commercial rate of interest."</text>

<tocase>McKay v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] 4 VR 677</tocase>
<text>65 The second case the applicant relies upon in relation to compulsion is McKay v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] 4 VR 677. The appellant in that case claimed he had made an "involuntary payment ... under unlawful compulsion within the principles enunciated in Mason v New South Wales ". Mason v New South Wales [1959] HCA 5 ; (1959) 102 CLR 108 is a case involving a claim for money had and received on the basis of compulsion.

66 In McKay , Winneke P stated as follows (at 686):
 
 "I venture to suggest that the legal doctrine of involuntary payments made under compulsion or coercion has no application to the facts of this case. That doctrine, in my view, is limited to circumstances where a party has been wrongfully compelled to make a payment demanded of him by an authority which, ex necessitate, he cannot resist. Compulsion leading to involuntary payment within the meaning of this doctrine, as I understand it, can only occur where the demand for payment is made under threat of immediate and empowered distress or seizure of the party's property or person so that the party is coerced into making the payment as a matter of necessity." (emphasis added)

67 The applicant submits Mr Allen's threats to evict come within the test for compulsion articulated by Winneke P.

68 The applicant also drew attention to the statement of Tadgell JA in McKay (at 689):
 
 "To act in response to pressure exerted by another will not be to act involuntarily and so to act under duress unless the pressure is fairly to be regarded by the law as unacceptable. A means of pressure or influence that the law will regard as unacceptable are various and indefinite and the categories are not closed."

69 During oral submissions, I raised the issue of whether compulsion can be found to have occurred where there was nothing to stop an applicant seeking injunctive relief. The applicant submits that the availability of injunctive relief to the party the subject of compulsion is irrelevant. It contends that this has to be so, as whenever a party has time to make a payment it also has time to seek an ex parte injunction. Any party the subject of a wrongful threat could always seek an injunction rather than pay the money over, and, accordingly, an action for money had a received by way of compulsion, at least in respect of threats to property, could never be made out.

83 In support of this submission, the first respondent relies upon the observation in McKay that the threat to issue legal proceedings or to pursue another legal remedy could "seldom be a wrong in itself". The Court in McKay said (at 690) that the "proper use of legal process does not constitute duress" and that "the threat to institute a civil action in good faith cannot constitute duress". It held, by analogy, that a "bona fide threat by a secured creditor to exercise rights conferred by the security can scarcely be relevantly different from a bona fide threat to sue". The first respondent contends that a bona fide threat by a landlord must fall into the same category.

84 Before turning to my specific findings, I wish to make some brief comments about the current position in Australia law with respect to restitutionary claims and "unjust enrichment".

85 Historically, what were described as the "common", "indebitatus" or "money" counts were generally seen as an appendage to the law of contract. The common counts included the action for money had and received, and other actions, such as for quantum meruit. The common counts were traditionally regarded as being based upon an implied contract theory. That is, they were based upon the implication of a contract which required the defendant to repay the plaintiff. Accordingly, the claims were described as "quasi-contractual". See Goff and Jones, The Law of Restitution (6 th ed, 2002) at [1-002]-[1-004] ("Goff and Jones") and K Mason and JW Carter, Restitution Law in Australia (1995) ("Mason and Carter") at [101]-[109]. Goff and Jones describe quasi-contract as "the most ancient and significant part of restitution" (at [1-001]).

89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.</text>

<tocase>Moses v Macferlan (1760) 97 ER 676</tocase>
<text>86 In the seminal case of Moses v Macferlan (1760) 97 ER 676, Lord Mansfield identified the specific, but non-exhaustive, instances where the action for money had and received lay. These were (at 681):
 
 "for money paid by mistake; or upon consideration which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition, (express, or implied); or extortion; or oppression; or an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to the laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances."

90 Roxborough is the most recent High Court case dealing with a claim for restitution. In that case, five out of six judges referred to the instances identified by Lord Mansfield in Moses v Macferlan where an action for money had and received was recognised to arise. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne J noted (at [15]) that Mason and Carter:
 
 "point out that cases decided in relation to the common indebitatus counts, although they involved an implied contract analysis which is now out of date "form the precedents which make up the legal matrix of restitution law"." (footnote omitted)</text>

<tocase>Ovidio v Carrideo Nominees Pty Ltd v The Dog Depot Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 6</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2006/6.html</AustLII>
<text>75 In support of its submission that it would be unjust to require the landlord to repay the overpaid rent, it referred to Ovidio v Carrideo Nominees Pty Ltd v The Dog Depot Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 6 , a recent decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal.

76 Ovidio involved the lease of retail premises. The parties had signed a lease on 14 August 2000. Section 8 of the Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 (Vic) provided that a prospective landlord must give a disclosure statement to the prospective tenant before entering into a lease. This was not done. Section 8 also provided that a failure to give a disclosure statement means "the tenant may withhold payment of rent until the end of 7 days after the landlord gives the tenant a copy of the disclosure statement" and "the tenant is not liable to pay the rent attributable to the period before the landlord gave the tenant a copy of the disclosure statement".

77 The landlord belatedly gave the tenant a disclosure statement on 5 May 2003. Up to this point, the tenant had been ignorant of its rights, and had been paying the rent pursuant to that lease. The tenant successfully brought an action in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ("VCAT") seeking restitution of the rent it had paid since entering into the lease, in its entirety. The landlord appealed VCAT's decision.

87 In Ovidio , Chernov JA referred to the history of the action for money had and received in the following terms (at [8]):
 
 "Historically, restitutionary relief was provided by courts of common law, although equitable principles played an important part in moulding the action. The basis of the claim for money had and received was articulated in the 18 th century by Lord Mansfield in Moses v. Macferlan . I will deal later with what his Lordship relevantly said in that regard, but for present purposes it is sufficient to mention what is said in the third edition of Bullen &amp; Leake's Precedents of Pleadings about the gist of the action, namely, that a claim for money had and received is "the most comprehensive of all common counts [and is] applicable wherever the defendant has received money which in justice and equity belongs to the plaintiff, under circumstances which render the receipt of it a receipt by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff."" (footnotes removed)

89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.

104 I also find the first respondent's reliance upon Ovidio in support of its claim that it would not be unjust for it to retain either all or part of the overpaid rent to be flawed. The present case is distinguishable from that of Ovidio on a number of grounds.

105 The most obvious point of distinction is that the landlord in Ovidio was found to have a counter-restitutionary claim against the tenant. Although the first respondent in this case submitted it also had a counter-restitutionary claim against the applicant, I do not see how such a claim could succeed. It must be remembered that in Ovideo , the effect of finding the tenant was entitled to restitution would have been that it would have had occupancy of the relevant premises for two and a half years for free. It was in this context that the Victorian Court of Appeal found the landlord would have a counter-restitutionary claim against the tenant for use and occupation of the premises.

106 Those facts are far removed from those in the present case. The parties in this case agreed to a tenancy on the terms set out in the lease. The tenant paid rent pursuant to that lease. The terms of the lease included that the rent be increased if the rental review procedures were followed (at least so far as clause 3.2.2 was concerned). Those procedures were not adhered to. Accordingly, in ordering that the applicant is entitled to restitution of the overpaid rent, the parties will actually get exactly what they bargained for under the terms of the lease, and the rent that the applicant has paid (minus the overpaid rent) constitutes good consideration for its tenancy. In those circumstances, it can hardly be said that the first respondent would have a claim against the applicant for use and occupation of the premises.

109 This finding is fortified when it is considered that, in Ovidio , when the Court came to determine the quantum of the counter-restitutionary claim, that is, what the "reasonable rent" was that the tenant should pay, their Honours had regard to what in fact the parties had bargained for. They did not themselves embark upon any independent assessment of the reasonable rent (although I acknowledge that there was no evidence before their Honours as to this matter). This demonstrates the inappropriateness of the Court deciding what a reasonable rental figure would be, when the parties have themselves agreed upon procedures to determine this.

110 For completeness, I note that even if I did seek to determine the "reasonable rent", I do not think averaging the four assessments tendered before me in evidence would be an appropriate way to determine objectively the correct figure. In such circumstances, the Court would have to determine that figure for itself, albeit with the assistance of the assessments available in the evidence.</text>

<tocase>Pasen v Buy-Rite Discounts Pty Ltd (1992) V ConvR |P54-431</tocase>
<text>41 The first respondent submits that as the annual rental increase provided for under the lease is automatic, it cannot relevantly be described as a "Rent Review". It relies upon Pasen v Buy-Rite Discounts Pty Ltd (1992) V ConvR |P54-431 in support of this submission. That case dealt with the issue of whether a provision in a lease was a "rent review clause" for the purposes of s 10 of the Retail Tenancies Act 1986 (Vic). It was held that a clause that automatically increased the rent over the term of the lease was not a "rent review clause" for the purposes of the legislation. Brooking J, with whom Marks and Smith JJ agreed, stated (at 65,091):
 
 "In my view, a lease which fixes the rent for the whole of the term by enabling the rent throughout the term to be ascertained from within the four corners of the lease does not, according to the ordinary use of language, provide for a review of the rent if it provides for an increase or increases or decrease or decreases in the rent in the course of the term, whether by way of simply stating the new amount or amounts or by way of requiring a calculation to arrive at the new amounts or amounts. The rent is fixed by the lease itself throughout the term and the lease in fixing different amounts is not providing for a review of the rent: it is simply fixing a rent which is not uniform throughout the term."

42 The first respondent noted Brooking J's use of the term "fix" and the use of that term in 3.2.1 in support of its submission that clause 3.2.1 does not provide for a "Rent Review"

43 Ultimately, the hurdle that the first respondent would face in relation to its preferred interpretation of the term "Review Date" is that this term is expressly defined at the beginning of clause 3.2. Whether the process provided for in clause 3.2.1 can objectively be described as a "rent review" seems to be immaterial to me. The question that would need to be resolved is not what the ordinary meaning of the term is, but rather what the parties intended it to mean in the context of the lease. When the lease itself expressly says what the meaning of the term is, regard must be had to that meaning.</text>

<tocase>Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul [1987] HCA 5 ; (1987) 162 CLR 221</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1987/5.html</AustLII>
<text>88 In Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul [1987] HCA 5 ; (1987) 162 CLR 221, the High Court rejected implied contract as the theoretical basis for claims in restitution. Instead, Deane J, with whom Mason and Wilson JJ generally agreed, stated (at 256-7):
 
 "unjust enrichment ... constitutes a unifying legal concept which explains why the law recognizes, in a variety of distinct categories of case , an obligation on the part of a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff and which assists in the determination, by ordinary processes of legal reasoning, of the question whether the law should, in justice, recognize such an obligation in a new or developing category of case ... " (emphasis added)

89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.

91 Despite Deane J's overture in Pavey &amp; Matthews that "unjust enrichment" assists in determining whether the law should recognise new categories of restitution, in David Securities , the majority (Mason CJ, Deane Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) noted that (at 379):
 
 "it is not legitimate to determine whether an enrichment is unjust by reference to some subjective evaluation of what is fair or unconscionable. Instead, recovery depends upon the existence of a qualifying or vitiating factor such as mistake, duress or illegality."

107 I do not accept the first respondent's "fall back" submission that I should determine what the "reasonable rent" would have been, and only order restitution of any amount that the applicant has paid over that sum. The amount by which it would have been "reasonable" to increase the rent is not relevant in these circumstances. As Deane J stated in Pavey &amp; Matthews (at 256), restitution does not provide "judicial discretion to do whatever idiosyncratic notions of what is fair and just might dictate".

108 The real question is what was the applicant was obliged to pay under the lease? While the applicant did make an offer to pay increased rent by reference to an independent assessment, the first respondent rejected that offer. It did so on the assumption that it was entitled to a higher rent. That assumption proved to be wrong. Accordingly, the agreement on foot between the parties provided that the rent payable was that which was paid, less the overpaid rent. The applicant, therefore, did not receive any additional benefit for its payment of the overpaid rent.</text>

<tocase>Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/68.html</AustLII>
<text>89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.

92 It is therefore clear from the High Court's approach in David Securities and Roxborough that while the categories of restitution are not closed, the "established categories" still provide, at the very least, the starting point for analysing restitutionary claims.

99 Nor do I consider as relevant the fact the applicant may be considered to achieve a "windfall" by reason of it receiving restitution of the overpaid rent. The High Court squarely faced this issue in Roxborough , and held that that fact did not prevent a claim in restitution.

100 Roxborough involved a claim for money had and received by retailers of tobacco products against the wholesaler of those products. The contracts of sale between the parties involved invoices that specified the wholesale price of the products and an additional fee representing an ad valorem license fee imposed by New South Wales state law. The license fee was subsequently held to be unconstitutional by virtue of it imposing an excise in contravention of s 90 of the Commonwealth Constitution . The retailers claimed sums equal to the amounts specified in the invoices as the "tobacco license fee", for approximately the month prior to the constitutional decision being handed down. These amounts had been paid by the retailers, but had been retained by the defendant and not paid to the New South Wales Government.

101 The retailers' claim was upheld by the High Court on the basis that there had been a failure of consideration. The failure in this case was described by Gummow J at [104] as "the failure to sustain itself of the state of affairs contemplated as a basis for the payments the appellants seek to recover". Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ described, at [19], the failure as "the failure of a severable part of the consideration for which the net total amounts shown on the invoices were paid".

102 In Roxborough , there was no suggestion that the retailers would pass on the remitted monies to its customers. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated (at [5]):
 
 "[i]n all probability, whoever succeeds in these proceedings will have made a windfall gain. In the absence of some legislative intervention, the appellants, if they succeed, are unlikely to be obliged to pass on the fruits of their success to the smokers who bore the financial burden of the invalid tax. For its part, the respondent has collected what was held to be a tax on goods, but it has not had to pay it over to the revenue authorities."

103 The Court went on to order repayment by the wholesaler to the retailers of the relevant monies, irrespective of the fact that this would provide the retailers with a "windfall" benefit.</text>

<text>160 Independent of its specific rebuttals of the second respondent's contentions, the applicant claims that the second respondent's conduct during the proceeding in relation to discovery should disentitle it to any award of indemnity costs. It relies upon the comments of Einfeld J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v First Netcom Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 656 , where his Honour stated (at 4):
 
 "... while it is certainly true that some unreasonable conduct on the part of the party against whom indemnity costs are sought must be demonstrated, it must equally be true that the party seeking the indemnity costs must come to the Court with clean hands."

161 The applicant contends that this extract is authority for the proposition that, when the Court exercises its discretion on costs, it takes into account the conduct of the parties

162 The particular conduct the applicant relies upon relates to a notice of motion heard by a Registrar of this Court on 10 September 2004. That notice of motion sought further discovery from the second respondent. The applicant had specifically requested, amongst other things, documents relating to Mr Williams' knowledge of sales and leasing markets for industrial premises similar to the subject premises. It filed the notice of motion having not received what it considered to be a satisfactory response to its request.

<tocase>United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904</tocase>
<text>19 In the primary judgment, I made the following comments in relation to this issue:
 
 "In determining what orders may be appropriate, the parties may wish to consider the applicability of the principles laid down in United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904 (" United Scientific Holdings ") in relation to the retrospective application of rent reviews completed outside the period provided for under the lease. 
 
 In United Scientific Holdings , the House of Lords held that there was nothing in that case that displaced the presumption that strict adherence to the timetables specified in the relevant rent review clauses was not of the essence of the contract. 
 
 There were in fact two separate cases decided in United Scientific Holdings . The first involved a rent review on a 99 year lease. The review was to occur each ten years after the commencement of the lease, with the new rent to commence on 31 August of that year. The rent review mechanisms provided that the revised rent was to be determined by agreement, or failing agreement, by arbitration "during the year immediately preceding" the 10 year period to which that rent would relate. By the end of the first 10 year period, such agreement had not been reached, and nor had the matter been referred to arbitration. 
 
 The second case involved a 21 year lease, commencing upon 8 April 1968. The rent was to be reviewed every seven years. The relevant machinery provided for the lessor to serve a notice on the lessee, and the lessee to serve a counter-notice accepting the proposal or making a counter-offer. The parties were then to negotiate. If agreement had not been reached after a certain time, the lessor was required to appoint an independent valuer. In this case, the lessor's notice was served within time. However, no agreement had been reached by the parties, and the lessor failed to appoint an independent valuer within the time provided for under the lease. 
 
 In both cases the House of Lords held that time was not of the essence in relation to the clauses in the leases which the lessors had not complied with. The lessors had not lost the opportunity to have the rent for the next rental period reviewed by virtue of not complying with the time periods set down in the rent review machinery clauses. 
 
 The potential significance of the case for this proceeding in terms of any final orders that may be made is as follows. The House of Lords held that once the relevant terms were complied with (namely an arbitration concluded in the first case and independent valuation conducted in the second case), the new rent would be payable from the date that the lease provided that the new rental period was to commence. That is, despite the lessors' tardiness, not only did they maintain their rights to rent reviews, but once the rent reviews were completed, the revised rent applied retrospectively as if those reviews had been completed on time."

20 The first respondent relies on United Scientific Holdings to assert that the further notice operates retrospectively back to 1 March 2003. To the extent that it is necessary, it seeks leave to file an amended defence and cross-claim so as to seek the appropriate declaratory relief to this effect. The declarations sought are that the further notice is valid, and that the rental for the period commencing 1 March 2003 is that which will be determined in accordance with the rent review machinery in the lease (namely the amount assessed as the proper rent by the independent third party).

21 The applicant objects to the Court granting the first respondent leave to file and serve an amended defence and cross-claim. It submits that it has informed the first respondent since early 2003 that it rejected the validity of the notice, yet the first respondent did not seek to protect its rights by issuing a provisional further notice. The applicant contends that the first respondent has provided no explanation as to why it did not take this course or plead the issue of its entitlement to do so.

22 The applicant submits that the first respondent is now seeking to implement the rent review machinery relating to independent third party assessment of the proper rent to be paid, despite having rejected the applicant's offer to take this course on 20 March 2003. At that time, the first respondent rejected the applicant's offer because the first respondent asserted it was entitled to the amount specified in the notice by reason of the applicant not objecting in time, and therefore the first respondent was not bound to submit to any third party assessment of the rent.

30 In addition to United Scientific Holdings , the first respondent relies upon the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in GR Mailman &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Wormald (Aust) Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 80 per Gleeson CJ as authority for the proposition that time is presumed not to be of the essence in relation to the right to invoke a rent review. These cases acknowledge that the presumption is rebuttable by sufficient "contra-indications" in the lease itself or the surrounding circumstances.</text>

<text>89 The recognition of a "unifying legal concept" does not, however, render the traditional categories of restitutionary claims, such as the action for money had and received, null and void. On the contrary, in recent years the High Court, and superior State courts, have chosen to frame claims in restitution within the bounds of these established categories. See Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516, Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344, David Securities , Pavey &amp; Matthews , Ovidio , McKay (referring to Mason v New South Wales ), and Vickery v JJP Custodians Pty Ltd (2002) 11 BPR 20,333.</text>
