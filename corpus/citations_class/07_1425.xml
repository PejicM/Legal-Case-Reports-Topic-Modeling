<tocase>Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/24.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In dealing with a situation where there was an award underpinning an individual contract of employment Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 421:
 
 'In a system of industrial regulation where some, but not all, of the incidents of an employment relationship are determined by award, it is plainly unnecessary that the contract of employment should provide for those matters already covered by the award. The contract may provide additional benefits, but cannot derogate from the terms and conditions imposed by the award and, ... the award operates with statutory force to secure those terms and conditions. Neither from the point of view of the employer nor the employee is there any need to convert those statutory rights and obligations to contractual rights and obligations. ...' (footnote omitted)

35 In his reasons for judgment Carr J said at [131]:
 
 '... As the High Court of Australia explained in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 420 421 an award imposes certain statutory terms and conditions which do not necessarily displace underlying common law contractual relations. If they conflict, the award or certified agreement may modify the contractual provisions, but otherwise they continue to co-exist. Byrne involved an award, but there does not seem to be any relevant distinction, for present purposes, between an award and a certified agreement. ...'

36 In the case of the 2007 Agreement it displaced a pre-reform certified agreement and provided what I have referred to as an 'underpinning' for the individual contracts of employment of Karellas' employees.

37 The applicant's concerns in relation to the approval of the 2007 Agreement arise from two publications put around by Karellas in the period 19 27 April 2007. The first document is four pages in length. It is on the letterhead of Karellas and addressed to 'Dear Employee'. It is dated 19 April 2007. On the second page it has been signed by a Peter Smith as 'Operations Manager'. The second document is three pages in length. It is also on the letterhead of Karellas and addressed to 'Dear Employee'. It also bears the signature of Mr Smith as 'Operations Manager'. It is undated.
 
 Copies of the two documents are attached to these reasons for judgment as appendices 'A' and 'B' respectively.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/8.html</AustLII>
<text>33 To like effect, Wilson J said in Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Proprietary Limited v Wardley [1980] HCA 8 ; (1980) 142 CLR 237 at 287 8:
 
 '... It will be seldom ... that an award will lend itself to the "covering the field" test of inconsistency on the subject of the contract of employment. Few, if any, awards reflect an intention to express completely, exhaustively or exclusively the law governing that contract between the parties. It will generally be a case of specific provisions which will, of course, have the effect of rendering inoperative any provisions of subordinate law, whether common law or statutory, touching that employment with which they are inconsistent. In Reg. v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd. Walters and Wells JJ., in a passage with which I respectfully agree, discuss the relationship of an award to the common law and to statute law and refer with approval to the following passage from Webb : Industrial Relations and the Contract of Employment ( 1974), p. 21: 
 
 
 
 "The significance of the common law can be recognised if contracts of employment are seen to be stratified. First there is a foundation strata being the common law. Superimposed on this are State Acts, regulations and State industrial determinations; in places such State law cuts through and replaces the common law foundational strata. Above this again are Commonwealth Acts, regulations and awards of the Arbitration Commission. Federal law cuts through State law in places, sometimes at the point where State law has already cut through common law, sometimes direct into common law."

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/303.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In relation to a pre-reform certified agreement serving as an underpinning instrument, such a situation was considered by a Full Court of this Court in Quickenden v O'Connor [2001] FCA 303 ; (2001) 109 FCR 243. At [69] Black CJ and French J said:
 
 'The broad brush complaint that common law contractual rights were displaced by the certified agreement faced another threshold issue. For while the agreement bound Dr Quickenden by force of law, it did not thereby terminate his contract of employment. It created rights and obligations which were statutory in character and could operate in addition to the rights and obligations under his contract and, where inconsistent, no doubt displace them. There is nothing in the agreement however which expressly sets aside or displaces the terms of existing or common law rights generally. The agreement itself is not, on the face of it, and is not expressed to be, exhaustive of the rights and duties of those bound by it. If anything it focuses upon the rights of employees, rather than their obligations.'</text>

<tocase>Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/75.html</AustLII>
<text>94 The applicant submitted that it may be inferred from the making of false or misleading statements in the four page document and/or the three page document that the making of the statements caused persons to whom the statements were made to approve the 2007 Agreement. In support of this submission reliance was placed upon certain statements of principle enunciated by Wilson J in Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236. Gould v Vaggelas was a case of fraud where Gould Holdings Pty Limited purchased the South Molle tourist resort from a number of companies associated with Vaggelas. Mr and Mrs Gould sought damages for deceit in respect of representations made to Mrs Gould that the business was very profitable, the Vaggelases having submitted false figures as to occupancy rates and financial returns. Wilson J summarised the relevant principles applicable to such a case as follows at 236:
 
 
 '1. Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the representee, before he entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on the representation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part even if only a minor part in contributing to the formation of the contract.'

95 His Honour proceeded to say at 238:
 
 '... Where a plaintiff shows that a defendant has made false statements to him intending thereby to induce him to enter into a contract and those statements are of such a nature as would be likely to provide such inducement and the plaintiff did in fact enter into that contract and thereby suffered damage and nothing more appears, common sense would demand the conclusion that the false representations played at least some part in inducing the plaintiff to enter into the contract.'

96 However, his Honour emphasised that the onus of proof rested on the plaintiff. At 238-239 he said:
 
 '... When all the facts are in, the fact-finding tribunal must determine whether or not it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the misrepresentations in question contributed to the plaintiff's entry into the contract. The onus to show that they did is a condition precedent to relief and rests at all times on the plaintiff.'

97 In my opinion, absent any evidence that the making of any false or misleading statement to another person or persons caused that other person or persons to vote to approve the 2007 Agreement, a 'fair inference of fact' that the making of the false or misleading statement or statements relied upon caused the person or persons to approve the 2007 Agreement would not be available. It is quite possible that, the causal link between the making of a false or misleading statement to another person or persons and the approval of, in this case, the 2007 Agreement by a majority of those persons who cast a valid vote deciding that they wanted to approve same, is missing because the employees of Karellas who cast valid votes indicating that they wanted to approve the agreement, did not even read the documents containing the false or misleading statements upon which the applicant has relied, let alone pay any regard to them.

98 It follows that the applicant's case for contravention of s 401(1) must fail.

99 Given the contravention of s 341(1) which has been found the Court has power under s 409(a) to declare the 2007 Agreement void, as the applicant would wish the Court to do, provided that a proper case for such an order was made out under s 412(2) of the Act.

100 By virtue of s 412(1) of the Act it is clear that an order declaring the 2007 Agreement 'void' would only take effect from the date of the order or a later date specified in the order.

101 In my opinion, an order declaring that the 2007 Agreement was void would not breathe new life into the 2003 Agreement as a pre-reform certified agreement. By virtue of clause 3(1) of Schedule 7 to the Act, when taken with clause 3(5), the 2003 Agreement ceased to be in operation when the 2007 Agreement was lodged with the Employment Advocate and once it ceased operating, it could not be revived. To use the words of clause 3(5) it could 'never operate again in relation to' Karellas' employees. This may seem a curious outcome. Nevertheless, s 347 of the Act made it clear that the 2007 Agreement came into operation on the day that it was lodged with the Employment Advocate and that it did so notwithstanding that, relevantly, the requirements of s 340(2)(a) had not been met in relation to it.

102 Had s 409(a) empowered the Court to make an order declaring the 2007 Agreement to be void ab initio, it certainly would have been a curious outcome to have the 2003 Agreement permanently displaced. But that is not what the legislature had in mind. Plainly, when one has regard to the terms of s 412(1) of the Act it is apparent that what the legislature intended was that from the date of the relevant order declaring the agreement void or a later date specified in that order, the relevant workplace agreement would cease to have any force and effect.</text>

<tocase>The State of Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/56.html</AustLII>
<text>103 In relation to the use of the word 'void' Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in The State of Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291 ('Victoria v Sutton') at [38]:
 
 'Windeyer J said of the term "void" that it "has never been an easy word" and pointed out that it did not necessarily mean that the void act had no legal effect at all. In particular, where ... a disposition between two parties is described as "void" at the will of a third, the preferred construction is to read "void" as "voidable". ...' (footnote omitted)

105 In Victoria v Sutton , Kirby J expounded upon the meaning of the word 'void' at [95] as follows:
 
 '... The word "void" is inherently ambiguous ... . It sometimes means that the act in question has not, and never has had, any legal effect (void ab initio). But sometimes it means that the act becomes void as against the world or against those who cannot enforce or take advantage of it subsequently (void ex post facto). "Void" is in some contexts treated as synonymous with "voidable" or voidable at the election of the party for whose benefit a legal rule makes the transaction void. The task of a court, in differentiating between the available meanings of the word, is to ascertain the objective of the lawmaker in the particular circumstances. It is to discover the meaning to be attributed to the word which is natural to its context. Many past cases demonstrate that the use of the word "void" presents a problem of statutory construction. There is no settled meaning.' (footnotes omitted)

106 In the foregoing circumstances the question arises as to whether the Court should exercise its discretion to declare the 2007 Agreement void. By virtue of s 412(2) of the Act the Court may exercise its discretion favourably to the applicant only to the extent that the Court considers appropriate to remedy the following:
 
 (a) all or part of any loss or damage resulting from the contravention by Karellas of s 341(1) of the Act; 

(b) prevention or reduction of all or part of that loss or damage.

107 The key words in s 412(2) are 'resulting from' the contravention.</text>

<tocase>Brooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd. [1969] HCA 4 ; (1969) 121 CLR 432</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1969/4.html</AustLII>
<text>104 The reference to the observations of Windeyer J were to his Honour's judgment in Brooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd. [1969] HCA 4 ; (1969) 121 CLR 432 at 458-459 where his Honour said:
 
 ' "Void", "Invalid", "Unenforceable".
 
 I have in this judgment used the words "invalid", "unenforceable" or "ineffectual", as, in similar cases, other judges have done. Other words and phrases can be used. For example, in the judgment under appeal the appellant's covenant is called "illegal and void". A similar promise was called by Asquith L.J. "void and unenforceable": Gaisberg v. Storr .... The words used do not matter if the actual legal result they are used to express be not in doubt or debate. But it has always seemed to me likely to lead to error, ... to adopt first one of the familiar legal adjectives - "illegal", "void", "unenforceable", "ineffectual", "nugatory" - and then having given an act a label, to deduce from that its results in law. That is to invert the order of inquiry, and by so doing to beg the question, and allow linguistics to determine legal rights. That need not happen if words be used, as Hobbes said that by wise men they should be, only as counters to reckon with; but reckoning becomes difficult if the values of counters are not constant. There may be no difficulty for adherents to Humpty Dumpty's principle as expounded by him to Alice. But his latitude and his command of his words as his servants are not generally allowed to lawyers. They are called upon to interpret other men's words. 
 
 The word "void" has never been an easy word, as is pointed out in the second Australian edition of Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract , p. 440. It is commonly said that when it describes a juristic act it means that it was always devoid of legal consequences. But this in itself is ambiguous, as witness the difference (which I have emphasized by italics) between the first edition of Sir George Paton's Text Book of Jurisprudence (1946) and the second edition (1951). In the first it was said (at p. 241) that "if the defects [of a juristic act] are such that the act has no legal effect at all , then the act is said to be void". The relevant passage in the latter edition (at p. 250) states - more accurately perhaps, and influenced probably by Professor Cohn's remarks in Law Quarterly Review, vol. 64 (1948), at pp. 325, 326- 
 
 
 
 "A defect may make a juristic act either void or voidable. If the defect is such that the act is devoid of the legal results contemplated then the act is said to be void. A void act is sometimes said to be a nullity in law, but this is not strictly so, as an act void in its primary intent may nevertheless have an effect in another way."' (footnote omitted)</text>

<tocase>Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky [1992] 39 FCR 31</tocase>
<text>111 The applicant relied upon the judgment of the Full Court in Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31 ('Demagogue') to support the proposition that 'loss or damage' did not have to be loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded. That may well be correct but Demagogue may be distinguished on the basis that it concerned misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act '), in the form of non-disclosure by a vendor of unusual features relating to access to land located at Noosa Heads in the State of Queensland, which the purchasers, who sought relief under s 87(1) and/or (1A) of the Trade Practices Act , acquired by entering into a contract which they would never have entered into had they been aware of the true position with regard to access to the site. The trial judge had clearly found a causal link between the misleading and deceptive conduct and the purchasers' entry into the contract (see per Black CJ at 33 and per Gummow J at 42).

112 Each of Black CJ, Gummow J and Cooper J found that the expression 'loss or damage' where used in s 87 of the Trade Practices Act , and which corresponded in many respects with s 412(2) of the Act in the present case, could include being saddled with an agreement which had been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct. At 33 Black CJ said:
 
 '... I consider it to be clear that the loss or damage contemplated by s 87(1A) is not limited to loss or damage in the s 82 [monetary damages] sense but was intended to include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract unconscionably induced. 
 ... 
 
 In my view, the loss or damage for the purposes of both ss 87(1) and 87(1A) will include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract induced by misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52. Proof of loss or damage of the sort that would be an "amount of ... loss or damage" for the purpose of s 82 is not a prerequisite for the grant of relief under either subsection.'

113 Gummow J, in his leading judgment, said at 42-43:
 
 'The phrase "loss or damage" appears in s 82 and in various subsections of s 87, particularly subss (1) and (1A). In my view, on this appeal nothing turns upon the circumstance that in a given case subs (1) may be attracted only by reason of the making of an application under s 82 to recover the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention in (sic) a provision of Pt IV or V. 
 
 Section 82 is concerned with the recovery of "the amount of the loss or damage" suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act. Section 87(1) requires that the court consider that its order will compensate "in whole or in part" for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage. Section 87(1A) requires that the orders concerned will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage suffered "or likely to be suffered", or will "prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered, or likely to be suffered ...". 
 
 Thus, whilst s 82 is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage, s 87 is concerned with compensation, whether in whole or in part, for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage, and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered. In the phrase "likely to be suffered", the word "likely" speaks of a "real chance or possibility": Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 261. 
 
 One significant distinction between ss 82 and 87 is the quia timet operation of s 87. On the appeal to the High Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 527 [Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said] : 
 
 
 
 "The Act draws a clear distinction in Pt VI between loss or damage which may be recovered under s 82 and the likelihood of loss or damage which may be prevented, or, if not prevented, reduced by one of the remedies under s 87." 
 
 
 
 Deane J said (at 850) that the statute in s 87 expressly distinguishes between the actual suffering of loss or damage and the likelihood (or contingency) that loss or damage will be suffered in the future. This emphasises that the phrase "the loss or damage", at least in s 87, may be concerned with more than pecuniary recovery as understood in the law of damages in tort; tort law postulates the commission, already accomplished, of a wrong: Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd v Slack [1924] AC 851 at 859, 868-869. 
 
 Further, unlike the position at general law with the administration of the equitable remedy of rescission of contracts, orders under s 87 may be made not only against parties to the contract but also against third parties, being persons involved (within the meaning of s 75B) in the contravention as a result of which the plaintiff entered into the contract: Lezam Pty Ltd v Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd ... at 304; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio ... at 714. 
 
 The respondents complain that they entered into a contract as the result of reliance upon conduct which contravened s 52. Why should they not be described as having suffered loss or damage, within the meaning of s 87, by that very reliance and entry into legal relations from which they otherwise would have abstained? If that contract be declared void ab initio as provided for in s 87(2)(a), will that not reduce this loss or damage?'

114 Cooper J also proceeded in Demagogue to expound upon the meaning of the phrase 'loss or damage'. At 44, Gummow J expressed his agreement with what Cooper J said in that regard. Cooper J's observations were recorded at 46-48 as follows:
 
 'Section 87 provides both the source of the court's power to provide a remedy and the remedy itself. It is therefore important to distinguish clearly between the need to establish the factual circumstances necessary to enliven the power of the court to grant relief and the circumstances which are relevant to the nature of the relief which it is appropriate to grant. 
 
 The circumstance in s 87(1) which empowers the court to grant relief is a finding that a party "has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of another person". That is a question of fact. 
 
 The words "loss or damage" where they appear in s 87(1) are to be construed by the application of the ordinary canons of statutory construction. This requires giving the words their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear. 
 
 The ordinary meaning of loss is "detriment or disadvantage resulting from deprivation or change of conditions" ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed (Revised), 1990) at 1241). "Damage" is defined as "1. Loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting estate, condition or circumstances (Arch) 2. Injury, harm". ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary at 485). 
 
 There are two matters within the context of s 87(1) which colour the meaning of the phrase in the section. The first is that the loss or damage has been or is likely to be caused by conduct in contravention of the Act. The second is that any order made is to compensate for the loss or damage. However, the compensation is not limited to the payment of a money sum or damages as an examination of s 87(2) discloses. Nor is there anything in s 87(2) which would limit the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered to pecuniary loss or damage. In particular, s 87(2)(a) (declaring a contract or collateral agreement to be void) and s 87(2)(ba) (refusing to enforce any or all provisions of a contract) take as their point of focus the denial of the benefit of a contract to a person whose proscribed conduct has caused loss or damage to the other party. Such an order has the consequential effect of releasing the innocent party from the obligations imposed by the contract. In the context of providing compensation it is the obligations imposed by such a contract which is the loss or damage which the order seeks to redress. 
 
 In my opinion "loss or damage" in s 87(1) means no more than the disadvantage which is suffered by a person as the result of the act or default of another ( Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed), Vol 12, par 1102) in the circumstances provided for in the section. 
 
 The phrase "loss or damage" in s 87(1) does not involve any concept of quantum or assessment of damages: see Barneys Blu-Crete Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union (1979) 43 FLR 463 at 473 where Northrop J expressed a similar view as to the use of the same phrase in s 45D(1)(a) of the Act. This is to be contrasted with the context of the phrase in s 82 where it is "the amount of the loss or damage" which is recoverable by action. For the purpose of s 82 it is the quantum or assessment of the loss or damage suffered in monetary terms which must be demonstrated. The rules as to the assessment of damages or the measure of damages in an action for deceit are relevant to the question of loss or damage under s 82. However those rules are not relevant to the meaning of the phrase in s 87(1). 
 
 The distinction between "loss or damage" and "the amount of the loss or damage" is reflected in the terms of section 4K of the Act. The section provides: 
 
 
 
 "In this Act 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a reference to loss or damage, other than a reference to the amount of any loss or damage, includes a reference to injury; and 
 
 (b) a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to damages in respect of an injury." 
 
 
 
 
 There are practical reasons why this should be so. The prima facie rule that the measure of damage in deceit is the difference between the value of the property and the price paid is inappropriate where the contract is not completed: Myers v Transpacific Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1986] ATPR 47,421 at 47,424. Where the contract remains unrescinded the costs associated with the conveyance of the property are costs arising out of the contract and of performing the obligations imposed thereby. Until the contract is rescinded such costs and expenses do not take on the character of costs and expenses thrown away and as such recoverable loss and damage under the general law. The court is not restricted in granting a remedy under s 87 by the limitations under the general law of a party's right to rescind for breach of contract or misrepresentation ( Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (1988) 79 ALR 83 at 102, 109). Likewise the limitations under the general law as to the assessment of damages and the measure of damage ought not be imported into a definition of "loss or damage" in s 87 to limit the category of actionable loss or damage. 
 
 To adopt a definition of "loss or damage" for the purpose of s 87(1) which includes the disadvantage of incurring contractual obligations that would not have been incurred but for the conduct complained of does not mean that the granting of a proper discretionary remedy necessarily leads to the setting aside of such a contract or to a refusal to enforce it according to its terms. That result will always depend upon the particular circumstances which exist when the occasion calls for an exercise of the powers under s 87 of the Act. ...'

115 The problem for the applicant and Ms Stringer in particular, in the present case, is that there is simply no evidence of any loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded, if otherwise appropriate and available, in her favour or in favour of any of Karellas' other employees. Nor is there any evidence that the approval, making and/or coming into operation of the 2007 Agreement resulted from the contravention by Karellas of s 341(1) of the Act.

116 Section 412(2) of the Act confines the Court's power to declare a workplace agreement void to those cases where the relevant loss or damage to be remedied, prevented or reduced is loss or damage 'resulting from' the relevant contravention. In order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s 341(1) of the Act and Karellas employees becoming saddled with the 2007 Agreement in this case, evidence would be required from employees of Karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by Karellas, they would not have voted as they did.

117 In the absence of any evidence on the issue, the Court may not make an order declaring the 2007 Agreement void. It is unnecessary, in the circumstances, to address the proper exercise of the Court's discretion to grant relief under s 409(a) of the Act were it otherwise able to do so.

118 In the foregoing circumstances, there should be a declaration that the employee collective agreement styled 'Karellas Investments Pty Ltd Employee Collective Agreement 2007' was not approved in accordance with s 340(2) of the Act. Otherwise, the Amended Application filed in Court on 23 May 2007 should be dismissed.

119 Given the terms of s 824 of the Act, there should be no order as to costs.
