<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1539.html</AustLII>
<text>There are unquestionably instances where an argument has been permitted to be raised on appeal even though " unequivocally disclaimed " before the primary judge: e.g. CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [30] to [35], 52 IPR 42 at 57 to 60. In the specific context of migration cases, leave to raise on appeal an argument abandoned before a Federal Magistrate may thus be permitted where (for example) there has been " an error of judgment by [an appellant's] counsel in abandoning a point which had originally been taken, and which was plainly viable ": White v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 232 at [35] , [2000] FCA 232 ; 96 FCR 511 at 519; SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 at [36] , [2007] FCA 765 ; 96 ALD 70 at 77.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/33.html</AustLII>
<text>The principles to be applied when exercising the discretion to entertain a ground different from those resolved by the trial judge are well settled. In Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ stated: 
 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. 
 

 
And in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7, Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed:
 
 
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.

In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 the grant of leave was thus addressed by reference to whether it was " expedient in the interests of justice " to grant leave. Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ there concluded (citations omitted): 
 
 [46] In our view, the application for leave to rely upon the sole ground of appeal now raised should be refused. Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ... 
 

 
Their Honours referred to Coulton [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 and continued:
 
 
 [48] The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters. The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. In our view, the proposed ground of appeal has no merit. There is no justification, therefore, for permitting it to be raised for the first time before this Court.

<tocase>Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1788.html</AustLII>
<text>In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J was confronted with an application for leave to amend a Notice of Appeal and an application to adduce further evidence, being the transcript of the proceeding before the Tribunal. In refusing leave to amend, His Honour referred to those principles relevant to the grant of leave to raise new grounds on appeal but further observed (in part): 
 
 [21] Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act. All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court. Parliament has provided for a right of appeal to this Court and in matters of this kind the appellate jurisdiction of this Court may be exercised by a single Judge: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Indeed, that is the case on this appeal.
 ...
 [24] The appellate process is to correct error. If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court. That is undesirable. It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court. If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court, the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed. That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court's point of view. 
 

 
 
 [25] Moreover, to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court. 
 

 
 
 [26] Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43. 
 

 
These observations of His Honour were recently endorsed by Spender J in SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 598 at [11] .

And in Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 , Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ also observed: 
 
 [24] ... in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised. That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds. To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless. It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success. We also consider it appropriate to take into account whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the hearing before the primary judge.

In the present proceeding the Federal Magistrate has in fact gone on to express brief " views " as to those arguments which were at least embraced by the Grounds set forth in the Application as initially filed. To that extent, this Court has had the benefit of the obiter views helpfully expressed by the Federal Magistrate. In addressing these further Grounds , the Federal Magistrate concluded (in summary form): 
(i) Procedural fairness : There was held to be no denial of procedural fairness. The now Appellant was said to have been given an opportunity of being heard in respect to the adverse conclusions as made by the Tribunal, and those adverse conclusions were held to have been made in reliance on the now Appellant's own evidence.
 
(ii) Jurisdictional error : The Federal Magistrate observed that " no particulars " of this Ground were provided. To the extent that a challenge was made to the manner in which the Tribunal reached its state of " satisfaction ", the Federal Magistrate observed that the Tribunal was " not required to uncritically accept any, or all, of the applicant's claims ".
 
(iii) The decision was "unjust" : In respect to this Ground the Federal Magistrate observed that no jurisdictional error was exposed as " [t]he Tribunal's findings were open to it on what was before it ". It was further observed that " [t]he Tribunal gave cogent reasons in support of its findings ".
 
(iv) A failure to consider an aspect of the claim : This Ground was rejected by the Federal Magistrate upon the basis that the Tribunal did consider the claim advanced. " At best ", the Federal Magistrate observed, the Ground was " an assertion that the applicant meets the definition of "refugee" as set out in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention ".
 
(v) A failure to investigate and "actual bias" : The Federal Magistrate rejected a contention that there was a " general duty to inquire " and further concluded that there was " nothing before the Court to suggest bias, or the apprehension of bias, on the part of the Tribunal ...".
 
No appellable error is exposed in these conclusions of the Federal Magistrate &#8212; even if leave is to be granted to raise the matter addressed as Grounds of Appeal .

The final Ground of Appeal that the Appellant seeks to raise, Ground 7 in the Notice of Appeal , was not raised at any stage of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrate. The Ground does not make sense, even allowing for the fact it may have been drafted by someone whose native language is not English. For this reason, this Ground too has no prospects of success.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/149.html</AustLII>
<text>Consideration of those factors relevant to an informed decision being made to abandon an argument in circumstances more apposite to civil litigation in which litigants are well-represented may assume little (if any) importance in an appeal such as the present. But some significance, it is considered, is nevertheless to be given to even an ill-informed unrepresented litigant apparently abandoning an argument otherwise available to him and thereafter seeking to resurrect on appeal the very same argument. The " interests of justice ", it is to be recalled, encompass the interests of both the unrepresented Appellant and the interests of the Respondents to an appeal. An unconstrained freedom on the part of an unrepresented Appellant to pursue all such arguments as may advance his own interests may well be inconsistent with the interests of a respondent or the more generally expressed public interest in the orderly administration of justice. An absence of prejudice claimed by a respondent may not be a sufficient reason to allow an argument to be raised for the first time on appeal: e.g. NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [23] to [33] [2008] FCA 149 ; , 100 ALD 118 at 128.

In considering whether leave should be given to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal it is also relevant to give attention to the apparent merits of the argument sought to be raised.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/886.html</AustLII>
<text>In the present proceeding, three considerations (at least) warrant attention, namely: to raise on appeal grounds not previously relied upon requires the leave of the Court; the role of this Court as an appellate court and the role that this Court plays in respect to any subsequent application that may be made to appeal to the High Court of Australia; and relevant to the grant or refusal of leave are various factors, including the fact that a ground sought to be raised was previously abandoned. 
Although these three considerations may be separately identified, consideration of any one of them may well overlap with consideration of another. Each of these considerations has also been repeatedly addressed in decisions of this Court &#8212; but some brief overview of these considerations is perhaps appropriate, lest the Appellant be left with the impression that his appeal has been dismissed on a " technicality " divorced from principle or merit. It is in that context that a fourth consideration should also be addressed, namely:
 the merit of the new grounds sought to be raised. 
The serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may also be taken into account when determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice that leave be given: SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [16] per Branson J. The serious consequences that attend the refusal of leave to raise a new ground in any appeal is, however, a matter warranting careful consideration and migration cases &#8212; it is considered &#8212; attract no different consideration: cf SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [9] .</text>

<text>In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J was confronted with an application for leave to amend a Notice of Appeal and an application to adduce further evidence, being the transcript of the proceeding before the Tribunal. In refusing leave to amend, His Honour referred to those principles relevant to the grant of leave to raise new grounds on appeal but further observed (in part): 
 
 [21] Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act. All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court. Parliament has provided for a right of appeal to this Court and in matters of this kind the appellate jurisdiction of this Court may be exercised by a single Judge: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Indeed, that is the case on this appeal.
 ...

It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court.

If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court. 
 

 
 
 [26] Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43.

<text>In SZLWE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1343 , Perram J reviewed some of these different outcomes as follows: 
 
 [19] It is then useful to say something about the Tribunal's confusion of the Appellant's membership of the Lebanese forces with membership of the Lebanese Armed Forces. In the Appellant's amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court such a claim was expressly included. However, at the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court the Appellant, who was represented by counsel, abandoned that argument. There may be some circumstances in which an appellate court will permit a party who has expressly abandoned a point at trial to raise it afresh on appeal. Gyles J would have permitted such a course in Dovuro v Wilkins [2000] FCA 1902 ; (2000) 105 FCR 476 at 527 [181] at least where the point involved no prejudice to the other party. Branson and Finkelstein JJ took the opposite view: 487 488 [38] and 508 509 [119] [120]. There may be something to be said for the view that where a point is expressly abandoned that the doctrine of waiver is relevant to the question: cf. Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67 at 75 per Lord Halsbury, 80 per Lord Bowen; applied by the Privy Council in Yorkshire Insurance Co v Craine [1922] 2 AC 541 at 552 553 per Lords Buckmaster, Atkinson, Sumner, Parmoor and Wrenbury. If that were so, the question of whether an appellate court should entertain a fresh ground might not be relevant &#8212; there might be no ground to raise. However, whether the question is posed as one about the circumstances in which an appellate court should permit a point abandoned below to be resurrected on appeal, or, instead, one of waiver leading to the conclusion that the point no longer juridically exists &#8212; the outcome is the same in this case. I would not permit the abandoned ground to be entertained. 
 

 
It is not necessary in the present appeal to pursue His Honour's views as to the possible application of the doctrine of waiver.</text>

 [26] Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43.

<text>On 25 September 2009, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the Application: SZNSC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 945. In dismissing the Application , the Federal Magistrate not only resolved the remaining Ground ; he also considered the five Grounds as originally expressed in the Application as initially filed. The Federal Magistrate further concluded that none of these Grounds " were of any assistance to [the Applicant] ": [2009] FMCA 945 at [97] .

A Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 13 October 2009. The Grounds of Appeal were there set forth as follows (without alteration): 
 
 1) The decision of Respondent is effected by the jurisdictional error by failing to assess or carry out the 'real chance' test, before dismissing appellant claims that respondent failed to analyse properly the "future harm" appellant may face if he go back to Pakistan. 
 

 
 
 2) The appellant satisfy the four key elements of the Convention definition as detailed in page 2 and 3 of the respondent 1 decision. Respondent has not consider this aspect and therefore committed factual and legal error. 
 

 
 
 3) The respondent has failed to investigate application claim specially the grounds of persecution in Pakistan. Therefore the Respondent decision dated 6-6-2009 was effected by actual bias constituting jurisdictional error. 
 

 
 
 4) The Respondent decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of appellant circumstances and the consequence of the claim. 
 

 
 
 5) The respondent denied the appellant procedural fairness by reaching adverse conclusion the appellant was not a witness of truth being conclusion the were not obviously open on the known material, without giving the appellant opportunity to be heard in respect of those matters. 
 

 
 
 6) The respondent had no jurisdiction to make the said decision because its 'reasonable satisfaction' was not arrived in accordance with the requirement of the Migration Act. 
 

 
 
 7) In term of order case the Respondents said that there is no basis to proof characteristic against Appellant, there is no basis of this as such the Respondent made an error in making this decision.

The Grounds of Appeal , it will be noticed, have much in common with the Grounds upon which the Application was initially sought to be advanced before the Federal Magistrate &#8212; but abandoned or, at least, not pressed &#8212; and little (if anything) in common with the sole Ground which was ultimately advanced for resolution before the Federal Magistrate.</text>

<text>In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 the grant of leave was thus addressed by reference to whether it was " expedient in the interests of justice " to grant leave. Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ there concluded (citations omitted): 
 
 [46] In our view, the application for leave to rely upon the sole ground of appeal now raised should be refused. Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ... 
 

 
Their Honours referred to Coulton [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 and continued:
 
 
 [48] The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters. The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. In our view, the proposed ground of appeal has no merit. There is no justification, therefore, for permitting it to be raised for the first time before this Court.

Differing factors have been identified in respect to whether a ground which has been expressly abandoned at first instance should later be permitted to be " resurrected " on appeal.</text>

<text>There are unquestionably instances where an argument has been permitted to be raised on appeal even though " unequivocally disclaimed " before the primary judge: e.g. CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [30] to [35], 52 IPR 42 at 57 to 60. In the specific context of migration cases, leave to raise on appeal an argument abandoned before a Federal Magistrate may thus be permitted where (for example) there has been " an error of judgment by [an appellant's] counsel in abandoning a point which had originally been taken, and which was plainly viable ": White v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 232 at [35] , [2000] FCA 232 ; 96 FCR 511 at 519; SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 at [36] , [2007] FCA 765 ; 96 ALD 70 at 77.</text>
