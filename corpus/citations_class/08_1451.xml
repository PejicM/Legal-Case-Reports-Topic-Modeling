<text>26 For completeness reference might also be made to a decision given in this Court's original jurisdiction by R.D. Nicholson J, Daniel v Western Australia [1999] FCA 1541 ; (1999) 94 FCR 537 at 541 - 542 in para 25 and para 26, his Honour observed:
 The communications in issue are principally communications from some of the first applicants. As I have said, however, there are possibly some communications from the second applicants and the third applicants and I've already stated that in the event of these being identified, if a privilege is found to exist, those parties should be given the opportunity to decide whether to make a claim and support it with argument. If there are communications to Mr Robinson by persons other than any of the applicants, that is persons other than any client, there is no basis for a client based privilege.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/67.html</AustLII>
<text>12 In Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at 59, para 16, Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ observed of these sections as follows in their joint judgment:
 Those sections appear in chapter 3 (sections 55 to 139 ) of the Act which, say for presently immaterial exceptions, is concerned with the admissibility of evidence. This limitation in the language of the statutory provisions was noted and was essential to the decision of this Court in Northern Territory v GPAO. The explanation of the wording of the Act is set out above. The statutory language is clear. It deals with the adducing of evidence. That would cover adducing evidence in interlocutory proceedings as well as at a final hearing or on an appeal but it does not cover all the circumstances in which a claim for privilege might arise. To take the most obvious example, it would not cover the circumstances considered in Baker v Campbell.

13 Neither, for the reasons given in para 59, does it cover the situation in respect of documents which are produced on subpoena, save in that circumstance when such a document is sought to be adduced in evidence. That is not this case at the present. That is not to say that documents produced on subpoena may not be the subject of a claim by a party entitled to claim legal professional privilege, but the foundation for such a claim must be that privilege as it is known at common law, not as provided for in s 118 and s 119 of the Evidence Act 1995 .

14 Granitgard has challenged the claim made by Termicide insofar as the claim relates to communications between third parties, in other words, where the documents did not emanate either from the Respondents or its lawyers. Three particular types or class of document have been identified by way of example: 
 
1. documents produced by Dr French as referred to in Termicide's solicitor's letter dated 31 July 2008, being communications passing between Dr French and Dr Ahmed; 
 
2. documents produced by Dr Ahmed as referred to in Termicide's solicitor's letter dated 31 July 2008, being communications passing between Dr Ahmed and Dr French; and 
 
3. documents produced by a Mr Langley as referred to in Termicide's solicitor's letter dated 20 August 2008, being communications passing between "experts".

25 Though reported in the authorised reports in 1999, the Interchase case was decided in 1997, that is prior to the decision of the High Court in Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation . Thus, that explains the reference by their Honours to a sole purpose test. The later decided Esso Australia Resources case holds that for Australia the test at common law for legal professional privilege in relation to documents is whether a communication was made or a document was prepared for the dominant purpose of a lawyer providing legal advice or legal services. Subject to that necessary qualification, the discussion of principle in the Interchase case is compelling.</text>

<tocase>Interchase Corporation Limited (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) (1999) 1 Qd R 141</tocase>
<text>15 It is convenient to consider the fate of the application, given its focus, by reference to the question as to whether at common law legal professional privilege can attend communications passing between experts or documents produced to experts for the purposes of providing an expert opinion. Authoritative guidance to the resolution of such a question is provided in the judgments delivered by Pincus JA and Thomas J, with each of whose judgments de Jersey J (as the Chief Justice then was) agreed, in Interchase Corporation Limited (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) (1999) 1 Qd R 141. Suffice it to say, that case was decided in respect of a similar controversy in respect of legal professional privilege.

16 After a very searching analysis of prior authority, the view reached by Pincus JA at page 148 was that:
 The principle which emerges from these cases is that documents used by an expert to form an opinion are not the subject of legal professional privilege whether or not they emanated from the party claiming privilege.

17 There were five categories of document which were controversial and the subject of privilege claim in the Interchase case. They are set out in a table which appears at page 150 of the reasons for judgment of Pincus JA. That table was in the following terms: 
 Date Document Description Various

A Letters, facsimiles and enclosures passing between Feez Ruthning as solicitors for the plaintiff and
Richard Ellis regarding the Retrospective Valuation, numbered 1 to 12 inclusive, contained in a folder marked with the letter 'A' and entitled 'Richard Ellis -- Writ of Non-Party Discovery'. Undated

B Drafts of various parts of the Retrospective Valuation prepared by Richard Ellis, numbered 13 38
inclusive, contained in a folder marked with the letter 'B' and entitled 'Richard Ellis -- Writ of Non-Party Discovery'. Undated

C Working papers produced by Brian Cox of Richard Ellis in the course of preparing the Retrospective Valuation, including copies of schedules, plans and
other documents on which Brian Cox has made written calculations and notes, numbered 39 to 87 inclusive, contained in a folder marked with the letter 'C' and entitled 'Richard Ellis -- Writ of Non-Party Discovery'. Various

D Copies of extracts from other Richard Ellis valuations of various properties (other than the Myer Centre) selectively collated and copied by Brian Cox of
Richard Ellis for use in the preparation of the Retrospective Valuation, numbered 88 137 inclusive, contained in a folder marked with the letter 'D' and entitled 'Richard Ellis -- Writ of Non-Party Discovery'. Various

E Copies of various other documents selectively collated and copied by Brian Cox from Richard Ellis for use in the preparation of the Retrospective
Valuation, numbered 138 149 inclusive, contained in a folder marked with the letter 'E' and entitled 'Richard Ellis -- Writ of Non-Party Discovery'

18 Later on page 150, Pincus JA observed that it appeared to him that, prima facie, one would hold, following English authority, that documents within categories B, C, D and E were not privileged. As his Honour observed there:
 They are documents of various kinds used in preparing a witness's opinion, none of them obtained from Interchase's solicitors.

19 His Honour further observed that the documents in category A raised different considerations. In respect of that category his Honour stated as follows at page 151:
 The affidavit asserts that they are communications which passed between the Interchase solicitors and Richard Ellis after the action began "for the sole purpose of giving legal advice in relation to, or obtaining evidence to be used in, this litigation". The only question to which acceptance of the English position would give rise, as to category A, is whether it includes documents not in origin privileged, but used by the expert in forming an opinion; on the basis of the English cases, such documents would not be privileged, although supplied by the solicitor to assist in the expert's work. There is concealed in this issue a problem about the way in which a judge should proceed in considering the validity of a claim of privilege. Even if each document is precisely identified, it may not be possible to reach, merely from their description, a definitive conclusion on the validity of the claim with respect to each document; sometimes it may be that a sampling process may usefully be engaged in by the judge, to determine the credibility of a privilege claim designed to protect a large quantity of material; I do not accept that the judge must examine either all of the documents in question, or none of them. For practical reasons, it appears to me that the judge will ordinarily deal with challenged claims of privilege in accordance with categories, rather than individual documents.

20 That presents a difficulty in this case, if only in the sense that the privilege claim advanced on behalf of Termicide is, to put it charitably, of the most general in its description of the documents covered by the asserted claim. Later in his judgment in Interchase , Pincus JA considered whether the position which he thought obtained in light of English authority ought to be in any way altered or varied in light of authority in this country. Suffice it to say, his Honour did not consider that Australian authority compelled any different conclusion. In respect of letters of instruction to experts, his Honour observed at page 156 that:
 Unless the letter of instruction, improbably, gave the valuer some confidential instruction as to the desired content of the report it is difficult to understand what in the letter of instruction could be really confidential.

21 The view to which his Honour came, ultimately, was that documents in category A, being those passing between the plaintiff's solicitors and the valuer they engaged, relating to the valuation, are privileged, but the documents in categories B, C, D and E, being those which were brought into existence or were obtained by the valuer to assist in the preparation of the valuation report, were not privileged. His Honour's conclusion was that "witness document privilege" did not exist. In his separate reasons for judgment, Thomas J observed at page 160, in his discussion under the heading Application of the General Law as follows:
 The documents in categories A to E above are therefore subject to the general principles applicable to legal professional privilege. The question is whether they are properly protected from disclosure. The rationale of the protection of legal professional privilege is a perceived need to protect the confidences between clients and their legal advisers (Grant v. Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 C.L.R. 674 , 685; Australian Federal Police v. Propend Finance [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 C.L.R. 501 , 551-552). Although marginal cases constantly arise, the courts have succeeded in identifying appropriate limits to the confidentiality of communications in dealings between client and solicitor. However more complex factors arise when the solicitor finds it expedient to enlist the assistance of other persons. In this context an expert is a third person from whom the client, represented by a solicitor, hopes to obtain an advantage. The extent of protection applying to communications between the solicitor and the expert concerning alleged facts or hypotheses which the expert is asked to assume is, I think, a grey area. The solicitor is deliberately converting the expert into a witness. The community has some interest in ultimately being able to ensure (through the courts) that this process is not abused. It is desirable that the rules be such that the courts, or the adversary, be able to explore fairly fully the circumstances of the formation of the opinion. It is also necessary in some cases to explore the circumstances and nature of the retainer. However, to the extent that communications of this kind (commonly called "instructions") are made solely for the purpose of use in litigation and are intended to be confidential, such instructions are generally thought to enjoy protection.

22 A little later, at pages 160 to 161, Thomas J continued:
 Whatever the limits of protection of the communications (both ways) between the solicitor and the third party may be, it is difficult to see any justification in principle or policy for protection of documents which the expert generates and the information which he or she collects in order to form an opinion. The important principle that there is no property in a witness means that an adversary party may subpoena an expert retained by the original party and require that expert to give all relevant information in his possession, including an expression of his opinion, to the court. It is perhaps curious that statements made by a plaintiff to, say, a doctor or engineer are not privileged, while similar or dissimilar statements made to such persons on the plaintiff's behalf by the plaintiff's agent, the solicitor, are. It is difficult to draw a tidy dividing line between the opinion and "the instruction" because the opinion of the expert is commonly premised on facts supplied by that means.

23 I interpolate that his Honour's observation in respect of the subpoena process is particularly germane in this case. Later, at page 161, his Honour observed:
 In the field of expert evidence it is difficult to sever an opinion from the information and process upon which it is based. It would seriously jeopardise the proper testing of such witnesses if privilege were extended to documents of the kind which are described in categories B, C, D and E in the present case.

24 Finally, at page 162, his Honour made the following statement by way of summative conclusion:
 I would hold that in general, when an expert is engaged by a solicitor for the purpose of giving evidence in a case, documents generated by the expert and information recorded in one form or another by the expert in the course of forming an opinion are not a proper subject for a claim of legal professional privilege. Privilege may however be claimed in relation to communications between the expert and the solicitor (both ways) when such communication is made for the purpose of confidential use in the litigation. Beyond this there is no sufficient reason why any material relevant to the formation of the expert's opinion should be subject to a claim of legal professional privilege. It is as well to add that an expert or solicitor may not artificially manufacture privilege by, for example, the expert sending in his or her file to the solicitor. Documents of this kind simply are not confidential.

25 Though reported in the authorised reports in 1999, the Interchase case was decided in 1997, that is prior to the decision of the High Court in Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation . Thus, that explains the reference by their Honours to a sole purpose test. The later decided Esso Australia Resources case holds that for Australia the test at common law for legal professional privilege in relation to documents is whether a communication was made or a document was prepared for the dominant purpose of a lawyer providing legal advice or legal services. Subject to that necessary qualification, the discussion of principle in the Interchase case is compelling.

27 Though brief, it is evident from his Honour's observation that, at least in respect of the communications to Mr Robinson in that case, he was of a similar view to that which is evident in the reasons for judgment of Pincus JA and Thomas J in the Interchase case. Thus, a pervasive claim or a blanket claim for privilege in respect of the documents produced on subpoena does not seem to be warranted. Indeed, there is every likelihood that it greatly overstates the basis upon which privilege might validly be claimed. The question becomes how best to deal with the question of privilege if any attaching to documents which have been produced on subpoena?

28 In the first instance, it would be a misuse of judicial resources for me to examine each and every document produced on subpoena to the end of determining whether privilege ought to be claimed. This task was nonetheless one which I was urged to undertake by Granitgard. I do not propose to undertake that task in the first instance. Instead, it seems to me that Termicide ought to do what a counsel of perfection might suggest it should have done before asserting a privilege claim to start with. In other words, it ought to identify with precision, seriatim, each and every document in respect of the subpoenaed documents, in respect of which a claim for privilege is pressed.

29 In so doing it will now have the benefit of the Court's reasons for judgment as to categories, in respect of which privilege is and is not available. It is unfortunate that Granitgard has had to bring such an application, but it having been brought, there ought to be relief granted to enable it to access documents in respect of which there is no basis for the making of a privilege claim. Further, the party which has asserted privilege, Termicide, needs to approach the task of identifying, with precision, documents in respect of which the claim is maintained with considerable expedition, given that the case is presently fixed for trial on 20 October 2008.</text>

5 By a letter dated 30 April 2008, Granitgard, by its solicitors, identified 29 types of document in respect of which it was alleged that Termicide's discovery was deficient. A response to that letter was made on behalf of Termicide by its solicitors on 16 May 2008. That response conveniently tabulates the impugned types of document, together with the response made on behalf of Termicide in respect of those documents which is outlined below:
 
 Applicant's Request of 30 April 2008 Status 1 The termiglass specification referred to in CSIRO appraisal No further documentation to be discovered 2 The summary of particle density dated 10 July 2003 referred to in letter from Vision Glass Recycling dated 11 July 2003 (document 1) This has already been discovered as part of document 17 3 All correspondence and documents provided to Dr French as referred to in Dr French's facsimile dated 5 November 2003 (document 5) There were no documents or correspondence referred to in Dr French's facsimile.

No further documentation to be discovered. 
6 In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Limited (2005) 221 ALR 785 at 799, paragraph 25 Greenwood J observed as follows:
 Order 15 r 8 seems to embody the following process. A party dissatisfied with the completeness of discovery by another party might seek to identify either a document or class of document as the focus for an application. That document or class of document must relate to a matter in question in the proceeding. The grounds for a belief that some document or class of documents relating to a matter in question exists can be demonstrated to the court either from the evidence adduced by the applicant for an order or from the nature or circumstances of the case (reflected in the pleadings) or from any document filed in the proceedings. The applicant must then demonstrate that such a document or class of document either may be, or may have been, in the possession, custody or power of a party. Once those matters are demonstrated, the court may order such a party to file an affidavit stating whether that document or any document of that class is or has been in the possession, custody or power of the party. 
7 On behalf of Granitgard, it is submitted that a good litmus test of Termicide's failure to address its duties as to discovery appears from a letter from its solicitors dated 27 August 2008. In that letter Termicide's solicitors identified and attached an email which, it was conceded, had been the subject of a claim for privilege, and which, it was conceded, ought not to have been subject to such a claim. The email concerned had two enclosures. When they were sought by Granitgard, the response made by the solicitors for Termicide was that:
 Both of the documents referred to in that email are available in the material provided by the subpoenaed parties. 
8 Whilst that particular response might, with all due respect, be regarded as churlish, it does not at all follow that the further disclosure of the email, which, upon reflection, was regarded as not attracting a claim on behalf of Termicide for legal professional privilege, is in any way indicative a failure to observe discovery obligations. To the contrary, it shows an attention to the ongoing responsibilities that attend such an obligation.

9 To use the litmus test analogy favoured by Granitgard, it seems to me, on the material, that Granitgard's application is motivated by an unfortunate acidity in relations not just between the parties but between those who represent them, whereas, on a more objective analysis, the fact of voluntary further disclosure is alkaline in its character. By that I mean there is a quite benign view that one can take of that, which is that of a party, by its solicitors, taking care to observe a discovery obligation notwithstanding a position earlier taken and as soon as it is realised that that earlier position was taken in error. The discovery that was ordered by me on 15 February 2008 was by categories, not general. It is quite apparent from the letter sent in response to Granitgard's letter of 30 April 2008 that there has been reflective consideration by Termicide and those advising it of the adequacy of discovery in respect of the categories of discovery ordered. Having regard to the responses which were made and usefully summarised in the table, it seems to me that there ought not to be any order for further discovery. That is so even if, perchance, strictly, some of the documents identified in the 29 types or categories of document might have at one stage or another existed.

10 Further, I do not see any particular utility in requiring Termicide to verify on oath that which its solicitors have made on its behalf by way of response in that table. The response seems to me to be a complete answer to the request that was made. The application for further discovery, in any event, would enliven a discretion and, as I have indicated, even if, strictly, some documents may or may not at one stage have existed within those 29 classes of document, I am not disposed at this stage of the proceedings to order further discovery by Termicide of those on the basis of the material with which I have been provided for the purposes of hearing the application. And that is an alternative position; the primary one being it seemed to me that the responses made were a complete answer. The application for further and better discovery will therefore be dismissed.</text>
