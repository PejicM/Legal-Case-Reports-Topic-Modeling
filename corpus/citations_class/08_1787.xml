<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Patcorp Investments Ltd (1973) 140 CLR 247</tocase>
<text>45 The taxpayer submitted that the shares were issued when Nominees and Mr Handbury "were entitled as against the company to be registered", citing Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Patcorp Investments Ltd (1973) 140 CLR 247 at 303. The taxpayer said that "[t]hat point was the point at which the allotment consideration was provided and the contract was executed on their part, that is, the point at which the debts owing by the company to them were set off against the debt owing by them to the company for the allotment moneys". According to the taxpayer, the consideration was the setting off of the allocation moneys owed by Nominees and Mr Handbury against the debts owed by Magazines. In consequence, the "leaving time" for the purposes of Div 711 and s 104-520 coincided with the extinguishment of the liabilities to Nominees and Mr Handbury.

46 The taxpayer noted that step 4 in s 711-20 requires identification of "the liabilities that the leaving entity takes with it when it ceases to be a subsidiary member". The taxpayer submitted that, at the point when Magazines ceased to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group, it also ceased to be indebted to Nominees and Mr Handbury and, therefore, those debts were not "a liability of the leaving entity at the leaving time that can or must be identified in the entity's statement of financial position". In consequence, the taxpayer submitted that Magazines did not "take with it" any relevant liabilities on ceasing to be a subsidiary member, and that liabilities to Nominees and Mr Handbury extinguished at the leaving time were excluded from the sum deducted under step 4 from the allocable cost amount for the leaving entity, as calculated under s 711-20.

47 By excluding the extinguished debts from the step 4 deduction, the taxpayer argued that its net capital gain was reduced by $26,140,360.

74 Nominees and Mr Handbury did not become members of Magazines (that is, the holders of the shares in the company) until their names were entered in the share register of the company on 30 July 2004: see St Helens Farm 146 CLR at 427 per Aickin J; and Patcorp Investments 140 CLR at 293, 295-96 per Gibbs J and 303 per Jacobs J. See generally HAJ Ford, RP Austin and IM Ramsay, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (Butterworths, Australia, 2000), vol 2, at [17.170]. When their names were entered in the register, the shares came into existence as separate items of property: see Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at [20] ; St Helens Farm 146 CLR at 427 per Aickin J; also Commonwealth Homes and Investment 59 CLR at 461 per Dixon J. It follows that Nominees and Mr Handbury did not acquire any beneficial interest in shares in Magazines until 30 July 2004, at which point Magazines ceased to be a member of the consolidated group.</text>

<tocase>Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/249.html</AustLII>
<text>56 Under Pt 3 - 90 of the 1997 Act , the consolidated group is treated as a single taxpayer represented by the head company. The assets of a subsidiary member are treated as being held by the head company. As already noted, the head company inherits the tax history of the subsidiary member when it joins the group. Plainly enough, the regime established by Pt 3 - 90 is intended to reflect, within the tax framework, the commercial and economic realities of corporate group dealings: compare s 700-10. See generally Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249 at [6] - [9] per Mansfield J. As his Honour commented in Envestra at [6], "[t]hat process obviously required rules, including to set the cost for income tax purposes of the assets that a subsidiary member would bring into the group". Just as rules are needed for this purpose, so too rules are needed to govern the situation when a subsidiary member leaves the group. A subsidiary member leaves the group when it ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the head company.

57 As the earlier discussion shows, the drafting style used in Pt 3 - 90 is a distinctive one: it specifically directs attention to the objects of the scheme as a whole and in respect of aspects of the scheme, and to the particular principles that are instrumental in achieving these objects: see e.g., ss 700-10, 701 -15(2) &amp; (3), 705 -10(2) &amp; (3) and 711-5(2) &amp; (3). The more detailed provisions, or 'rules', that are to be applied to give effect to these principles are to be construed in light of these principles and objects.

58 This appeal is concerned with what happens when a subsidiary leaves the group. The object of Division 711, which governs this situation, is set out in s 711-5, namely, "to preserve the alignment of the head company's costs for membership interests ... established when entities become subsidiary members": s 711-5(2). The means by which this is to be achieved is "by recognising the head company's cost for those interests, just before the leaving time , as an amount equal to the cost of the leaving entity's assets at the leaving time reduced by the amount of its liabilities": s 711-5(3). The legislation is directed to quantifying the head company's cost for membership interests "just before the leaving time", to be done in the manner indicated. This is the principle that is intended to achieve the object of preserving the relevant alignment.</text>

<tocase>Tio v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 53 ; (2003) 126 FCR 185</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/53.html</AustLII>
<text>62 The broad subject matter is the tax treatment of consolidated groups and leaving members. Section 711-5(3) expressly states that the object in s 711-5(2) preserving the relevant alignment of head company's costs for membership interests is to be "achieved by recognising the head company's cost for those interests, just before the leaving time" as equalling "the cost of the leaving entity's assets at the leaving time" reduced by its liabilities. In this context, the phrases "just before the leaving time" and "at the leaving time" are intended to refer to essentially the same time. Whilst it might be thought that the use of different words was intended to refer to different points in time ("just before" as opposed to "at"), this interpretation would not, so it seems to me, make much sense in this context. It is to be borne in mind that the calculation under s 711- 45 (1) is for the purpose of determining the tax liability of the consolidated group be reference to the assets in the subsidiary company that is about to leave the group. Absent any contrary indication, it seems most reasonable to make this calculation done just before the company leaves the group. It therefore makes much better sense if the expression "at the leaving time" (a somewhat elastic phrase) is understood as synonymous with the phrase "just before the leaving time". The phrase "at the leaving time" has a different connotation from the phrase "at midnight", which was discussed by Stone J in Tio v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 53 ; (2003) 126 FCR 185 at [41] .

63 If the phrase "at the leaving time" is properly to be understood as meaning "just before the leaving time" in s 711-5(3), then, in the absence of any contrary indication, the same phrase is to be understood in the same way elsewhere in Div 711 and Pt 3 - 90 and, in particular, in s 711- 45 (1). I reject the taxpayer's submission that the phrase "just before the leaving time" and "at the leaving time" refer to different and distinct concepts.

64 There are a number of considerations that provide further support for this approach. First, as the analyses accompanying the Commissioner's written submissions showed, the taxpayer's construction would mean that the gain made on the sale of the shares was not brought to tax under Pt-3-90. That is, the taxpayer's construction would leave out of account under this regime the deduction of liabilities of about $25 million, which were said to be due to Mr Handbury and Nominees, although, as the taxpayer pointed out, part at least might be taxed on some other basis. The result would appear to be inconsistent with the principles on which Pt 3 - 90 is said to be based, especially s 711-5(3), and with its stated objects. It is worth emphasizing that the overarching object is to align the cost of the membership interests in a leaving entity with the cost of the net assets of the entity when the head company held all the membership interests in the leaving entity: see ss 701 -15(2) and 711-5(2). It is scarcely necessary to refer to s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) to affirm the principle that a construction that promotes the objects of the statutory regime in Pt 3 - 90 , as a whole and in specific aspects, is to be preferred to a construction that does not promote these objects. Whilst I accept that, in the taxation context, a consideration of this kind is not necessarily determinative, nonetheless it seems to me an important one. I reject the taxpayer's argument that I should not place much weight on this consideration.</text>

<tocase>Whim Creek Consolidated (NL) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 17 ALR 421</tocase>
<text>72 Payment for shares may, by agreement, be effected by a set off in discharge of a debt owing by the company to the intending member: see Whim Creek Consolidated (NL) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 17 ALR 421 at 429. This was what happened in this case. There was no execution of the contract in respect of the shares until the set-off was effected, which was on 30 July 2004. An entitlement to be registered did not arise before this date. There was therefore no "leaving time" before 30 July 2004.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/73.html</AustLII>
<text>73 There was some debate between the Commissioner and the taxpayer as to the significance of share allotment and issue. In the circumstances, it does not seem to me necessary to explore this issue in any detail. Speaking generally, there will be an allotment when there is a binding contract to issue and take shares and an appropriation of shares, usually by the directors, to the intending member: Commonwealth Homes and Investment Company Limited v Smith [1937] HCA 73 ; (1937) 59 CLR 443 at 461, Dixon J; Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll and Hurst [1949] HCA 19 ; (1949) 78 CLR 594 at 599 per Dixon J, quoting Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347 at 351 per Stirling J; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336 at 371 per Mason J. Plainly enough, an allottee acquires rights against the company, depending in part on the nature of the contract between the intending member and the company. These rights do not, however, turn the allottee into a member holding the shares. This will happen only when the shares "issue", that is, when the shareholder is "put in control of the shares allotted": see Central Piggery 78 CLR at 599-600 per Dixon J.

74 Nominees and Mr Handbury did not become members of Magazines (that is, the holders of the shares in the company) until their names were entered in the share register of the company on 30 July 2004: see St Helens Farm 146 CLR at 427 per Aickin J; and Patcorp Investments 140 CLR at 293, 295-96 per Gibbs J and 303 per Jacobs J.
