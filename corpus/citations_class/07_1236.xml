<tocase>Alexander v Home Office [1988] 2 All ER 118</tocase>
<text>16 In this case, the submission of the applicant is that the damage caused to the applicant was in the form of hurt feelings, humiliation and embarrassment suffered as a result of the unlawful discriminatory behaviour on the part of the respondent. Both Mr O'Gorman SC and Mr Murdoch have referred me in this respect to comments of May LJ in Alexander v Home Office [1988] 2 All ER 118 at 122. Although the comments of his Lordship in that case were referable to a claim for racial discrimination, nonetheless they are in my view of assistance in the case before me:
 
 "As with any other awards of damages, the objective of an award for unlawful racial discrimination is restitution. Where the discrimination has caused actual pecuniary loss such as the refusal of a job, then the damages referable to this can be readily calculated. For the injury to feelings, however, for the humiliation, for the insult, it is impossible to say what is restitution and the answer must depend on the experience and good sense of the judge and his assessors. Awards should not be minimal, because this would tend to trivialise or diminish respect for the public policy to which the [Act] gives effect. On the other hand, just because it is impossible to assess the monetary value of injured feelings, awards should be restrained. To award sums which are generally felt to be excessive does almost as much harm to the policy and the results which it seeks to achieve as do nominal awards. Further injury to feelings, which is likely to be of a relatively short duration, is less serious than physical injury to the body or the mind which may persist for months, and in many cases for life."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/197.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Clearly each case turns on its own facts, and Counsel acknowledged that damages awarded in other cases are of limited use only. Indeed, a review of cases where damages have been awarded in respect of discriminatory conduct reveal a considerable variance in the sums awarded. Relevant cases include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; in Clarke 202 ALR 340 a deaf child who had been refused enrolment at a religious school thereby removing him from his primary school peers and friends at the time of his transition to high school was awarded damages of $20,000 plus interest. Madgwick J was of the view that the child would have been distressed and confused by the events, and viewed the respondent's conduct as hurtful, but that the harm to the child was likely to have been transient and not extreme. The sum of $20,000 was described by Sackville and Stone JJ on appeal as "relatively modest": Catholic Education Office v Clarke [2004] FCAFC 197 ; (2004) 138 FCR 121 at 149
 &#8226; in Commonwealth of Australia v Evans [2004] FCA 654 an intelligence analyst who was transferred to a position with lesser responsibilities because she was perceived as showing insufficient commitment to her work because she took time off to care for her sick child was awarded damages of $12,000
 &#8226; in Leslie v Graham [2002] FCA 32 where the applicant was subject to extreme sexual advances by her employer in the middle of the night and subsequently suffered emotional trauma, the court awarded her $16,000
 &#8226; in Sheehan [2002] FMCA 95 , a member of a club who was prevented from entering the club with an assistance dog not on a lead was awarded $1,500 damages
 &#8226; in Grovenor [2000] FCA 1574 a woman with a guide dog who was the subject of verbal abuse by the owner of a furniture store, and who subsequently suffered a skin rash related to her distress, was awarded $1,000 damages
 &#8226; in Haar v Maldon Nominees (2000) 184 ALR 83 a woman with a guide dog who sat in the "party area" of McDonalds, and was told by a member of the staff that it would be better if she sat elsewhere in the restaurant because of the presence of her dog, was awarded $3,000 damages in circumstances where the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the incident had caused the applicant to have diminished self-worth which continued three years after the incident.</text>

<tocase>Clarke v Catholic Education Offic e (2003) 202 ALR 340</tocase>
<text>9 The submissions of the applicant in relation to these outstanding issues may be summarised as follows:
 
 
 1. The courts have ordered apologies to be made in appropriate circumstances.
 2. Damages should be compensatory and not punitive. Damages in this case should be decided in a manner akin to general principles laid down in Haines v Bendall [1991] HCA 15 ; (1991) 172 CLR 60 and Hall v Sheiban Pty Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 217.
 3. In particular, the Court may order a respondent to pay damages by way of compensation for hurt feelings, humiliation and embarrassment suffered by the applicant as a result of unlawful discriminatory behaviour on the part of the respondent. In assessing the damages payable, in this case it is of relevance that: 
 

a. the applicant has a psychiatric disability
 
b. the applicant was unable to access the respondent's health services on a number of occasions, something that would obviously cause distress to a person with the applicant's medical condition and needs
 
c. the discrimination on the part of the respondent resulted in the applicant being unable to utilise the assistance of his dogs when he wished to access the respondent's services, even though the dogs assisted the applicant to alleviate the effects of his disability
 
d. there was wilful disregard of the applicant's rights by the respondent
 
e. the respondent is a State government, and therefore should exhibit exemplary behaviour
 
f. the applicant had little option but to accept the behaviour/treatment dealt out to him by the respondent
 
g. the hurt suffered by the applicant continues almost three years after the events in question.
 
 
 4. Although each case turns on its own facts, a case such as Clarke v Catholic Education Offic e (2003) 202 ALR 340 is of some guidance.

15 There is no dispute that damages which can be awarded in these circumstances are compensatory, not punitive: Hall v Sheiban 20 FCR 217 at 282, Clarke 202 ALR 340 at 360. As Lockhart J pointed out in Hall v Sheiban at 239 damages awarded should be based on a comparison of the position that the applicant would have been in if he had not been subjected to the discriminatory acts of the respondent, with the position he is in as a result of those acts.

17 Clearly each case turns on its own facts, and Counsel acknowledged that damages awarded in other cases are of limited use only. Indeed, a review of cases where damages have been awarded in respect of discriminatory conduct reveal a considerable variance in the sums awarded. Relevant cases include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; in Clarke 202 ALR 340 a deaf child who had been refused enrolment at a religious school thereby removing him from his primary school peers and friends at the time of his transition to high school was awarded damages of $20,000 plus interest.

 &#8226; in Commonwealth of Australia v Evans [2004] FCA 654 an intelligence analyst who was transferred to a position with lesser responsibilities because she was perceived as showing insufficient commitment to her work because she took time off to care for her sick child was awarded damages of $12,000
 &#8226; in Leslie v Graham [2002] FCA 32 where the applicant was subject to extreme sexual advances by her employer in the middle of the night and subsequently suffered emotional trauma, the court awarded her $16,000
 &#8226; in Sheehan [2002] FMCA 95 , a member of a club who was prevented from entering the club with an assistance dog not on a lead was awarded $1,500 damages
 &#8226; in Grovenor [2000] FCA 1574 a woman with a guide dog who was the subject of verbal abuse by the owner of a furniture store, and who subsequently suffered a skin rash related to her distress, was awarded $1,000 damages
 &#8226; in Haar v Maldon Nominees (2000) 184 ALR 83 a woman with a guide dog who sat in the "party area" of McDonalds, and was told by a member of the staff that it would be better if she sat elsewhere in the restaurant because of the presence of her dog, was awarded $3,000 damages in circumstances where the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the incident had caused the applicant to have diminished self-worth which continued three years after the incident.

21 In my view the effects of this incident on the applicant cannot be compared with, for example, serious interruption to education ( Clarke 202 ALR 340) or emotional trauma and career impact as a result of sexual harassment ( Leslie [2002] FCA 32). However, in my view the public humiliation and embarrassment occasioned to the applicant was clearly more patent than in either Grovenor [2000] FCA 95 or Haar 184 ALR 83. I consider the sum of $5,000 appropriate compensation, and order that interest at the annual rate of 5% be payable on this sum pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to be calculated from 16 November 2004 when the cause of action arose.</text>

<tocase>De Simone v Bevacqua (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, McDonald J, 15 September 1994)</tocase>
<text>13 While courts in human rights cases have sometimes ordered that apologies be made (for example, De Simone v Bevacqua (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, McDonald J, 15 September 1994), Zheng v Beamish [2004] FMCA 61 , Oberoi v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2001] FMCA 34) , like many other judges before me, I consider that a court-ordered apology serves little purpose: Jones on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry v The Bible Believers' Church [2007] FCA 55 at [65] , Rawcliffe v Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service [2007] FMCA 931 at [101] , Jones v Toben [2002] FCA 1150 at [106] , Jones v Scully [2001] FCA 879 ; (2001) 113 FCR 343.</text>

<tocase>Grovenor v Eldridge [2000] FCA 1574</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1574.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The submissions of the respondent in relation to these outstanding issues may be summarised as follows:
 
 
 1. It is pointless forcing an apology, hence no order should be made in this respect.
 2. With respect to an order for damages, the following issues are relevant: 
 

a. on 16 November 2004 the applicant was not seeking to access "health services", but rather was seeking to collect a document he had previously requested
 
b. on only one of the five occasions that are the subject of the complaint concerning Smithfield Community Health Centre did the applicant leave the Centre without receiving dental treatment. Accordingly, it is not the case that he was unable to access health services or was denied such access
 
c. the real issue for the applicant was that he was denied something he perceived to be his right
 
d. there is no basis to submit that there was a wilful disregard of the applicant's rights by the respondent
 
e. there is no evidence that the applicant continues to feel hurt
 
f. it does not follow that the respondent did not act in an exemplary fashion.
 
 
 3. The authorities relied on by the applicant do not support the award of an amount as high as $40,000, and the majority of the cases relied upon by the applicant can be distinguished because, for example, in this case there is no suggestion of any personal injury, nor was the respondent's conduct malicious. Relevant comparators are Sheehan v Tin Can Bay Country Club [2002] FMCA 95 , Grovenor v Eldridge [2000] FCA 1574 and McNamara v Golonaise Pty Ltd [2006] QADT 7. 
 4. The evidence does not support a finding that the applicant was "publicly humiliated", particularly in relation to events at Smithfield Community Health Centre.
 5. Given the bona fides of the respondent, the comparatively minimal impact upon the applicant and the number and nature of the events that comprise the complaints, general damages should be in the amount of $5,000 in total.

17 Clearly each case turns on its own facts, and Counsel acknowledged that damages awarded in other cases are of limited use only. Indeed, a review of cases where damages have been awarded in respect of discriminatory conduct reveal a considerable variance in the sums awarded. Relevant cases include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; in Clarke 202 ALR 340 a deaf child who had been refused enrolment at a religious school thereby removing him from his primary school peers and friends at the time of his transition to high school was awarded damages of $20,000 plus interest. Madgwick J was of the view that the child would have been distressed and confused by the events, and viewed the respondent's conduct as hurtful, but that the harm to the child was likely to have been transient and not extreme. The sum of $20,000 was described by Sackville and Stone JJ on appeal as "relatively modest": Catholic Education Office v Clarke [2004] FCAFC 197 ; (2004) 138 FCR 121 at 149
 &#8226; in Commonwealth of Australia v Evans [2004] FCA 654 an intelligence analyst who was transferred to a position with lesser responsibilities because she was perceived as showing insufficient commitment to her work because she took time off to care for her sick child was awarded damages of $12,000
 &#8226; in Leslie v Graham [2002] FCA 32 where the applicant was subject to extreme sexual advances by her employer in the middle of the night and subsequently suffered emotional trauma, the court awarded her $16,000
 &#8226; in Sheehan [2002] FMCA 95 , a member of a club who was prevented from entering the club with an assistance dog not on a lead was awarded $1,500 damages
 &#8226; in Grovenor [2000] FCA 1574 a woman with a guide dog who was the subject of verbal abuse by the owner of a furniture store, and who subsequently suffered a skin rash related to her distress, was awarded $1,000 damages
 &#8226; in Haar v Maldon Nominees (2000) 184 ALR 83 a woman with a guide dog who sat in the "party area" of McDonalds, and was told by a member of the staff that it would be better if she sat elsewhere in the restaurant because of the presence of her dog, was awarded $3,000 damages in circumstances where the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the incident had caused the applicant to have diminished self-worth which continued three years after the incident.

21 In my view the effects of this incident on the applicant cannot be compared with, for example, serious interruption to education ( Clarke 202 ALR 340) or emotional trauma and career impact as a result of sexual harassment ( Leslie [2002] FCA 32). However, in my view the public humiliation and embarrassment occasioned to the applicant was clearly more patent than in either Grovenor [2000] FCA 95 or Haar 184 ALR 83. I consider the sum of $5,000 appropriate compensation, and order that interest at the annual rate of 5% be payable on this sum pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to be calculated from 16 November 2004 when the cause of action arose.

25 In my view the damage to the applicant as a result of the five incidents at Smithfield Community Health Centre is at the lower end of the scale, comparable to the circumstances in Grovenor [2000] FCA 95 and Haar 184 ALR 83. I consider that the sum of $3,000 is proper compensation in these circumstances. Further, in light of the proximity in time of the occurrence of the five incidents the subject of complaint, I order that interest at the annual rate of 5% be payable on this sum pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to be calculated from 19 November 2004 when the cause of action first arose in these proceedings.
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 

 
 In respect of QUD324/2005: 
 
 1. The respondent is to pay the applicant damages in the sum of $5,000.
 2. The respondent is to pay interest on damages of $5,000 at an annual rate of 5% to be calculated from 16 November 2004 pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 

 In respect of QUD522/2005: 
 
 1. The respondent is to pay the applicant damages in the sum of $3,000.
 2. The respondent is to pay interest on damages of $3,000 at an annual rate of 5% to be calculated from 19 November 2004 pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 

 In respect of QUD324/2005, QUD522/2005 and QUD211/2006 
 
 1. The respondent is to pay the applicant's costs in QUD324 of 2005 and QUD522 of 2005 other than the applicant's costs associated with the Notice of Motion to exclude the evidence of Dr Unwin, to be taxed if not agreed.
 2. The applicant is to pay the respondent's costs of the Notice of Motion to exclude the evidence of Dr Unwin, to be taxed if not agreed.
 3. The applicant is to pay the respondent's costs that relate solely to the respondent's costs in QUD211 of 2006, to be taxed if not agreed.

In assessing the damages payable, in this case it is of relevance that: 
 

a. the applicant has a psychiatric disability
 
b. the applicant was unable to access the respondent's health services on a number of occasions, something that would obviously cause distress to a person with the applicant's medical condition and needs
 
c. the discrimination on the part of the respondent resulted in the applicant being unable to utilise the assistance of his dogs when he wished to access the respondent's services, even though the dogs assisted the applicant to alleviate the effects of his disability
 
d. there was wilful disregard of the applicant's rights by the respondent
 
e. the respondent is a State government, and therefore should exhibit exemplary behaviour
 
f. the applicant had little option but to accept the behaviour/treatment dealt out to him by the respondent
 
g. the hurt suffered by the applicant continues almost three years after the events in question.
 
 
 4. Although each case turns on its own facts, a case such as Clarke v Catholic Education Offic e (2003) 202 ALR 340 is of some guidance.

15 There is no dispute that damages which can be awarded in these circumstances are compensatory, not punitive: Hall v Sheiban 20 FCR 217 at 282, Clarke 202 ALR 340 at 360. As Lockhart J pointed out in Hall v Sheiban at 239 damages awarded should be based on a comparison of the position that the applicant would have been in if he had not been subjected to the discriminatory acts of the respondent, with the position he is in as a result of those acts.</text>

<text>13 While courts in human rights cases have sometimes ordered that apologies be made (for example, De Simone v Bevacqua (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, McDonald J, 15 September 1994), Zheng v Beamish [2004] FMCA 61 , Oberoi v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2001] FMCA 34) , like many other judges before me, I consider that a court-ordered apology serves little purpose: Jones on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry v The Bible Believers' Church [2007] FCA 55 at [65] , Rawcliffe v Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service [2007] FMCA 931 at [101] , Jones v Toben [2002] FCA 1150 at [106] , Jones v Scully [2001] FCA 879 ; (2001) 113 FCR 343.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/32.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Clearly each case turns on its own facts, and Counsel acknowledged that damages awarded in other cases are of limited use only. Indeed, a review of cases where damages have been awarded in respect of discriminatory conduct reveal a considerable variance in the sums awarded. Relevant cases include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; in Clarke 202 ALR 340 a deaf child who had been refused enrolment at a religious school thereby removing him from his primary school peers and friends at the time of his transition to high school was awarded damages of $20,000 plus interest. Madgwick J was of the view that the child would have been distressed and confused by the events, and viewed the respondent's conduct as hurtful, but that the harm to the child was likely to have been transient and not extreme. The sum of $20,000 was described by Sackville and Stone JJ on appeal as "relatively modest": Catholic Education Office v Clarke [2004] FCAFC 197 ; (2004) 138 FCR 121 at 149
 &#8226; in Commonwealth of Australia v Evans [2004] FCA 654 an intelligence analyst who was transferred to a position with lesser responsibilities because she was perceived as showing insufficient commitment to her work because she took time off to care for her sick child was awarded damages of $12,000
 &#8226; in Leslie v Graham [2002] FCA 32 where the applicant was subject to extreme sexual advances by her employer in the middle of the night and subsequently suffered emotional trauma, the court awarded her $16,000
 &#8226; in Sheehan [2002] FMCA 95 , a member of a club who was prevented from entering the club with an assistance dog not on a lead was awarded $1,500 damages
 &#8226; in Grovenor [2000] FCA 1574 a woman with a guide dog who was the subject of verbal abuse by the owner of a furniture store, and who subsequently suffered a skin rash related to her distress, was awarded $1,000 damages
 &#8226; in Haar v Maldon Nominees (2000) 184 ALR 83 a woman with a guide dog who sat in the "party area" of McDonalds, and was told by a member of the staff that it would be better if she sat elsewhere in the restaurant because of the presence of her dog, was awarded $3,000 damages in circumstances where the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the incident had caused the applicant to have diminished self-worth which continued three years after the incident.

21 In my view the effects of this incident on the applicant cannot be compared with, for example, serious interruption to education ( Clarke 202 ALR 340) or emotional trauma and career impact as a result of sexual harassment ( Leslie [2002] FCA 32). However, in my view the public humiliation and embarrassment occasioned to the applicant was clearly more patent than in either Grovenor [2000] FCA 95 or Haar 184 ALR 83. I consider the sum of $5,000 appropriate compensation, and order that interest at the annual rate of 5% be payable on this sum pursuant to s 51A(1)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to be calculated from 16 November 2004 when the cause of action arose.</text>

<text>10 The submissions of the respondent in relation to these outstanding issues may be summarised as follows:
 
 
 1. It is pointless forcing an apology, hence no order should be made in this respect.
 2. With respect to an order for damages, the following issues are relevant: 
 

a. on 16 November 2004 the applicant was not seeking to access "health services", but rather was seeking to collect a document he had previously requested
 
b. on only one of the five occasions that are the subject of the complaint concerning Smithfield Community Health Centre did the applicant leave the Centre without receiving dental treatment. Accordingly, it is not the case that he was unable to access health services or was denied such access
 
c. the real issue for the applicant was that he was denied something he perceived to be his right
 
d. there is no basis to submit that there was a wilful disregard of the applicant's rights by the respondent
 
e. there is no evidence that the applicant continues to feel hurt
 
f. it does not follow that the respondent did not act in an exemplary fashion.
 
 
 3. The authorities relied on by the applicant do not support the award of an amount as high as $40,000, and the majority of the cases relied upon by the applicant can be distinguished because, for example, in this case there is no suggestion of any personal injury, nor was the respondent's conduct malicious. Relevant comparators are Sheehan v Tin Can Bay Country Club [2002] FMCA 95 , Grovenor v Eldridge [2000] FCA 1574 and McNamara v Golonaise Pty Ltd [2006] QADT 7. 
 4. The evidence does not support a finding that the applicant was "publicly humiliated", particularly in relation to events at Smithfield Community Health Centre.
 5. Given the bona fides of the respondent, the comparatively minimal impact upon the applicant and the number and nature of the events that comprise the complaints, general damages should be in the amount of $5,000 in total.</text>
