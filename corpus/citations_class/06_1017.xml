<tocase>Spencer v The Commonwealth (1907) 5 CLR 418</tocase>
<text>To arrive at the value of property on a particular date, it is necessary to make a judgment as to the price at which the property would be sold on that date by voluntary bargaining between a seller and a buyer willing to trade, but neither of whom is so anxious to do so that the buyer or seller would overlook any ordinary business consideration. The judgment must be made on the assumption that both buyer and seller are perfectly acquainted with the property and cognisant of all circumstances that might affect its value, either advantageously or prejudicially. Having placed itself in the position of such parties at the relevant date, the question for the decision maker to determine is the point at which the buyer and seller would meet: that is to say, the aim is to determine the sum that the buyer would be willing to pay and the price that the seller would be prepared to take (see Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 70 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 441). So much is undoubted.</text>

<tocase>Teh v Ramsay Centauri Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 456</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2002/456-.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the first question that arises in the present context is to determine just what is to be valued. Section 667C refers to ' the company as a whole '. That phrase signifies the overall enterprise or undertaking of the relevant company, in the sense of the whole of its assets and its liabilities as a going concern or as a cohesive collection of resources organised so as to produce a return through outlay. Attention is directed at the sum of the component parts, viewed as a productive organisational whole and not at any particular asset or advantage (see Teh v Ramsay Centauri Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 456 at [13] ).

In particular, the phrase does not direct attention to the value of particular share capital of the relevant company. On the other hand, dealings in the share capital of a company may give considerable assistance in the task of determining the value of that company as a whole.

The date as at which the value is to be determined is the date at which the 90% holder gives the relevant compulsory acquisition notice. It is at that point that the 90% holder initiates the process for compulsory acquisition. The holders of the shares that are to be subject to acquisition are drawn into a relationship with the 90% holder, whether they like it or not, by the operation of the Act (see Teh v Ramsay Centauri at [28]).

The E&amp;Y Report did not directly address the question of the value of the Company as a whole, in the terms just outlined. The E&amp;Y Report referred expressly to the provisions of s 667C(1) and referred to Practice Note 43, issued by the Commission, which provides guidance on possible valuation methodologies for an expert to consider. However, notwithstanding the express reference to s 667C(1), the E&amp;Y Report adopted the approach of valuing the ordinary shares and the preference shares in the Company and then aggregating those values to arrive at the value of the Company as a whole. While, ultimately, the result of such an exercise may be helpful, that does not appear to me to be the approach called for by the terms of s 667C.

The Company operates in the newspaper printing and publishing industry in Australia. The E&amp;Y Report began with an overview of that industry followed by a profile of the Company. The core operating activity of the Company is publishing ' The Advocate ', a regional daily newspaper based in Burnie, Tasmania. The Company also operates a printing business which prints The Advocate as well as undertaking general printing for third parties. The Company also has a 40 per cent interest in The Examiner Newspaper Pty Ltd, which publishes ' The Examiner ', a newspaper based in Launceston, Tasmania.</text>

<tocase>Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2005/211-.html</AustLII>
<text>I do not consider that an addition for the special value identified in the E&amp;Y Report is appropriate, having regard to the language of s 667C. As I have said, the first step requires the determination of the value, as at the date of the compulsory acquisition notice, of the Company as a whole, in the sense indicated above. It is impermissible, in determining fair value, to make any allowance for synergies to be achieved by the acquisition. It is equally impermissible in determining fair value to take into account special benefits deriving from full ownership (see Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211 at [35] ).

I have taken some trouble to deal with Ernst &amp; Young's opinion in some detail since, for the reasons I have indicated, I consider that it adopts an inappropriate approach. However, neither defendant suggested that such an inappropriate approach invalidated the process. That is to say, they accepted that it is a matter for the Court, on the basis of the evidence before it, which was limited to the Expert's Report, to determine whether Regional has established that $2.50 per preference share gives shareholders a fair value for the preference shares.

The defendants advanced arguments concerning the basis upon which the so-called special value should be allocated between ordinary shares and preference shares. The contention appears to be that Regional is a buyer of preference shares, and the present holders, apart from Regional, are sellers of preference shares. They suggested that it is necessary to allocate the special value of $1.4 million identified by Ernst &amp; Young between Regional, on the one hand, and preference share holders, who include Regional, on the other hand. Something in the order of half and half was suggested as appropriate. The contention appears to be that that exercise should be undertaken as part of the allocation of the value of the Company as a whole between the two classes of shares.</text>
