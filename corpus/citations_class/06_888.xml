<tocase>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223</tocase>
<text>12 The Amended Notice of Appeal claimed that seven questions of law were raised in the appeal. The errors of law underlying these questions are said to be that the Tribunal: 
 
 (a) applied the wrong test of 'serious hardship'; (b) made errors in dealing with the materials and evidence before it in that: (i) it made findings for which there was no evidence; (ii) it failed to take relevant considerations into account and took irrelevant considerations into account; (iii) its conclusions were affected by Wednesbury unreasonableness; and (iv) it wrongly applied the test of 'serious hardship' by finding that the respondent would suffer 'serious hardship' within the meaning of s 340- 5 (3) if he was not released from part of his tax debt, when that finding was not open to it on the evidence; 
 
 (c) it failed to exercise its discretion as to relief given in s 340- 5 (3) of the Act.

51 The alleged errors set out in (b)(iii) and (iv) in paragraph [12] of these reasons essentially raise the same issues and can be dealt with together. The applicant says that a finding of serious hardship was not open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it and that the decision was totally unreasonable in the sense referred to by Lord Greene MR in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 229-230. The principle on which the applicant relies was elaborated by Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41-42 where his Honour said:
 
 'It follows that, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power ... I say "generally" because both principle and authority indicate that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance. The preferred ground on which this is done, however, is not the failure to take into account relevant considerations or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations, but that the decision is "manifestly unreasonable". ... However, in its application, there has been considerable diversity in the readiness with which courts have found the test to be satisfied. ... But guidance may be found in the close analogy between judicial review of administrative action and appellate review of a judicial discretion. In the context of the latter, it has been held that an appellate court may review a discretionary judgment that has failed to give proper weight to a particular matter, but it will be slow to do so because a mere preference for a different result will not suffice. ... So too in the context of administrative law, a court should proceed with caution when reviewing an administrative decision on the ground that it does not give proper weight to relevant factors, lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on the merits.'

57 The Tribunal's decision to grant relief to a taxpayer who is in receipt of what, by community standards, is a very substantial income is initially surprising. However, the decision was based on a consideration of the evidence and the respondent's particular circumstances. As the Tribunal saw it, that income was highly vulnerable should the respondent be made bankrupt and, given the complications arising from the wife's illness, it was very likely that serious hardship would follow. On balance, I find that the Tribunal's conclusion was open to it and that the applicant has failed to establish the high standards of unreasonableness required for a decision to be reviewable on the Wednesbury ground. Whilst other minds might reasonably have disagreed with the Tribunal's inferences of fact and ultimate conclusion, the Tribunal's decision was not so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could ever have come to it; see Zizza v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 371 at [15].</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>27 The distinction between issues of fact and law was comprehensively addressed by Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 ( Bond ) where his Honour said at 355-6: 
 
 'The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law ... Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law ... This is because, before the inference is drawn, there is the preliminary question whether the evidence reasonably admits of different conclusions ... So, in the context of judicial review, it has been accepted that the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law...' 
 (citations omitted.)

28 His Honour observed, however, that the authorities indicate that it is not an error of law to make a wrong finding of fact and at 356 expressed the following view, with which Brennan J (at 365) and Toohey &amp; Gaudron JJ, (at 387) generally agreed:
 
 'Thus, at common law, according to the Australian authorities, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as there is some basis for an inference in other words, the particular inference is reasonably open even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.' 
 (emphasis added.)

29 Having referred to a line of English cases that support a 'no sufficient evidence' test in the context of judicial review of findings of fact and a further line of cases that suggested that inferences of fact were reviewable where they could not be reasonably drawn from the primary facts, his Honour added at 359-60:
 
 'a finding of fact will then be reviewable on the ground that there is no probative evidence to support it and an inference will be reviewable on the ground that it was not reasonably open on the facts, which amounts to the same thing .'

<tocase>Corlette v Mackenzie (1996) 62 FCR 597</tocase>
<text>58 The Tribunal's conclusion as to 'serious hardship' does not conclude the matter. The decision to release the respondent from his tax obligations is clearly discretionary. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal either failed to exercise this discretion, or failed to exercise this discretion properly. The existence of the Tribunal's discretion is not in doubt. As Wilcox J observed in Corlette v Mackenzie (1996) 62 FCR 597 at 598:
 
 'It would be extremely odd if a taxpayer who was the author of his or her misfortunes, through imprudent or extravagant expenditure, was entitled, as a matter of right, to a release of unpaid tax.'</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>24 To isolate each element of this complex factual analysis and subject it, out of context, to a detailed examination of the evidence to see if there is support for that element distorts the review process. The cautions of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 against over-zealous scrutiny 'by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed' are peculiarly appropriate here; at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

25 In the same case Kirby J said, at 291:
 
 'The reasons under challenge must be read as a whole. They must be considered fairly. It is erroneous to adopt a narrow approach, combing through the words of the decision-maker with a fine appellate tooth-comb, against the prospect that a verbal slip will be found warranting the inference of an error of law.' 

His Honour recognised, however, that a decision-maker must establish the facts on the basis of evidence but warned, at 293, against 'an over-nice approach to the standard of proof'. Such an approach, 'betrays a misunderstanding of the way administrative decisions are usually made'.

26 In this case the Tribunal, either expressly or impliedly, took into account all the factors mentioned in [23] above. On the basis of evidence about those factors it made inferences of fact about the likelihood of certain events occurring in the future. In my view the Tribunal's conclusions were open to it on the evidence. However even if one regarded the minute analysis suggested by the applicant as necessary, for the reasons given below, I am still of the view that the applicant has not demonstrated that the Tribunal made a legal error.</text>

<tocase>Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252</tocase>
<text>13 The term 'serious hardship' is not defined in the Act. In Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252 (' Evreniades ') Hill J considered the term as used in s 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). His Honour, who was concerned with serious hardship to a taxpayer's dependants upon the death of the taxpayer, observed, at 258:
 
 'There is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by 'serious hardship' nor would one expect there to be. Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning. The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious. The financial difficulty will be such that the dependants will be in significant need warranting action by the Relief Board to relieve their condition.'

14 Hill J accepted that there was a distinction between extreme and serious hardship noting that what will constitute either will depend on the circumstances. His Honour also said it was inappropriate to attempt to state tests of what would constitute 'serious hardship' in the abstract and commented, at 259:
 
 'Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support. That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship.' 

These observations were referred to with apparent approval by Gummow J in Van Grieken v Veilands (1991) 21 ATR 1639 at 1644.

16 In the Amended Notice of Appeal the applicant complains that the Tribunal used the 'wrong test' in determining the prospect of 'serious hardship' for the respondent. In its written submissions it expressed its complaint somewhat differently saying that the Tribunal 'misunderstood the meaning' of the term. It seems to me that the latter expression is less likely to lead to confusion as it recognises, at least implicitly, that "serious hardship" is itself the test that has to be applied to an applicant's circumstances to decide if that applicant is eligible for relief from a tax debt. There is no other test, although there may be issues about which factors, in the particular circumstances, are or are not relevant to this determination. It is because the assessment is based so squarely on the individual circumstances that Hill J in Evreniades thought it was inappropriate to try and identify, in the abstract, the circumstances that would give rise to serious hardship.

17 This is not to say that guidance cannot be given by examples in which the test of serious hardship would clearly be met. In Evreniades, Hill J gave such an example when he recognised that there would be 'severe financial hardship' if persons were left 'destitute without any means of support'. The Taxation Ruling gives a similar example when it says that there would be serious hardship if a taxpayer were left 'without the means to achieve reasonable acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements'. I do not see any inconsistency in these examples. Effect must be given to the qualification of 'reasonable' in the Taxation Ruling and, consistently with the reasoning of Hill J, these examples do not exclude the possibility that something less than destitution will constitute serious hardship. Whether this is so depends on the particular circumstances of each case.

18 It is not entirely clear that the Tribunal appreciated that the Taxation Ruling allowed for consideration of individual circumstances. In commenting on the Ruling the Tribunal said that 'it is no more than policy and cannot bind this Tribunal'. This comment seems to suggest that the Tribunal misunderstood the Ruling as providing a rigid rule. As I have already explained, I do not think that this is the correct interpretation of the Ruling but, as the Tribunal did not apply any such rigid rule, the misunderstanding is not of present concern.

19 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal's rejection of the Taxation Ruling indicates that it used some other unidentified test of serious hardship to make its decision. I do not accept this submission. The Tribunal noted that what is needed for proper maintenance and support is a relative question that can only be answered with regard to the whole of the taxpayer's circumstances. The Tribunal considered all the relevant aspects of the respondent's circumstances including whether he could achieve 'acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements' that were not excessive or unreasonable in all the circumstances. I do not accept that the Tribunal used the wrong test.

59 The Tribunal was aware that it had discretion to grant or withhold relief even it was satisfied on the serious hardship point. This is made clear by the Tribunal's quoting from the decision of Hill J in Evreniades, where his Honour said at 262-263: 
 
 'It follows from Trebilco that in the course of consideration of the release of tax under s 265 the Board may consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship but also other matters which in the discretion of the Board may be relevant, those other matters being merely proscribed by the general principle that the discretion must be exercised bona fide and for the purposes for which it was conferred, there being jurisdiction in this Court to intervene if in the overall exercise of the discretion the Board does take into account considerations which having regard to the purposes served by s 265 , can be seen to be irrelevant,'

60 I am satisfied that the Tribunal did exercise its discretion. Although the issue of discretion is not addressed under a separate heading there is sufficient indication of this throughout the Tribunal's reasons for me to be satisfied that this is so.

61 It was accepted on all sides that the respondent's debt had not arisen because of avoidance or participation in any scheme. The applicant submitted, however, that the Tribunal failed to take into account that the respondent had earned substantial amounts of money in the relevant period without making adequate provision for his tax liability. The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal shows that the Tribunal questioned the respondent about the issue. The respondent talked at length about the difficulties he had in the law firm where the income that gave rise to the tax debt was generated. He said that the firm had the capacity to reduce his income retrospectively so that amounts that he was anticipating he would receive did not materialise. He also referred to difficulties he had experienced on a family level in moving from interstate at a time when his wife's illness, with consequent medical expenses, first manifested itself. At the same time one child's learning difficulty and another's serious heart condition (now resolved) were diagnosed. The combination of these factors led to his neglecting his financial affairs and not realising that a debt was accumulated. His subsequent drop in income made it impossible to meet the debt.</text>

<tocase>Powley v Crimes Compensation Tribunal (1996) 11 VAR 146</tocase>
<text>31 In Schmid v Comcare (2003) 77 ALD 782 at 786, Weinberg J emphasised the 'high threshold' that needed to be met before a Court would find an error of law on the 'no evidence' ground. This high threshold was also referred to in Powley v Crimes Compensation Tribunal (1996) 11 VAR 146 where Phillips JA said at 157:
 
 'The word 'reasonably' is used in this context, I suggest, just to emphasise that, when judging what was open and what was not open below, we are speaking of rational tribunals acting according to law, not irrational ones acting arbitrarily. The danger of using the word 'reasonably' lies in its being taken to suggest that a finding of fact may be overturned, on an appeal which is limited to the question of law, simply because that finding is regarded as 'unreasonable'. That is not the law as I understand it, at least in Australia. A finding of fact will be overturned on an appeal on a question of law only if that finding was not open.'

 'a finding of fact will only be open to challenge as erroneous in law if there is no probative evidence to support it (and not also if it is not reasonably open on the evidence), whilst an inference will be open to challenge as being erroneous in law if it was not reasonably open on the facts. But, as the statement of Mason, C.J. at 360 shows, there is virtually no difference between the tests.'</text>
