<text>6 Upon the return of the motion on 30 January 2007 I ordered security for costs and dismissed the motion so far as it sought transfer of the proceedings: Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 49 . I reserved judgment on the strike out motion until today.

7 For the reasons that follow, in my opinion, the statement of claim should be struck out and a substituted statement of claim filed. I propose also to give the respondents the opportunity to provide basic information about their respective roles in what I refer to as the "Hog's Breath" group and the ways in which the so-called Hog's Breath Works and/or the registered trade marks have been applied. I will not direct that they do so. In the event that they decline to do so and the applicant files a substituted statement of claim, adequately pleaded having regard to the information it has available to it, then I will entertain applications for specific discovery and/or leave to interrogate so that the statement of claim may be further reviewed prior to the filing of a defence.

8 The applicant is a citizen of the United States of America. He says that he is and was at all material times a prominent and well-known artist in the United States and is, and was at all material times "the owner of copyright in the 'Wave Hog Work'". A copy of the work is depicted in Schedule A to the application filed in these proceedings.</text>
