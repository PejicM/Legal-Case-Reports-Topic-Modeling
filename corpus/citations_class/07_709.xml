<text>18 Hotchkin Hanley did not respond to ASIC's letter of 8 March 2007. Ferrier Hodgson responded but did not pursue its previous concerns. Mr Carey and Ms Carey, through their solicitors Mony de Kerloy, wrote to ASIC on 9 March 2007 asserting that the Westpoint documents might contain legally privileged information and that to obtain appropriate advice their clients required funding from moneys held by Healthcare Properties Pty Ltd (Healthcare). ASIC rejected this contention on 13 March 2007. An application for release of funds from Healthcare was refused in my judgment on 17 April 2007: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Ltd v Carey (No 15) [2007] FCA 544.

19 ASIC's release does not extend to copies of what is known as the Redchime server. This is on the basis that the materials obtained from that server were not produced to ASIC by KordaMentha in their capacity as privately appointed receivers and managers to Westpoint Corporation. The proposed release to the liquidators is limited to the hardcopy documents. ASIC released an image of the Westpoint server and associated computers in June 2006.

20 On 27 April 2007 ASIC filed an application under s 477(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) seeking orders that the liquidators of Westpoint Corporation be permitted to inspect and obtain copies of the books of the company held by ASIC subject to certain conditions relating to third party interests which were set out in the application.</text>
