<tocase>Rose and Frank Company v J. R. Crompton and Brothers, Limited [1923] 2 KB 261</tocase>
<text>38 It is quite possible for parties to come to an agreement by accepting a proposal with the result that the agreement concluded does not give rise to legal relations. The reason for this is that the parties do not intend that their agreement should give rise to legal relations. This intention may be implied from the subject matter of the agreement, but it may also be expressed by the parties. In social and family relations such an intention is readily implied, while in business matters the opposite result would ordinarily follow. However, even in business matters, there can be no reason why the parties should not intend to simply rely on each other's good faith and honour. If they clearly express such an intention, there can be no reason in public policy why effect should not be given to it (per Scrutton LJ in Rose and Frank Company v J. R. Crompton and Brothers, Limited ('Rose and Frank') [1923] 2 KB 261 at 288).

39 In Rose and Frank the English Court of Appeal was considering a signed memorandum purporting to set out the understanding between two English firms supplying carbon paper of various kinds and the American firm which was importing such carbon paper. The document included the following:
 
 'This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned to which they each honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence, based on past business with each other, that it will be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation.' 


 
The American firm sued the English firms for breach of the contract said to have arisen from the relevant memorandum. It was held that the document did not constitute a binding agreement.</text>

<text>40 An executed document becomes an agreement when and in the manner the parties intend that it should do so (see per Lord Greene, MR in Eccles v Bryant (1947) 2 All ER 865 at 869.3). At 866.9 Lord Greene said:
 
 'When parties are proposing to enter into a contract, the manner in which the contract is to be created so as to bind them must be gathered from the intentions of the parties, express or implied.'

<tocase>Australian (sic) and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. v Frost Holdings Pty Ltd. (1989) VR 695</tocase>
<text>41 The relevant principles in relation to the formation of a contract are conveniently summarised by Kaye J in his leading judgment in Australian (sic) and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. v Frost Holdings Pty Ltd. (1989) VR 695 at 700-701 as follows:
 
 ' "It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain, or at least its essential or critical terms, have been agreed upon. So, there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties"; per Sugarman J. (sic) in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, quoted on appeal with approval by Menzies J. in Thorby v. Goldberg [1964] HCA 41 ; (1964) 112 C.L.R. 597, at p.607. See also May and Butcher Ltd v. R. (H.L.) [1934] 2 K.B. 17, at p.20, per Lord Buckmaster and, at p.22, per Lord Warrington. 
 
 An agreement by a term of which a relevant or critical term will be the subject of future agreement between the parties is not enforceable. This general principle of the law of contract was stated by Viscount Dunedin in May and Butcher Ltd. v. R. , at p.21 in the following passage: "To be a good contract there must be a concluded bargain, and a concluded contract is one which settles everything that is necessary to be settled and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the parties. Of course it may leave something which still has to be determined, but then that determination must be a determination which does not depend upon the agreement between the parties. In the system of law in which I was brought up, that was expressed by one of those brocards of which perhaps we have been too fond, but which often express very neatly what is wanted: 'Certum est quod certum reddi potest.' Therefore, you may very well agree that a certain part of the contract of sale, such as price, may be settled by someone else. As a matter of the general law of contract all the essentials have to be settled. What are the essentials may vary according to the particular contract under consideration. We are here dealing with sale, and undoubtedly price is one of the essentials of sale, and if it is left still to be agreed between the parties, then there is no contract." 
 
 Referring to the same principle of law, Lord Wright in Scammell and Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston [1941] A.C. 251, at pp. 268-9 stated: "There are many cases in the books of what are called illusory contracts, that is, where the parties may have thought they were making a contract but failed to arrive at a definite bargain. It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable a court to give it a practical meaning. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties, that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain." 
 
 No doubt the principle is founded on recognition that the parties might subsequently fail to agree upon the undecided term, and that in such event the agreement would fail for want of agreement concerning a relevant term. The situation is distinguished from a contract made by parties leaving an essential term to be agreed upon by them, and if they fail to agree the disputed term is to be determined by a third party or by arbitration. ...'</text>

<tocase>Powell and Berry v Jones and Jones (1968) SASR 394</tocase>
<text>42 It is also useful to have regard to the statement of principle contained in the judgment of Bray CJ in Powell and Berry v Jones and Jones (1968) SASR 394 at 397 as follows:
 
 'It seems to me that there are four relevant categories of case where what at first sight looks like an enforceable contract subsequently turns out not to be one. No doubt these categories may and frequently do overlap and many cases fall within more than one of them. 
 
 1. The parties may have only agreed to agree. They may have left terms to be fixed by subsequent negotiation between them, their intention being that the provisions already agreed and those yet to be agreed shall operate together as one contract. Thorby v. Goldberg . 
 
 2. The parties may have made their agreement subject not only to the preparation but also to the execution of a formal document. In such a case, then, even though everything has in fact been agreed, either party may withdraw before the execution of such a document; e.g. Coope v. Ridout . Their intention must be taken to be that until such execution each of them has a locus poenitentiae . Many cases falling under this head also fall under the first. 
 
 3. The agreement may have left to the option of one party not only the mode of performance but whether there shall be any performance at all; e.g. Taylor v. Brewer . 
 
 4. There remains a residual class of case outside the first three categories where the agreement reached is so vague and uncertain that the court cannot give it any definite meaning at all. Cf. per Lord Wright in Scammell (G.) &amp; Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston (H. C. &amp; J. G.). '

<tocase>Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130</tocase>
<text>43 In Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 at 150-151, McHugh JA, as his Honour then was, said under the heading 'Was the consideration illusory?':
 
 'A contract made for a consideration which is illusory is unenforceable: Placer Development Ltd v The Commonwealth [1969] HCA 29 ; (1969) 121 CLR 353 at 356, 360-361 and Meehan v Jones [1982] HCA 52 ; (1982) 149 CLR 571 at 581. A consideration is illusory if its payment or fulfilment depends upon an unfettered discretion vested in the promisor.' 
 

To like effect Mr Justice Hope said at 143:
 
 'All these decisions show how far courts are prepared to go in order to find that there is an enforceable contractual promise where that is what the parties have intended. There are of course limitations. I have already referred to the case where the promisor has a discretion, not only as to what he shall do, but also as to whether he shall do anything. Such a promise is illusory. Furthermore it appears that the promise will not be enforceable if the manner of performance, including the amount of money to be paid or, if relevant, the number of shares to be offered, is a matter entirely in the discretion of the promisor and no criteria by which the performance required of the promisor can be measured, or the minimum of that performance can be measured, is expressed or can be found to be implied.'</text>

<tocase>The Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Limited [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/8.html</AustLII>
<text>44 The use of language which, as a matter of construction and not mere speculation, cannot be given any one meaning rather than another will defeat any intention of the parties to make a binding contract (per Menzies J in The Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Limited [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 441).

45 Cases may arise where a vague, uncertain, or meaningless clause in a contract can simply be ignored. Other like clauses may be waived by a party if inserted solely for the benefit of that party. However, a clause which is definitive of the ultimate rights which it is contemplated that a party will get under his contract is incapable of being so treated.

46 However, not all ambiguous contracts are to be found void for uncertainty. In The Council of the Upper Hunter County District v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Limited , Barwick CJ said at 436-7:
 
 '... a contract of which there can be more than one possible meaning or which when construed can produce in its application more than one result is not therefore void for uncertainty. As long as it is capable of a meaning, it will ultimately bear that meaning which the courts, or in an appropriate case, an arbitrator, decides is its proper construction: and the court or arbitrator will decide its application. The question becomes one of construction, of ascertaining the intention of the parties, and of applying it. Lord Tomlin's words in this connexion in Hillas &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd. ought to be kept in mind. So long as the language employed by the parties, to use Lord Wright's words in Scammell (G.) &amp; Nephew Ltd. v. Ouston is not "so obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the Court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intention", the contract cannot be held to be void or uncertain or meaningless. In the search for that intention, no narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial arrangements. Thus will uncertainty of meaning, as distinct from absence of meaning or of intention, be resolved.' 
 
 (footnotes omitted)

51 The primary duty of a court in construing a written contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the parties from the words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied. Of course the whole of the instrument has to be considered, since the meaning of any one part of it may be revealed by other parts, and the words of every clause must if possible be construed so as to render them all harmonious one with another. If the words used are unambiguous the court must give effect to them, notwithstanding that the result may appear capricious or unreasonable, and notwithstanding that it may be guessed or suspected that the parties intended something different. The court has no power to remake or amend a contract for the purpose of avoiding a result which is considered to be inconvenient or unjust. On the other hand, if the language is open to two constructions, that will be preferred which will avoid consequences which appear to be capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust, 'even though the construction adopted is not the most obvious, or the most grammatically accurate', to use the words from earlier authority cited in Locke v. Dunlop ((1888) 39 Ch D 387 at 393), which, although spoken in relation to a will, are applicable to the construction of written instruments generally; see also Bottomley's Case ((1880) 16 Ch D 681 at 686). Further, it will be permissible to depart from the ordinary meaning of the words of one provision so far as is necessary to avoid an inconsistency between that provision and the rest of the instrument. Finally, the statement of Lord Wright in Hillas and Co. Limited. v Arcos Limited. ((1932) 147 LT 503 at 514) that the court should construe commercial contracts 'fairly and broadly, without being too astute or subtle in finding defects', should not be understood as limited to documents drawn by businessmen for themselves and without legal assistance (cf. Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co. Ltd . [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 437) (per Gibbs J, as his Honour then was, in Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Limited [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109-110) .</text>

<tocase>Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/71.html</AustLII>
<text>47 In Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 the High Court held that a clause concerning the grant of a lease was uncertain for it did not prescribe either the term of the lease or the rent; and further that the provision for arbitration "as to the interpretation and operation" of the clause did not authorise an arbitrator to fix either the rent or the term. It was further held that since the uncertain term was a material and inseverable part of the contract, there was no concluded agreement between the parties. Kitto J at 456 said:
 
 '... the document does not record a consensus ad idem as to the duration of the term, the rent, or anything else except the commencing date and the premises intended to be let.' 
 

Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ said at 460-1:
 
 'We are firmly of opinion that the expression "upon such reasonable terms as govern such a lease" is not, in the context in which it appears, apt to refer to either the period for which the contemplated lease is to subsist or to the rent to be payable thereunder. Nor do we think that the further expression "as to the interpretation or operation" of this clause covers a dispute as to either of those matters. We, therefore, are of opinion that the clause is uncertain in that it neither specifies nor provides a means for the determination as between the parties of the period for which the contemplated lease shall be granted or the rent which shall be payable thereunder.' 


 
Their Honours proceeded to deal with the question of severability referring to the judgment of Knox CJ in Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd. v. Phillips [1925] HCA 18 ; (1925) 36 CLR 60 at 72 where his Honour said:
 
 'When a contract contains a number of stipulations one of which is void for uncertainty, the question whether the whole contract is void depends on the intention of the parties to be gathered from the instrument as a whole. If the contract be divisible, the part which is void may be separated from the rest and does not affect its validity.'

54 In seeking to ascertain the intention of the parties to a written contract extrinsic evidence may not be resorted to except where such evidence may be called in aid in the interpretation of the written instrument. Clearly enough, it is not to the point to make an independent examination of extrinsic facts, even if they were within the knowledge of both parties, and upon such evidence to conclude that a particular provision was or was not of importance to the parties or to either of them. The question for determination is the intention of the parties as disclosed by the contract into which they have entered (per Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ in Whitlock v Brew at 461).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/68.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Another illustration of a contract which was held to be void for uncertainty is to be found in Bishop v. Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518 where a contract for the sale of land included a condition which provided, inter alia, for 'one-third share of crops ... until end of peanut crop in 1968 or end of harvesting period ...' to be paid. The Court held that the condition was void for uncertainty because, upon construing it, one was unable to determine the term of the relevant sub-lease, the type of crop, or what 'one-third share of crops' meant. McTiernan and Taylor JJ said at 523:
 
 '... if it was intended that the lease should continue to subsist after the first year it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty for what period it was to subsist. The condition did not specify the nature of the crop or crops which the respondent might plant although, no doubt, it was contemplated that they would be peanuts. But the condition does not restrict him in his choice of crops and it may well be that it was for this reason that the condition provided, in effect, that the lease should subsist "until the end of peanut crop in 1968 or end of harvesting period or as otherwise agreed upon". The duration of the lease, therefore, it seems to us, was to depend upon what sort of crops had been sown for harvesting in 1968 and any agreement to grant a lease with the term so defined, or undefined, is void.' 
 

Menzies J said at 525:
 
 '... the condition of the contract for a sub-lease from the purchaser to the vendor of some part of the land, the subject of the contract, is one to which it is not possible by a process of construction to give any particular meaning. I agree entirely with what has been said about this condition being void for uncertainty.'</text>

<text>49 It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ).</text>

<tocase>Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/24.html</AustLII>
<text>52 Where the language of a contract has a plain meaning evidence of surrounding circumstances is not admissible to assist in the interpretation of the contract (per Mason J in Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales ('Codelfa') [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 352).

55 The relevant principle in relation to resort being had on matters of construction to extrinsic evidence is to be found in the judgment of Mason J, as his Honour then was, in Codelfa at 352 as follows:
 
 'The true rule is that evidence of surrounding circumstances is admissible to assist in the interpretation of the contract if the language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one meaning. But it is not admissible to contradict the language of the contract when it has a plain meaning. Generally speaking facts existing when the contract was made will not be receivable as part of the surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction, unless they were known to both parties, although, as we have seen, if the facts are notorious knowledge of them will be presumed. 
 
 It is here that a difficulty arises with respect to the evidence of prior negotiations. Obviously the prior negotiations will tend to establish objective background facts which were known to both parties and the subject matter of the contract. To the extent to which they have this tendency they are admissible. But in so far as they consist of statements and actions of the parties which are reflective of their actual intentions and expectations they are not receivable. The point is that such statements and actions reveal the terms of the contract which the parties intended or hoped to make. They are superseded by, and merged in, the contract itself. The object of the parol evidence rule is to exclude them, the prior oral agreement of the parties being inadmissible in aid of construction, though admissible in an action for rectification. 
 
 Consequently when the issue is which of two or more possible meanings is to be given to a contractual provision we look, not to the actual intentions, aspirations or expectations of the parties before or at the time of the contract, except in so far as they are expressed in the contract, but to the objective framework of facts within which the contract came into existence, and to the parties' presumed intention in this setting. We do not take into account the actual intentions of the parties and for the very good reason that an investigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but it would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weight to these factors at the expense of the actual language of the written contract.'

56 Terms may be implied in one of four ways (per Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 164 [28] ). These were summarised by Hodgson J in Carlton &amp; United Breweries Ltd v Tooth &amp; Co Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 11 June 1985) as follows:
 
 
 '(i) Implications contained in the express words of the contract: see Marcus Clarke (Vic) Ltd v Brown [1928] HCA 12 ; (1928) 40 CLR 540 at 553-4. 
 
 (ii) Implications from the "nature of the contract itself" as expressed in the words of the contract: see Liverpool City Council v Irwin [1976] UKHL 1 ; [1977] AC 239.

<tocase>Russell v Scott [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/34.html</AustLII>
<text>62 The presumption of a resulting trust that arises when property is transferred without consideration into the name of a person who is neither the child, adopted child or wife of the transferor, does no more than call for proof of an intention to confer beneficial ownership. Prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership, the presumption is rebutted (see Russell v Scott ('Russell v Scott') [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440 the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew).

131 Given Mr Ku's evidence that he prepared the 'Change to company details' form, a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1, before his meeting with Luke Song on 25 October, that it bears the date 23 October and was handed by Mr Ku to Mr Kim on 24 October with the request that Mr Kim forward it to ASIC in the express post envelope which Mr Ku provided, I have great difficulty in accepting that, when he was speaking with Luke Song on 25 October 2006, he said:
 
 'I will transfer all my shares of Kjun International Pty Ltd to your son first as good gesture if you sign this agreement.' 


 
It is unlikely that he would have used the words mentioned and in particular the word 'if' in circumstances where the 'Change to company details' form had already been prepared, signed and handed to his solicitor Mr Kim for transmission to ASIC in Melbourne.
 
I would place greater emphasis upon the words 'Everyone will say I am the most stupid person doing this but I value more our trust than who is got what and who has the right'. 
 
Equally, I have difficulty in accepting that the conversation included the words 'If anything goes wrong I didn't get a single dollar so I can get the shares back'. 
 
This is not a case where a resulting trust should be implied if it be found that the shares were duly transferred by Mr Ku to Ji Song. As was said in Russell v Scott there will be no resulting trust where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership. In my opinion such a transfer was intended in respect of the shares but not perfected, there being no duly executed share transfer form which was delivered to Ji Song or another person on his behalf.

132 Mr Ku says that, at the meeting on 25 October, he and Luke Song addressed the longer form of agreement which he had prepared on 24 October 2006. He said in relation to the consideration of the longer form of agreement:
 
 'We ran through all the clauses in the agreement one by one.'

133 Luke Song deposed to the production by Mr Ku of a document with clauses 'A' to 'G' on it. This is hardly illuminating. There was no form of agreement which included clauses A, B, C, D, E, F and G. There were, however, two different forms of agreement which began with 'A' and ended with 'G'. The longer form of agreement included clauses A, B, C, D, D (a second D), F and G. The shorter form of agreement contained clauses A, B, D, F and G.</text>

64 In rejecting the notion that a constructive trust will be imposed in accordance with idiosyncratic notions of what is just and fair Deane J in Muschinski acknowledged that general notions of fairness and justice are relevant to the traditional concept of unconscionable conduct, this being a concept which underlies fundamental equitable concepts and doctrines, including the constructive trust. His Honour pointed out that the constructive trust serves as a remedy which equity imposes regardless of actual or presumed agreement or intention to preclude the retention or assertion of beneficial ownership of property to the extent that such retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable principle (see per Mason CJ, Wilson and Deane JJ in Baumgartner v Baumgartner ('Baumgartner') [1987] HCA 59 ; (1987) 164 CLR 137 at 148.

65 In relation to the general equitable principle, which restores to a party contributions which he or she has made to a joint endeavour which fails when the contributions have been made in circumstances in which it was not intended that the other party should enjoy the benefit of them, to which Mason CJ, Wilson and Deane JJ referred in Baumgartner at 148, it was noted that Deane J had said in Muschinski :
 
 '... the principle operates in a case where the substratum of a joint relationship or endeavour is removed without attributable blame and where the benefit of money or other property contributed by one party on the basis and for the purposes of the relationship or endeavour would otherwise be enjoyed by the other party in circumstances in which it was not specifically intended or specially provided that that other party should so enjoy it. The content of the principle is that, in such a case, equity will not permit that other party to assert or retain the benefit of the relevant property to the extent that it would be unconscionable for him so to do: cf. Atwood v. Maude , and per Jessel M.R., Lyon v. Tweddell .'

<tocase>Barclays Bank Ltd. v Quistclose Investments Ltd. [1968] UKHL 4 ; [1970] AC 567</tocase>
<text>66 In Barclays Bank Ltd. v Quistclose Investments Ltd. ('Quistclose') [1968] UKHL 4 ; [1970] AC 567 the House of Lords accepted that money which had been given to Rolls Razor Ltd and banked into a special bank account to enable Rolls Razor Ltd to pay a dividend to its shareholders was impressed with a primary trust to pay the money out to the shareholders and a secondary trust to repay it to Quistclose Investments Ltd if the primary trust failed. As it transpires, Rolls Razor Ltd went into voluntary liquidation prior to the payment out of the dividend.

67 In Carreras Rothmans Ltd. v. Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd. [1985] 1 Ch 207 it was found that moneys paid by a company to an advertising agency, which were placed in a special account after the agency experienced financial difficulties, to be paid out to media interests with whom advertising had been placed for the company was held in trust by the agency for the payment over of the monies to the third party media interests. In that case Peter Gibson J explained the principle applied in Quistclose at 222 as follows:
 
 'In my judgment the principle in all these cases is that equity fastens on the conscience of the person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose. Most of the cases in this line are cases where there has been an agreement for consideration so that in one sense each party has contributed to providing the property. But if the common intention is that property is transferred for a specific purpose and not so as to become the property of the transferee, the transferee cannot keep the property if for any reason that purpose cannot be fulfilled.'

69 Commenting on the Quistclose litigation Gummow J said at 501:
 
 'But the essential reason why the insolvency law did not strike at the transaction in question in Quistclose was that the moneys represented by the cheque drawn by Quistclose in favour of Rolls Razor and banked in the special account of Rolls Razor never any at (sic) stage became the beneficial property of Rolls Razor. It acquired no more than what Dixon J called a dry legal interest: see [Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) v Commissioner of Stamp Duties of New South Wales [1941] HCA 15 ; (1941) 64 CLR 492] (at 510). On its part, Quistclose had both a contractual right to repayment out of the general assets of Rolls Razor, as a general creditor, and the beneficial interest in a fund, whether by way of resulting trust or as the second limb of an express trust.'

71 In Elizabethan Theatre Trust Gummow J observed that the debate in Quistclose had been confined to whether the material disclosed a trust in the terms which his Honour had described or merely a loan. His Honour then continued by saying at 503:
 
 '... But the facts in such cases are susceptible of infinite variation and the trust is a supple instrument. Hence the suggestion by Professor Finn that if the facts disclosed no contractual obligation by the borrower to the lender to pay the creditors, there could hardly be present a concurrent intention to create a trust in their favour; rather, the borrower would hold the moneys borrowed as trustee of an express trust for the lender, subject to a mandate for the lender (sic) to use the fund to pay the creditors. On that footing, there would be but one trust, created to give the lender security for its rescue operation of the financially unhealthy borrower, but not to render the creditors beneficiaries under any trust. ...'

72 Gummow J concluded his observations in respect of Quistclose by saying at 503:
 
 'To speak of a Quistclose trust as if it were a new legal institution rather than an example of the particular operation of principle upon the facts as found is to set the listener or reader off on a false path. ...'

73 It is evident that each case turns on its own facts. However, the principles which are to be applied are clear, as indicated above.

74 Two witnesses were called to give evidence in the applicant's case, namely Mr Ku and Mr Kim, a Queensland solicitor presently resident in South Korea. Three witnesses were called in the respondents' case, namely Luke Song, Sue Song and Ji Song.
 
It seemed to me that the Songs had a sense that Mr Ku had, metaphorically speaking, pulled the wool over their eyes and in particular those of Mrs Song, securing for himself advantages in respect of Sushi World to which he was not entitled. Likewise, it seemed to me that Mr Ku had a sense that he had helped the Songs develop and expand the Sushi World business, especially when Luke Song was absent from the business and Sue Song was tired, overworked and ill, in such a way as to entitle him to some worthwhile fruits from his endeavours.</text>

<text>68 In Re Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust; Lord v Commonwealth Bank of Australia ('Elizabethan Theatre Trust') (1991) 30 FCR 491 Gummow J held that moneys donated by third parties to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust, with a view to securing tax deductibility for the donations so made, with a request that preference be given by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust to the allocation of the moneys so donated to specific arts bodies associated with the Trust, did not result in the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust, which had entered into provisional liquidation, becoming the trustee of the monies so donated for the preferred arts bodies.
 
At 502 Gummow J observed:
 
 'The striking feature of the Quistclose litigation was that, whilst previously it might have been thought that debt and trust were distinct and disparate norms, it was thereafter clear that in a given case the transaction under analysis might bear a dual character.'

71 In Elizabethan Theatre Trust Gummow J observed that the debate in Quistclose had been confined to whether the material disclosed a trust in the terms which his Honour had described or merely a loan. His Honour then continued by saying at 503:

<text>108 Notwithstanding the suggestion by both sides that the conversation between Luke Song and Mr Ku on 19 October 2006 led to an 'agreement', I am not satisfied that the participants intended to enter into a legally binding contract on that day, even as between themselves (in this regard see Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 at [148] - [157] per Heydon JA). Furthermore, I am not satisfied that there was any promise on the part of Mr Ku to transfer the shares to Ji Song or that any such promise formed part of an agreement reached between Mr Ku and Luke Song in accordance with the principles enunciated above, for which there was any consideration. Luke Song did not want to make a commitment that would bind his wife without her authority and Mr Ku was going away to prepare a settlement agreement in documentary form for the parties to consider.

109 In my opinion, Mr Ku's proposal that he transfer the shares to Ji Song was simply an exercise undertaken at his instigation, directed at rebuilding a relationship of trust with the Songs. It was not directed at constituting Ji Song a trustee of the shares for Mr Ku. Rather, it was an act of faith, uninfluenced by any representations made by Luke Song or Sue Song. He was prepared to put his interest in Kjun International Pty Limited at risk, relying on Ji Song's beneficence to allow him to enjoy or share in it again.

110 The next meeting between Luke Song and Mr Ku took place on Wednesday 25 October, that is to say the day after Mr Ku prepared the shorter form of agreement, the longer form of agreement and the form of share transfer back from Ji Song to Mr Ku of shares in Kjun International Pty Limited.</text>

<tocase>Brunker v Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) [1937] HCA 29 ; (1937) 57 CLR 555</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/29.html</AustLII>
<text>114 An intended donee cannot obtain equitable remedies against the donor compelling him to give legal effect to his intention to give (per Dixon J, as his Honour then was, in Brunker v Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) ('Brunker') [1937] HCA 29 ; (1937) 57 CLR 555 at 599).

118 In relation to a transfer of real estate Dixon J said in Brunker at 602-3:
 
 'Further, I think that the donee must obtain property in the piece of paper itself and property in the paper could pass only by delivery ( Cochrane v Moore ). If property in the transfer remained in the transferor, his power of recalling it must also remain. For he would be entitled to possession of the paper, he could refuse to present it for registration and he could destroy it.' 
 
 (footnote omitted)

119 As has already been observed no instrument of transfer of the shares was brought into existence, executed by Mr Ku or delivered to Ji Song or any agent for him.

120 In his affidavit sworn 28 June 2007 (sic) at paragraph 15 Mr Ku said:
 
 
 '15 Prior to going to the meeting with Luke Song [on 25 October 2006] I had been with a solicitor ... Mr Y Kim. ... I gave to Mr Kim the original transfer in the express post envelope and asked him to send it. ... Later I became aware ... that the share transfer had not gone through and I said I would check what had happened. ... Later when I checked with Mr Kim and realised he had not sent the transfer I did phone Luke Song and say I would do the transfer on the internet. ...' 
 


The so-called 'original transfer' was plainly the original of the 'Change to company details' form , a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1.</text>

<tocase>Anning v Anning [1907] HCA 13 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1049</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1907/13.html</AustLII>
<text>115 In respect of the requirement that for a gift to be effective the donor must have done all that was 'necessary to be done', 'necessary' means 'necessary for the purpose of passing the property'. The word is not used in an obligatory sense. The donor is under no necessity, no obligation. What the Courts look at is what the donor might have done to perfect the gift (per Higgins J in Anning v Anning ('Anning') [1907] HCA 13 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1049 at 1082).

116 There is nothing unconscientious in a donor refusing at any stage to perfect a mere bounty (per Isaacs J in Anning at 1063). In Anning Griffith CJ opined at 1057:
 
 '... in the case of shares in a company which are only transferable by an instrument of transfer lodged with the company, I think that the donor has done all that is necessary on his part as soon as he has executed the transfer'

117 It seems to me that not only would execution of a transfer be necessary, but also delivery of that transfer to the donee and whatever else may be necessary to enable the donee to secure registration of the transfer.</text>

<tocase>Henjo Investments Pty Limited v Collins Marrickville Pty Limited (1988) 79 ALR 83</tocase>
<text>202 (a) Whilst the possibility of a transfer of shares from Mr Ku to Ji Song had been the subject of prior discussion, in the context of a possible settlement of the trade mark proceedings, it was raised by Mr Ku for the first time at the Avillion Hotel on 19 October 2006.
 (b) Mr Ku indicated his intention to transfer the shares to Ji Song with a view to effecting a gift inter vivos of those shares.
 (c) On 23 October 2006 Mr Ku executed a 'Change to company details' form (see Schedule 1) which he believed would, upon being recorded by ASIC, have the effect of validly transferring the shares to Ji Song.
 (d) On 24 October 2006 Mr Ku gave the original of the 'Change to company details' form signed by him and dated 23 October 2006 to Mr Kim so that Mr Kim might forward it to ASIC.
 (e) Mr Kim never forwarded the signed document to ASIC. On or about 9 November 2006 he threw it into his rubbish bin.
 (f) No proper instrument of transfer of the one share in Kjun International Pty Limited that was held by him as at 23 October 2006 or of any other shares, as required by s 1071B(2) of the Corporations Act , was ever executed by Mr Ku, delivered by him to Ji Song or delivered by him to Kjun International Pty Limited for registration.
 (g) In accordance with clause 32 of Kjun International Limited's constitution, Mr Ku remained the holder of whatever shares he may have held in Kjun International Pty Limited, notwithstanding his electronic lodgement on 9 November 2006 of the 'Change to company details' form with ASIC (see Schedule 2). The prima facie evidence of a transfer from Mr Ku to Ji Song (under s 1274B(2)) was negated by the evidence that no transfer was ever executed or delivered. This is now common ground.
 (h) Mr Ku never did everything that was necessary to be done in order to transfer any shares in Kjun International Pty Limited to Ji Song and render himself bound by his intended gift inter vivos.
 (i) No question of an implied resulting trust or any other form of trust or of a collateral contract to constitute a trust, arises.
 (j) No mention of Mr Ku's intended gift of the shares or any other shares was made in either form of agreement as signed by Luke Song and Mr Ku on 25 October 2006, even though the common understanding of the parties at that time was that the 'Change to company details' form (Schedule 1) had not been received or recorded by ASIC at that stage.
 (k) When at the Avillion Hotel on 25 October 2006, Luke Song and Mr Ku considered in detail the terms of the longer form of agreement with a view to effecting a settlement of the trade mark proceedings.
 (l) They then proceeded to execute the longer form of agreement and also inadvertently signed the shorter form of agreement. Neither party was under the influence of alcohol or unable to read and approve the terms of the agreements which were executed.
 (m) The parties intended that their execution of the longer form of agreement, but not the shorter form, should give rise to legal relations.
 (n) At the time of the execution of the longer form of agreement, the proper parties to the trade mark proceedings were:
 Song interests LSU Pty Limited as trustee of the Nirvana Investment Trust 

Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited
 
Sue Song
 
Luke Song
 
 Ku interests Kjun International Pty Limited 

Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited
 
 (o) When Luke Song executed the longer form of agreement he intended to bind not only Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited, Sue Song and Luke Song, but also LSU Pty Limited as trustee of the Nirvana Investment Trust.
 (p) When Mr Ku executed the longer form of agreement he intended to bind not only Kjun International Pty Limited but also Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited.
 (q) It is clear from paragraphs B, D, D [the second D], F and G in the longer form of agreement that Luke Song and Mr Ku intended the party described as 'A' to include all the respondents in the trade mark proceedings and by the party described as 'B' in that form of agreement to include all the applicants in those proceedings.
 (r) As at 25 October 2006 Luke Song was the sole director of Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited and he, together with Sue Song, were the directors of LSU Pty Limited.
 (s) In my opinion, it may be inferred that Sue Song authorised Luke Song to enter into a settlement agreement at some time between 19 and 25 October 2006 on her own behalf and also on behalf of LSU Pty Limited and that the longer form of agreement contained terms which were within the scope of Luke Song's authority.
 (t) As at 25 October 2006 Mr Ku was the sole director of Kjun International Pty Limited and also Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited. As such, he had authority to bind both of those companies to a settlement agreement.
 (u) The longer form of agreement was not void for uncertainty. Its terms may be ascertained from the words used in the longer form of agreement and the relevant surrounding circumstances.
 (v) The reference in clause G of the settlement agreement to the parties' agreement to 'solve all problems harmoniously through a mutual talk and agreement, and help and cooperate with each other for mutual development without slandering each other' did not constitute an agreement to agree. Rather the words were indicative of a promise by the parties to use their respective best endeavours to resolve future disputes that may arise between them by negotiation, bringing to bear goodwill in so doing.
 (w) The settlement agreement provided for the applicants in the trade mark proceedings to refrain from continuing those proceedings and to refrain from bringing any further claims against the respondents arising out of the disputes between them in relation to the trade mark. It may be inferred that the applicants in the trade mark proceedings agreed to file a notice of discontinuance with the consent of the respondents.
 (x) The agreement also provided for no claims to be brought by the respondents against the applicants in the trade mark proceedings arising out of those disputes. Whilst the second clause D speaks of ' If "B" withdraws the lawsuit against "A" brought in the Federal Court of Australia New South Wales District Registry, "A" accepts it without reservation and agrees that there will not be any legal proceedings against "B" from "A"' (emphasis added), it is clear from the terms of the agreement and, in particular, the preamble to clause G that by the agreement the parties mutually agreed that they would 'not continue' with their respective claims so that no right was reserved to the respondents in the trade mark proceedings to institute their cross-claim as they did on 9 November 2006, in the absence of a formal notice of discontinuance to be filed by the applicants with the consent of the respondents in the trade mark proceedings.
 (y) The settlement agreement recognised the rights of Kjun International Pty Limited to the trade mark 'Su-shi World' and the continuation of the licensing arrangement, such as it was, whereby Sushi Nara Australia Pty Limited acted as a franchisor of the 'Sushi World' name. It provided for a recognition of the rights of the parties presently using the 'Sushi World' name in respect of shops, to continue to do so, and it conferred a right on the respondents in the trade mark proceedings to 'open new Sushi World' shops.
 (z) Notwithstanding the settlement agreement which had been concluded, the respondents, including JHJ Brothers Holdings Pty Limited, filed their cross-claim in the trade mark proceedings on 9 November 2006 and proceeded to serve same on 13 November 2006 (see [27]-[28] above). Furthermore, Ji Song purported to remove Mr Ku as a director, secretary and public officer of Kjun International Pty Limited, replacing him with Sue Song (see Edwin Davey's letter of 15 December 2006). Needless to say, the purported removal and replacement of Mr Ku by Sue Song was of no force and effect given that Ji Song never became the holder of any shares in Kjun International Pty Limited.
 (aa) By their conduct in filing and serving the cross-claim as they did, the respondents in the trade mark proceedings repudiated the settlement agreement reached on 25 October 2006. That repudiation was accepted by the applicants in the trade mark proceedings on 18 December 2006 thereby terminating the settlement agreement.
 (bb) In the circumstances, the restraints imposed upon the parties in relation to continuing the trade mark proceedings, whether as applicants or cross-claimants, came to an end with the consequence that the trade mark proceedings may now proceed to a hearing.
 (cc) None of the conduct engaged in by any of the Songs or Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited whether by action or omission constituted misleading and deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or deceive. The circumstances which prevailed between 25 October and 9 November 2006 did not give rise to an obligation on the part of the Songs or any of them to disclose any intention that they may have had to file a cross-claim on 9 November 2006 nor did the circumstances give rise to an obligation upon them or any of them to disclose the fact that the cross-claim had been filed following its filing on 9 November 2006 and before its service on 13 November 2006 (see Henjo Investments Pty Limited v Collins Marrickville Pty Limited (1988) 79 ALR 83 at 94-5).
 (dd) Su-shi World Australia Pty Limited did not engage in any unconscionable conduct within the meaning of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act .

203 In the foregoing circumstances, the applicant in the current proceedings has failed in respect of the claims as articulated in paragraphs 1 4 and 5 8 of the Second Further Amended Application filed on 6 August 2007. However, he is entitled to a declaration that the third respondent has no right, title or interest in any shares in the fourth respondent and also a declaration that the purported removal of the applicant as a director, secretary and public officer of the fourth respondent and the purported replacement of the applicant as a director, secretary and public officer of the fourth respondent by the first respondent, by the third respondent's resolution signed and dated 15 December 2006, was of no force and effect.

204 Given the basis upon which the case has been decided and the late emergence of evidence, which, if addressed prior to the commencement of the proceedings, may have obviated the need for the proceedings, the question of costs should be reserved for later decision. I propose to direct that the parties file and serve written submissions thereon within 7 days.
