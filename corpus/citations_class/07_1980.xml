<text>37 In my opinion, the question of whether there was even an arguable case of fraud raised before the Federal Magistrate is finely balanced. Counsel for the Minister referred to the transcript of the hearing before the Federal Magistrate and reminded me of the fact that strong evidence is usually required to establish fraud. He referred to Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336. There is considerable force in the Minister's submissions. The appellant appears to have changed his story on whether his signature appears on one of the documents. More importantly perhaps is that, on the face of it, it is difficult to discern a motive for any fraudulent dealing on the part of Mr Lue. Despite these considerations, I do not think I should go so far as to conclude that on no possible view of the evidence before the Federal Magistrate could fraud be established. If the appellant's signature was falsely placed on a relevant document and part of a statement "made up", then that may go some way towards establishing fraud, although it will still be necessary for the appellant to show that the fraud (if there be fraud) has affected the process prescribed by the Act . I am not to be taken as saying that it is likely that fraud will be made out, but simply that I cannot be certain that it cannot be made out. It seems to me that the application for constitutional writs must be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for rehearing in accordance with these reasons. I am satisfied that the circumstances are such that a rehearing of the application is necessary.

38 The appeal must be allowed and the orders made by the Federal Magistrate on 29 January 2007 must be set aside. The application is remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia for rehearing in accordance with these reasons. I will hear the parties on the question of costs.

 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365</tocase>

<text>24 The Magistrate said that the appellant's claim was that he was unaware of the proposed Tribunal hearing on 2 December 2004 because his agent did not tell him about it. He noted that the appellant described the agent's conduct as "wrongful" and that the written submissions filed by counsel for the appellant sought to separate the issue of wrongful conduct into fraudulent and non-fraudulent conduct. The Magistrate said that while some authorities suggested that such a dichotomy might have been a useful one in proceedings, recent decisions binding on him led to a different conclusion. The Magistrate referred to various sections in the Migration Act and decisions of this Court, including the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 (" SZFDE "). The Magistrate took the view that an agent's wrongful conduct, whether fraudulent or not, in failing to inform an applicant of a hearing of the Tribunal of which notification had been given did not give rise to jurisdictional error. The Federal Magistrate did not make an express finding to the effect that the appellant's agent did not advise him of the proposed hearing before the Tribunal because he said that even if that were so it did not affect the result. He said that the outcome of the application for constitutional writs in relation to the decision of the Tribunal did not turn on whether or not the agent's conduct in not informing the appellant of the proposed Tribunal hearing was fraudulent. The Magistrate said:
 
 Therefore, the Tribunal was entitled under the Act to proceed to a determination notwithstanding that the applicant may not have been informed by his agent of the Tribunal's proposed hearing, with the result that the Tribunal's decision is not affected by jurisdictional error on this account.

25 As I have said, the Federal Magistrate did not find it necessary to make findings as to whether the appellant was aware of the proposed hearing of the Tribunal or whether, assuming he was not aware, that came about as a result of fraud or negligence or mistake on the part of Mr Lue.</text>

<text>27 The respondent in SZFDE sought and obtained from the High Court of Australia special leave to appeal against the decision of the Full Court of this Court. The appeal was heard on 24 May 2007 and, on 2 August 2007, the High Court handed down its decision. The Court reversed the decision of the Full Court of this Court: SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 81 ALJR 1401.

28 The appellant submitted that the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed to determine the application for review even though he (the appellant) had not been informed of the proposed hearing of the Tribunal.

29 For his part, the Minister sought an extension of the time within which to file and serve a notice of contention. On 6 June 2007 I granted that extension of time. The notice of contention is in the following terms:
 
 The first respondent contends that the judgment of Federal Magistrate Cameron should be affirmed on the following grounds (not being grounds relied upon by the court below):
 
 
 
 1. There was no evidence before Federal Magistrate Cameron upon which the Court could have found that the applicant's adviser had fraudulently failed to inform the applicant of the hearing before the Tribunal; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. Federal Magistrate Cameron should have rejected the applicant's contention that his adviser had fraudulently failed to inform the applicant of the hearing before the Tribunal.</text>
