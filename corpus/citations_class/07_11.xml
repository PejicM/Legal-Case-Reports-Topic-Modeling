<text>2 On 19 December 2006, I delivered judgment in relation to the claims brought by the ACCC against the CEPU, except for the claims relating to penalty and costs: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Amongst other relief, I said that I would grant the following declarations in relation to the CEPU's accessorial conduct: 
 
 '1. Prior to August 2001, the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors, and in those circumstances, in August 2001, the Second Respondent: 
 (a) aided, abetted, counselled, procured and induced the First Respondent to make; and 
 (b) was knowingly concerned in and party to the First Respondent making, 
 a contract, arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent which contained a provision that: 
 (c) the First Respondent would not engage a Contractor to perform work at the Loy Yang B power station in Victoria unless that Contractor had a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent; and 
 (d) was included in the contract, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of preventing or hindering the First Respondent from acquiring goods or services from Contractors who did not have a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent, 
 with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s 45E(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 
 
 2. Prior to August 2001, the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors, and in those circumstances, in August 2001, the Second Respondent counselled, procured and induced the First Respondent to give effect to the provision of the contract, arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent referred to in paragraph 1 of these declarations, with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s 45EA of the Trade Practices Act .' 


I also held that the ACCC was entitled to injunctive relief against the CEPU.

3 For convenience, I will adopt the terms defined in my principal judgment for the purposes of these reasons for judgment.

4 The ACCC sought orders that a pecuniary penalty be imposed on the CEPU pursuant to s 76 of the TPA and that the CEPU pay the ACCC's costs of the proceedings against the CEPU on an indemnity basis. The CEPU disputes that it should pay the ACCC's costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis. At the request of the parties, I heard submissions on penalty on 22 December 2006 and deferred the question of costs. I was informed by the parties that this course was necessary because both parties had made Calderbank offers during the course of the proceedings and that it was not possible to address the question of indemnity costs until the Court has determined what penalty should be imposed on the CEPU. These reasons for judgment are therefore confined to the question of penalty.</text>

<text>8 There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which govern the imposition of a penalty under s 76(1). The relevant principles have been discussed at length in numerous cases: see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 ( 'CSR' ) at 52,151 52,153 per French J; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 ( 'NW Frozen Foods' ) at 291-295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 127 FCR 170 at 172 173 [2]-[6] per Sackville J and at 181 184 [47]-[60] per Merkel J; J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2000) 172 ALR 532 ( 'McPhee' ) at 577-579 [158]-[166]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 564 ( 'Visy Paper (No 2)' ) at 571-572 [28]-[32] per Sackville J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2 ) (2005) 215 ALR 281 at 283 285 [5]-[12] per Merkel J; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301 ( 'Leahy (No 3)' ) at 307-311 [31]-[43] per Goldberg J.

10 In CSR at 52,152 52,153, French J identified six additional factors:
 
 (i) the size of the contravening company;
 (ii) the degree of its power, evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market;
 (iii) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;
 (iv) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;
 (v) whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the TPA, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and
 (vi) whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the TPA in relation to the contravention. 

These factors were approved by Burchett and Kiefel JJ, with whom Carr J agreed, in NW Frozen Foods at 292.

13 Deterrence is the principal object of the penalties regime. In CSR at 52,152, French J said that the principal, and he thought probably the only, object of the penalties imposed by s 76 is to attempt to put a price on contravention that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the TPA. His Honour also observed that it is conducive to deterrence to adopt an approach under which the greater the scope and impact of the conduct, the heavier the penalty should be: at 52,153.

14 In NW Frozen Foods at 293 295, Burchett and Kiefel JJ said that the deterrent effect of a penalty, both specific and general, is an important factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty in a particular case, although it must also be borne in mind that the penalty should not be so great as to be oppressive.

60 The ACCC said that the existence of a trade practices compliance program was 'possibly relevant' to the determination of penalty. I do not see any need for the qualification added by the ACCC. In my opinion, the introduction of a compliance program in 2004, and its continuing operation, is a relevant factor in determining penalty: see CSR per French J at 52,123; and NW Frozen Foods at 293-294 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ. In Rural Press at 43,291 [22], Mansfield J said: 
 
 'The fact that, following a contravention, a contravening entity has implemented at its own expense a trade practices compliance program to ensure its compliance and that of its employees and agents with the Act, will also be a consideration which will mitigate the level of a pecuniary penalty: NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner (1997) ATPR |P41-546; (1996) 141 ALR 640...; Prestige Motors . Such conduct gives some confidence that the particular contravener will not engage in similar conduct in the future, and it may also be assumed would come to the knowledge of the community through the reasons given when fixing penalty, so as also to serve the purpose of community deterrence.' 


I agree with these observations.</text>

<text>8 There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which govern the imposition of a penalty under s 76(1). The relevant principles have been discussed at length in numerous cases: see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 ( 'CSR' ) at 52,151 52,153 per French J; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 ( 'NW Frozen Foods' ) at 291-295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 127 FCR 170 at 172 173 [2]-[6] per Sackville J and at 181 184 [47]-[60] per Merkel J; J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2000) 172 ALR 532 ( 'McPhee' ) at 577-579 [158]-[166]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 564 ( 'Visy Paper (No 2)' ) at 571-572 [28]-[32] per Sackville J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2 ) (2005) 215 ALR 281 at 283 285 [5]-[12] per Merkel J; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301 ( 'Leahy (No 3)' ) at 307-311 [31]-[43] per Goldberg J.

16 In McPhee , the Full Court (comprising Black CJ, Lee and Goldberg JJ) reviewed the authorities, including Stihl , Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 298 and Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 ( 'TNT' ) at 40,166, in which the courts attached importance to the deliberateness of the contravening conduct. The Full Court concluded that in fixing penalties under s 76 it is appropriate and relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the TPA was systematic, deliberate or covert: at 577 [158] and at 579 [163]. In doing so, the Court does not stray into irrelevant moral considerations.

30 The decision of Mansfield J in Rural Press illustrates the proposition that s 76(3) and the totality principle can produce similar results. His Honour said at 43,290 [19]:
 
 'The ACCC is correct in stressing that, as I have found, the conduct of the respondents involved two contraventions of s 45 of the Act, namely the making of an arrangement and separately carrying it into effect. In a practical sense, I consider that the conduct that constituted the first of those contraventions was "part and parcel" of the conduct that constituted the second of those contraventions: see for example J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2000) ATPR |P41-758; (2000) 172 ALR 532 ( "McPhee" ), per Black CJ, Lee and Goldberg JJ at ATPR 40,923; FCR 583 [182]. However, although the conduct constituting the contraventions of s 46 was also closely allied to that conduct, in my view the contraventions of s 46 are separate and could be dealt with separately. For the reasons proposed by the ACCC, and accepted by the respondents, I will however impose one penalty upon each respondent for the contraventions of the Act by that particular respondent, or in which that particular respondent was involved. In this matter, the level of pecuniary penalty which I impose would not alter whether the s 45 and s 46 contraventions had to be treated as part and parcel of the one set of conduct by reason of s 76(3) or were capable of being treated as separate contraventions.'

31 In McPhee at 583 [181]-[183], the Full Court considered the imposition of penalties for making and giving effect to an arrangement or understanding in contravention of s 45. The Court concluded that s 76(3) applied because the conduct which constituted the second contravention of giving effect to the arrangement was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention of making the arrangement: 
 
 'The case presented to his Honour did not distinguish the conduct of McPhee involving the formation of the proscribed arrangement or understanding from the conduct of McPhee said to constitute giving effect to such arrangement or understanding. According to the Commission's case, the delivery by Mr Webb to Mr Jolly of McPhee's rates was an integral part of the conduct that constituted the contravention of s 45 in making, or arriving at, an understanding or arrangement. That same act was also relied upon by the Commission as the act which constituted the further contravention by McPhee of giving effect to the arrangement or understanding. 
 
 If the disclosure by McPhee to DFE of the rates charged by McPhee to ACI Florapak could be said to be an act giving effect to an arrangement or understanding already made or arrived at, it was not conduct distinguishable from the conduct of McPhee which constituted the making of such an arrangement or understanding. Pursuant to s 76(3) of the Act, if conduct constitutes a contravention of two or more provisions of Pt IV , a proceeding may be instituted in respect of each contravention but a person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty in respect of the same conduct. This was not a case involving repeated conduct concerning discrete events occurring at different times and involving disparate parties: Trade Practices Commission v Simpson Pope Ltd (1980) 30 ALR 544; 47 FLR 334 at 336 per Franki J. 
 
 We therefore accept the submission that his Honour erred in imposing separate penalties in respect of the ACI Florapak conduct. The conduct which constituted the second contravention was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention and s 76(3) prescribed that only one penalty could be imposed.'

37 Another difficulty with the ACCC's submission is that, as in McPhee , the ACCC conducted the trial without attempting to draw any distinction between the conduct on the part of the CEPU that was relevant to its involvement in Edison's contravention of s 45E(3) and that which was relevant to Edison's contravention of s 45EA. Quite the contrary; the ACCC relied on the same conduct for its contention that the CEPU was involved in both contraventions. This is confirmed by paras 41 and 42 of the ACCC's amended statement of claim. At trial, senior counsel for the ACCC expressly submitted that the ACCC relied on the same conduct by the CEPU over a relatively short period of time between 9 August and 23 August 2001 in connection with both contraventions.

38 The ACCC's submission fails to take into account the full ambit of my findings concerning the contract, arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU. In my principal judgment, I found that prior to 23 August 2001 Edison and the CEPU made or entered into an arrangement that included a provision that Edison would not engage electrical contractors to perform work at Loy Yang B unless they have a certified agreement with the CEPU prior to commencing work at the site: at [142]. However, I also found that the heads of agreement was entered into on 23 August 2001 in accordance with, and was controlled by, this broader arrangement: at [142] and [173]. Even if the heads of agreement were the only relevant arrangement between Edison and the CEPU, I concluded that cl 4.1 of the heads of agreement constituted a provision that was included in the heads of agreement for a purpose which infringed s 45E(3): at [192]. When I turned to consider the CEPU's liability as an accessory to Edison's contraventions of ss 45E and 45EA, I pointed out that the evidence established that the CEPU made demands which instigated, induced and procured Edison to make both the broader arrangement and the heads of agreement: at [220]. In these circumstances, the implementation steps which the CEPU took on 15 and 23 August 2001 can be regarded as actions by which the CEPU induced, counselled or procured Edison to sign the heads of agreement, which relevantly formed part of the contravening arrangement. Put another way, there is no reason to conclude that the implementation steps which the CEPU took on 15 and 23 August 2001 are relevant only to the contravention of s 45EA and not to the contravention of s 45E(3). In my opinion, they are relevant to both, given the findings I have made concerning the heads of agreement and the relationship between the heads of agreement and the broader arrangement that Edison and the CEPU made some days earlier.

39 For the sake of completeness, I note that the ACCC advanced a different argument in its written submissions on penalty, but it did not pursue that argument in its oral submissions. Shortly stated, the argument was that the CEPU's conduct in relation to s 45EA included its failure to prevent the continuation of Edison's new practice between August 2001 and November 2003. The ACCC did not advance this argument at the principal hearing and, assuming it was not abandoned during the penalty hearing, it is now too late to raise it. At all relevant times, the ACCC's case was that the CEPU was involved in Edison's contravention of s 45EA because the CEPU had counselled, procured or induced Edison to give effect to the offending provision by means of the demands which the CEPU made to Edison in the period leading up to Edison's execution of the heads of agreement on 23 August 2001. At the principal hearing, senior counsel for the ACCC submitted that the ACCC could not point to anything that the CEPU did after the making of the arrangement on or about 23 August that made it an accessory to Edison's contravention of s 45EA. The ACCC did not mount a case that the CEPU policed or sought to enforce the arrangement after it was entered into in August 2001. The ACCC did not ask any questions of Burns or Sutherland or any other witness to the effect that the CEPU had taken any steps to enforce the arrangement after it was entered into in August 2001.

42 If the CEPU's conduct that is relevant to Edison's contravention of s 45EA can be distinguished from its conduct in relation to the s 45E(3) contravention, with the consequence that s 76(3) does not apply, I consider that the approach described in Allied Mills , Advance Bank and in McPhee at 584 [185] should be applied in the circumstances of this case. In substance, the CEPU engaged in a single course of conduct that was related and interlocking and which involved it in both contraventions. To my mind, it would be artificial to distinguish between the conduct that is relevant to the making of the arrangement and that which is relevant to Edison's giving effect to the arrangement. The CEPU's conduct in relation to the two contraventions is so interconnected that the appropriate course is to apply the totality principle to set a penalty for the CEPU's accessorial conduct in respect of one breach and to take the CEPU's involvement in the other breach into account. Adopting that approach, I have concluded that the appropriate penalty would not differ from that which I would impose on the basis that s 76(3) applies.</text>

<text>12 As the wording of s 76(1) indicates, the factors enumerated above are not exhaustive and other considerations may be relevant in a particular case: Trade Practices Commission v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd (No 3) (1994) ATPR 41-363 at 42,723; and Leahy (No 3) at 308 [33] per Goldberg J. It is also necessary to bear in mind that s 76 covers a range of different classes of contravention under Pt IV of the TPA to which different considerations may be relevant.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Aust) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091</tocase>
<text>15 Much earlier in the history of the TPA, Smithers J expressed similar views in Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Aust) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 ( 'Stihl' ) at 17,896:
 
 'The penalty should constitute a real punishment proportionate to the deliberation with which the defendant contravened the provisions of the Act. It should be sufficiently high to have a deterrent quality, and it should be kept in mind that the Act operates in a commercial environment where deterrence of those minded to contravene its provisions is not likely to be achieved by penalties which are not realistic. It should reflect the will of Parliament that the commercial standards laid down in the Act must be observed, but not be so high as to be oppressive.'

16 In McPhee , the Full Court (comprising Black CJ, Lee and Goldberg JJ) reviewed the authorities, including Stihl , Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 298 and Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 ( 'TNT' ) at 40,166, in which the courts attached importance to the deliberateness of the contravening conduct. The Full Court concluded that in fixing penalties under s 76 it is appropriate and relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the TPA was systematic, deliberate or covert: at 577 [158] and at 579 [163]. In doing so, the Court does not stray into irrelevant moral considerations.</text>

<text>16 In McPhee , the Full Court (comprising Black CJ, Lee and Goldberg JJ) reviewed the authorities, including Stihl , Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 298 and Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 ( 'TNT' ) at 40,166, in which the courts attached importance to the deliberateness of the contravening conduct. The Full Court concluded that in fixing penalties under s 76 it is appropriate and relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the TPA was systematic, deliberate or covert: at 577 [158] and at 579 [163]. In doing so, the Court does not stray into irrelevant moral considerations.

19 Depending on the circumstances of the case, other principles may also be relevant. Where the relevant conduct gives rises to several contraventions of the TPA, it will be relevant to take into account the totality principle to ensure that the total penalty does not exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct in question: see Trade Practices Commission v Advance Bank Australia Ltd (1993) ATPR 41-229 ( 'Advance Bank' ) at 41,164 per Gummow J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 ( 'ABB Transmission' ) at 179-180 [38]-[39]; TNT at 40,169. The parity principle, ie all other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties, will have direct application where penalties are being imposed on several contravening respondents. The principle also draws attention, albeit less directly, to the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. There is, of course, a limit to the usefulness of any comparison with past penalties: the circumstances of particular cases are likely to differ in significant respects and each case must be considered by reference to its own circumstances: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763 ( 'George Weston' ) at 40,984 [31] per Goldberg J.

23 The CEPU also advanced a number of alternative submissions. First, it submitted that its conduct should be viewed as a single course of conduct, attracting one penalty only, even if it were possible to draw some distinction between the conduct that was relevant to s 45E and that which was relevant to s 45EA. In support of this submission, the CEPU relied upon Advance Bank at 41,164 per Gummow J; ABB Transmission at 179-180 [38] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-833 ( 'Rural Press' ) at 43,290 [16]-[17]. Further or alternatively, the CEPU submitted that if this approach could not be adopted, its conduct in relation to the two contraventions was so interconnected that, by the application of the totality principle, the Court ought to arrive at a penalty of the same magnitude as if it were dealing with a single contravention: see Rural Press at 43,290 [19] and TNT at 40,169.

28 In Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256 ( 'Allied Mills' ) at 258, Sheppard J was required to assess penalties in relation to price fixing contraventions of s 45 of the TPA. His Honour said that where more than one breach of s 45 is alleged and admitted, it would not be appropriate to impose substantive penalties for each breach because each arises out of the one transaction, namely, the arrangement or understanding alleged in the amended statement of claim. In taking this course, Sheppard J followed the approach adopted by Kitto J in imposing penalties for breaches of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in L Vogel &amp; Son Pty Ltd v Anderson (Minister for Customs) [1967] HCA 46 ; (1968) 120 CLR 157 at 164-165. Sheppard J's approach was followed in TNT at 40,169. These cases involved applications of the totality principle rather than s 76(3).

32 The Full Court added at 584 [185] that, if s 76(3) did not apply, the totality principle should have been applied because of the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the two contraventions: 
 
 'If it could be said that the conduct relevant to the two contraventions was not the same conduct for the purpose of s 76(3) , we would be of the opinion that his Honour's discretion in calculating the appropriate penalty to be imposed miscarried, in that his Honour failed to have regard to the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the two contraventions and to the need to set a total penalty appropriate in the circumstances. On the particular facts of this case, it was not appropriate to impose a substantive penalty for each breach of the Act arising as they did out of the one transaction. The appropriate course was to set a penalty for the conduct imposed in respect of one breach and to take the other breach into account: Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (1981) 37 ALR 256; 60 FLR 1 per Sheppard J at FLR 40; Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd , above, at 40,169; McDonald v R (1994) 48 FCR 555; 120 ALR 629. For the reasons we have set out above, we consider that the appropriate total of penalty would have been a sum of $500,000.' 


The penalty of $500,000 was the same figure that the Full Court considered to be the appropriate penalty on the footing that s 76(3) did apply.

61 It is a well accepted principle that, in the assessment of a penalty, a respondent who withdraws defences and acknowledges liability, and thereby saves the community the costs of a lengthy trial, is entitled to special consideration in reduction of the penalty that would otherwise be assessed: NW Frozen Foods at 293-294 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; TNT at 40,169 40,170 per Burchett J; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993 at 48,626 48,630 [49]-[71] per Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ. The extent of the discount will depend, inter alia, upon whether the respondent's co-operation with the ACCC indicates a resolve to comply with the law, thereby reducing the need for specific deterrence: see Leahy (No 3) at 309-310 [40]-[41] per Goldberg J.

64 The ACCC's submission is unacceptable as a matter of general principle and runs counter to settled authority in this Court. In TNT at 40,170, Burchett J said:
 
 'It need hardly be emphasized that the acceptance by the Court of the principle recognizing the taking into account of an admission of liability, and the saving of time and expense involved in it, does not imply any doctrine that would increase a penalty because there was no admission. The law does not permit that. The contravener who fights the case to the bitter end will obtain no discount, but the penalty imposed will be the proper penalty, and no more. However, the penalties I have ordered to be paid here do not represent what I would have imposed as proper in such circumstances, since I have made substantial allowance for the admissions, both as indicative of a true resolve to comply with the law in future, and as involving a benefit to the community, belated though it was, that ought to be recognized in the fixing of penalties that are just in all the circumstances.' 


In Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236, the ACCC contended on appeal that the trial judge had erred by concluding that the respondents should be given credit for their meaningful co-operation in the investigation of the ACCC and in the conduct of the hearing. On that occasion, the ACCC submitted that there was no support in the authorities, or in principle, for a penalty to be reduced on account of the way in which litigation is conducted where liability is in issue. The Full Court accepted the ACCC's submission and concluded that the conduct of the trial should not have been taken into account in fixing penalty, although it is something to which regard might have been had in relation to costs orders: at 285 [166].</text>

29 The same observation can be made concerning Advance Bank , upon which the CEPU relied. In that case, Gummow J was required to assess penalties in relation to five misleading advertisements published over a two week period. His Honour referred with approval to the following remarks by Lockhart J in Trade Practices Commission v Bata Shoe Company of Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) (1980) 44 FLR 149 at 176:
 
 'Guidance is given in the field of sentencing for criminal offences by the well-known principle that where several offences are heard together and arise out of the same transaction it is a sound working rule that the sentences imposed for those offences should be made concurrent; it is inappropriate to sentence consecutively when the offences were all really involved in the same episode... 
 
 I accept that the contraventions arose out of the one course or pattern of conduct. Although it is necessary to look at each contravention separately, nevertheless consideration must be given to the facts common to each contravention.'

42 If the CEPU's conduct that is relevant to Edison's contravention of s 45EA can be distinguished from its conduct in relation to the s 45E(3) contravention, with the consequence that s 76(3) does not apply, I consider that the approach described in Allied Mills , Advance Bank and in McPhee at 584 [185] should be applied in the circumstances of this case. In substance, the CEPU engaged in a single course of conduct that was related and interlocking and which involved it in both contraventions. To my mind, it would be artificial to distinguish between the conduct that is relevant to the making of the arrangement and that which is relevant to Edison's giving effect to the arrangement. The CEPU's conduct in relation to the two contraventions is so interconnected that the appropriate course is to apply the totality principle to set a penalty for the CEPU's accessorial conduct in respect of one breach and to take the CEPU's involvement in the other breach into account. Adopting that approach, I have concluded that the appropriate penalty would not differ from that which I would impose on the basis that s 76(3) applies.</text>

51 I have already observed that the CEPU was aware that DJN performed work at Loy Yang B, that it did not have an EBA with the CEPU, and that the provision proposed by the CEPU for Edison's agreement would operate to exclude DJN from working at Loy Yang B so long as it did not enter into an EBA with the CEPU. Edison was also aware of these matters. As events transpired, DJN was the only electrical contractor affected by the arrangement over the period between August 2001 and December 2003. However, the impact of the arrangement was potentially wider than this. In my opinion, it is appropriate to have regard to the fact that the arrangement was general in terms, and that the exclusionary provision had the potential to prevent any electrical contractor being retained by Edison to perform work at Loy Yang B if the contractor did not obtain or maintain a current certified agreement with the CEPU. In Rural Press at 43,296 [46], Mansfield J pointed out that even in cases where the contravening conduct was not carried through to its conclusion and therefore no loss resulted, courts have taken into account the potential harm in determining the seriousness of the offence; see also George Weston and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cromford Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-618.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256</tocase>
<text>28 In Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256 ( 'Allied Mills' ) at 258, Sheppard J was required to assess penalties in relation to price fixing contraventions of s 45 of the TPA. His Honour said that where more than one breach of s 45 is alleged and admitted, it would not be appropriate to impose substantive penalties for each breach because each arises out of the one transaction, namely, the arrangement or understanding alleged in the amended statement of claim. In taking this course, Sheppard J followed the approach adopted by Kitto J in imposing penalties for breaches of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in L Vogel &amp; Son Pty Ltd v Anderson (Minister for Customs) [1967] HCA 46 ; (1968) 120 CLR 157 at 164-165. Sheppard J's approach was followed in TNT at 40,169. These cases involved applications of the totality principle rather than s 76(3).

32 The Full Court added at 584 [185] that, if s 76(3) did not apply, the totality principle should have been applied because of the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the two contraventions: 
 
 'If it could be said that the conduct relevant to the two contraventions was not the same conduct for the purpose of s 76(3) , we would be of the opinion that his Honour's discretion in calculating the appropriate penalty to be imposed miscarried, in that his Honour failed to have regard to the interlocking nature of the conduct involved in the two contraventions and to the need to set a total penalty appropriate in the circumstances. On the particular facts of this case, it was not appropriate to impose a substantive penalty for each breach of the Act arising as they did out of the one transaction. The appropriate course was to set a penalty for the conduct imposed in respect of one breach and to take the other breach into account: Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (1981) 37 ALR 256; 60 FLR 1 per Sheppard J at FLR 40; Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd , above, at 40,169; McDonald v R (1994) 48 FCR 555; 120 ALR 629. For the reasons we have set out above, we consider that the appropriate total of penalty would have been a sum of $500,000.' 


The penalty of $500,000 was the same figure that the Full Court considered to be the appropriate penalty on the footing that s 76(3) did apply.

42 If the CEPU's conduct that is relevant to Edison's contravention of s 45EA can be distinguished from its conduct in relation to the s 45E(3) contravention, with the consequence that s 76(3) does not apply, I consider that the approach described in Allied Mills , Advance Bank and in McPhee at 584 [185] should be applied in the circumstances of this case.

His Honour referred with approval to the following remarks by Lockhart J in Trade Practices Commission v Bata Shoe Company of Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) (1980) 44 FLR 149 at 176:
 
 'Guidance is given in the field of sentencing for criminal offences by the well-known principle that where several offences are heard together and arise out of the same transaction it is a sound working rule that the sentences imposed for those offences should be made concurrent; it is inappropriate to sentence consecutively when the offences were all really involved in the same episode... 
 
 I accept that the contraventions arose out of the one course or pattern of conduct. Although it is necessary to look at each contravention separately, nevertheless consideration must be given to the facts common to each contravention.'</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Simpson Pope Ltd (1980) 30 ALR 544</tocase>
<text>31 In McPhee at 583 [181]-[183], the Full Court considered the imposition of penalties for making and giving effect to an arrangement or understanding in contravention of s 45. The Court concluded that s 76(3) applied because the conduct which constituted the second contravention of giving effect to the arrangement was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention of making the arrangement: 
 
 'The case presented to his Honour did not distinguish the conduct of McPhee involving the formation of the proscribed arrangement or understanding from the conduct of McPhee said to constitute giving effect to such arrangement or understanding. According to the Commission's case, the delivery by Mr Webb to Mr Jolly of McPhee's rates was an integral part of the conduct that constituted the contravention of s 45 in making, or arriving at, an understanding or arrangement. That same act was also relied upon by the Commission as the act which constituted the further contravention by McPhee of giving effect to the arrangement or understanding. 
 
 If the disclosure by McPhee to DFE of the rates charged by McPhee to ACI Florapak could be said to be an act giving effect to an arrangement or understanding already made or arrived at, it was not conduct distinguishable from the conduct of McPhee which constituted the making of such an arrangement or understanding. Pursuant to s 76(3) of the Act, if conduct constitutes a contravention of two or more provisions of Pt IV , a proceeding may be instituted in respect of each contravention but a person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty in respect of the same conduct. This was not a case involving repeated conduct concerning discrete events occurring at different times and involving disparate parties: Trade Practices Commission v Simpson Pope Ltd (1980) 30 ALR 544; 47 FLR 334 at 336 per Franki J. 
 
 We therefore accept the submission that his Honour erred in imposing separate penalties in respect of the ACI Florapak conduct. The conduct which constituted the second contravention was part and parcel of the conduct which constituted the first contravention and s 76(3) prescribed that only one penalty could be imposed.'

40 This is not a case where different actions were taken by the CEPU at different times and in relation to dealings with different persons or entities. In such a case, the most that could be said was that the conduct on each occasion was of a similar character: see Trade Practices Commission v Simpson Pope Ltd (1980) 30 ALR 544 at 548 per Franki J. On the findings I have made, the CEPU's conduct was part and parcel of one transaction or episode that took place over the period between 9 August and 23 August 2001.

41 In my opinion, the conduct on the part of the CEPU that made it an accessory to Edison's contravention of s 45E(3) is the same conduct that made it an accessory to Edison's contravention of s 45EA. Accordingly, s 76(3) applies. The consequence is that the CEPU is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under s 76(1) in respect of its conduct, and the maximum amount of that penalty is $750,000.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cromford Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-618</tocase>
<text>51 I have already observed that the CEPU was aware that DJN performed work at Loy Yang B, that it did not have an EBA with the CEPU, and that the provision proposed by the CEPU for Edison's agreement would operate to exclude DJN from working at Loy Yang B so long as it did not enter into an EBA with the CEPU. Edison was also aware of these matters. As events transpired, DJN was the only electrical contractor affected by the arrangement over the period between August 2001 and December 2003. However, the impact of the arrangement was potentially wider than this. In my opinion, it is appropriate to have regard to the fact that the arrangement was general in terms, and that the exclusionary provision had the potential to prevent any electrical contractor being retained by Edison to perform work at Loy Yang B if the contractor did not obtain or maintain a current certified agreement with the CEPU. In Rural Press at 43,296 [46], Mansfield J pointed out that even in cases where the contravening conduct was not carried through to its conclusion and therefore no loss resulted, courts have taken into account the potential harm in determining the seriousness of the offence; see also George Weston and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cromford Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-618.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2004) ATPR 42-002</tocase>
<text>57 Prior to August 2001, there was no finding that the CEPU had contravened, or been involved in any contravention, of the TPA. Arising out of events that took place in October 2002, the ACCC instituted proceedings against the CEPU and other unions alleging a contravention of Pt IV of the TPA and which resulted in consent orders: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2004) ATPR 42-002 ( 'PKIU' ). The proceedings related to a picket that was established between 2 October and 23 October 2002 at premises in East Gippsland. The CEPU was the third respondent to the proceedings. Under the consent orders, the CEPU submitted to an injunction by consent, agreed to pay a pecuniary penalty of $100,000, and agreed to implement a trade practices compliance program.

58 Aside from this proceeding and the PKIU case, there is no evidence of any other finding that the CEPU has been involved in contraventions of the TPA either before or after August 2001.

59 The trade practices compliance program which the CEPU implemented in 2004 in accordance with the consent orders made in PKIU is ongoing. It includes the preparation of a compliance procedure document outlining the CEPU's obligations under the TPA and the conduct of regular trade practices seminars for all CEPU officers throughout Australia. On the evidence before the Court, there is no reason to doubt the rigour or ambit of the compliance program. The implementation of the compliance program has been audited and reviewed each year since 2004 and a copy of each audit report was provided to the ACCC. The ACCC has not raised any concerns about its content or reach.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993</tocase>
<text>61 It is a well accepted principle that, in the assessment of a penalty, a respondent who withdraws defences and acknowledges liability, and thereby saves the community the costs of a lengthy trial, is entitled to special consideration in reduction of the penalty that would otherwise be assessed: NW Frozen Foods at 293-294 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; TNT at 40,169 40,170 per Burchett J; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993 at 48,626 48,630 [49]-[71] per Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ. The extent of the discount will depend, inter alia, upon whether the respondent's co-operation with the ACCC indicates a resolve to comply with the law, thereby reducing the need for specific deterrence: see Leahy (No 3) at 309-310 [40]-[41] per Goldberg J.</text>

<tocase>Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/213.html</AustLII>
<text>64 The ACCC's submission is unacceptable as a matter of general principle and runs counter to settled authority in this Court. In TNT at 40,170, Burchett J said:
 
 'It need hardly be emphasized that the acceptance by the Court of the principle recognizing the taking into account of an admission of liability, and the saving of time and expense involved in it, does not imply any doctrine that would increase a penalty because there was no admission. The law does not permit that. The contravener who fights the case to the bitter end will obtain no discount, but the penalty imposed will be the proper penalty, and no more. However, the penalties I have ordered to be paid here do not represent what I would have imposed as proper in such circumstances, since I have made substantial allowance for the admissions, both as indicative of a true resolve to comply with the law in future, and as involving a benefit to the community, belated though it was, that ought to be recognized in the fixing of penalties that are just in all the circumstances.' 


In Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236, the ACCC contended on appeal that the trial judge had erred by concluding that the respondents should be given credit for their meaningful co-operation in the investigation of the ACCC and in the conduct of the hearing. On that occasion, the ACCC submitted that there was no support in the authorities, or in principle, for a penalty to be reduced on account of the way in which litigation is conducted where liability is in issue. The Full Court accepted the ACCC's submission and concluded that the conduct of the trial should not have been taken into account in fixing penalty, although it is something to which regard might have been had in relation to costs orders: at 285 [166].</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard [2005] FCA 1037 ; (2005) 145 FCR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1037.html</AustLII>
<text>72 The ACCC submitted that an important consideration in the context of deterrence is that the CEPU has expressed no contrition for its involvement in Edison's contraventions of ss 45E(3) and 45EA. As a result, the ACCC submitted that the Court could have no confidence that the CEPU and its senior officers, including Mighell, regret what happened or that they have resolved to ensure that contravening conduct of the kind in question in this case will not happen again. An explicit statement of contrition will ordinarily be associated with an admission of liability: see eg, Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard [2005] FCA 1037 ; (2005) 145 FCR 57 at 64 [31] . Where a respondent contests allegations that it contravened a provision of Pt IV of the TPA, and wishes to preserve its right of appeal, it is hardly to be expected that the respondent will express unreserved contrition at the penalty hearing. Moreover, there may be reasons unknown to the court why a respondent has not been prepared to admit liability prior to the hearing. In general, I consider that an appropriate expression of contrition may warrant a discount on penalty, but the absence of an expression of that kind ought not to elevate the penalty beyond what would otherwise be appropriate. In this context, the inquiry that must be pursued is what level of penalty is required to achieve the objective of specific deterrence, having regard to the factors to which the CEPU points, including its record of non-contravention since October 2002 and its ongoing compliance program, and the other circumstances of the case. I have concluded that the absence of an expression of contrition by the CEPU for its contraventions should not elevate the penalty to be imposed on the CEPU beyond what would otherwise be appropriate.

73 The CEPU referred the Court to three cases in which penalties were imposed on unions under the TPA. It contended that these cases supported its submission that the appropriate penalty was in the order of $20,000, and that the penalty proposed by the ACCC was excessive.

74 In the PKIU case, the Court held that three unions, including the CEPU, contravened s 45D of the TPA by forming and maintaining a picket line over the period from 2 October 2002 to 23 October 2002 which prevented the construction of a gas plant. Each of the unions agreed to a penalty of $100,000, in circumstances where there was no order for costs against them. The picket line was established in defiance of orders made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('the Commission') and caused significant losses to the owner of the plant. In his reasons for judgment, Gray J noted that the respondents had reached agreement to pay compensation to the plant owner for its losses, that the respondents were entitled to credit for their co-operation with the Commission and for the saving of public money in relation to the litigation, and that it was not suggested that any of the respondents had a record of similar contraventions: at 48,750 [8]. On the other side of the ledger, Gray J noted several factors that would tend to increase the size of the penalty: the picket continued to be operated despite the orders of the Commission, the delay in the construction of the plant was thus extended, and the unions had not instituted any program or training designed to ensure compliance with the TPA: at 48,751 [10]. His Honour concluded that the penalties ought to be at the very highest end of the range appropriate for conduct of the kind in question, and on that basis he made orders which imposed penalties at the agreed level of $100,000. In the absence of agreement as to that level of penalty, Gray J said that he would have fixed a figure considerably lower than $100,000. In expressing this view, Gray J took particular note of the fact that the unions were not profit-making enterprises and did not engage in the conduct in question for their own gain. His Honour also noted that the agreed penalties represented a large sum for the unions to pay from their own resources which would ultimately have to come from the pockets of wage earners.</text>

<text>75 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; (2001) 114 FCR 472, the offending conduct comprised two picket lines which delayed the departure of two vessels. The parties agreed upon a penalty of $75,000 for each of the contraventions of s 45DB of the TPA. Hill J found that these penalties were appropriate, although he considered them to be at the bottom of the range, bearing in mind that the conduct was deliberate and involved the implementation of a policy which was most likely to contravene the TPA: at 493 [97]. Hill J also said that, in accepting the agreed penalties of $75,000 for each contravention, he had taken into account the fact that the respondents had co-operated with the ACCC to agree the facts and had accepted that their conduct amounted to a contravention, thereby reducing the expense which a contested hearing would have required: at 493 [97].</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1730.html</AustLII>
<text>76 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 , two unions were involved in conduct on two separate occasions, in April 2004 and again in November 2004, in contravention of s 45D of the TPA. The April conduct interrupted a concrete pour for several hours and it was followed by a picket which obstructed access to a construction site for a new hotel at the Burswood Casino in Perth. The interruption of a concrete pour and the picket caused significant delays to the project and exposed the builder to losses. The November conduct was another picket at the site which restricted access by construction workers. Each of the unions agreed to pay a pecuniary penalty to the Commonwealth of $50,000. Nicholson J concluded that the proposed penalties were appropriate. In doing so, his Honour made particular reference to the fact that the unions had co-operated with the ACCC by approaching the Court for the final disposition of the proceeding on a non-contested basis, and that neither union had engaged in the conduct for financial gain: at [14].

77 The facts of these cases are very different from the facts of the case before me. Each case involved an agreement as to the appropriate level of penalty. I accept that the conduct involved in each case had significant adverse commercial or financial consequences, more so than in the case before me, although I note that in the PKIU case the unions agreed to pay compensation to the affected company. In the end, while these three cases provide general guidance, I have derived limited assistance from them because each case turned on its particular facts.

78 Weighing up all of the factors to which I have referred, I consider that the penalty of $20,000 proposed by the CEPU does not properly reflect the nature and seriousness of the contravening conduct. It is, moreover, inadequate from the viewpoint of both specific and general deterrence. On the other hand, I consider that the penalty proposed by the ACCC is disproportionate to the size and financial resources of the CEPU and the nature, seriousness, duration and impact of the contravening conduct.</text>
