<text>Further, I note that the original respondent to this appeal is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Following the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) HCA 24 , I order that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as second respondent to these proceedings.

No specific Refugees Convention claims were made by or on behalf of the appellant wife who relied on membership of the appellant husband's family unit. In the protection visa application and before the Tribunal the appellant husband claimed a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of religion and political opinion. He claimed that he was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ('BJP'), that he supported victims of the Gujarat train massacre and due to such support was persecuted by Muslim political parties and extremist Muslims. The appellant husband claimed to have suffered property damage, to have been attacked resulting in hospitalisation and to have received threats.

On 23 December 2003 the Tribunal invited the appellants to a hearing and on 13 February 2004 the Tribunal was advised in writing that the appellants did not wish to attend. The appellants did not attend the hearing and the Tribunal proceeded to determine the matter on the evidence available to it in their absence as permitted by s 426A Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</text>
