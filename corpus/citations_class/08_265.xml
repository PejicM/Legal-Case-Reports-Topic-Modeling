<text>61 In short, attachment 2 was not prepared by a legal practitioner and there is no relevant legal context. Accordingly, it does not attract client legal privilege or litigation privilege: see AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2005) 152 FCR 382 at [144] - [145] .</text>

<text>71 In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 , a Full Court, after referring to Mann v Carnell and other authorities said at [52]:
 
 [52] These authorities show that, where issue or implied waiver is made out, the privilege holder has expressly or impliedly made an assertion about the contents of an otherwise privileged communication for the purpose of mounting a case or substantiating a defence. Where the privilege holder has put the contents of the otherwise privileged communication in issue, such an act can be regarded as inconsistent with the confidentiality that would otherwise pertain to the communication.</text>

<tocase>DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; (2003) 127 FCR 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/384.html</AustLII>
<text>72 Their Honours referred with approval to the statement of Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; (2003) 127 FCR 499 at [58] . His Honour there referred to waiver coming about when a party entitled to the privilege makes an assertion which is either about the contents of the confidential communication or which necessarily lays it open to scrutiny. Privilege is lost because an inconsistency arises between the act and the maintenance of the confidence, informed partly by forensic unfairness.

73 It is true that Mr Pearson has deployed the existence of the separate settlement team and the fact that the team developed a proposed settlement regime for consideration by the Enforcement Committee. However, I do not consider that the assertions in Mr Pearson's affidavit at [8] and [10] [15] fall within the principles referred to above.

74 In particular, I do not consider that the assertions in the affidavit are about the contents of the redacted portions of attachment 1.</text>

<tocase>Hudson v Branir Pty Limited (2005) 148 NTR 1 </tocase>
<text>17 The parties agreed that I should follow the course adopted in Hudson v Branir Pty Limited (2005) 148 NTR 1 by having regard to the context of evidence proposed to be adduced at the final hearing so as to be able to determine the context in which the dispute over the Notice to Produce arises. Some of that material, though not yet formally in evidence, was read out and referred to in open Court and I will refer to the salient parts in my reasons for judgment.

18 Mr Mark Pearson is the Executive General Manager of the Enforcement and Compliance Division of the ACCC. At all times since about July 2006, Mr Pearson has been the most senior staff member of the ACCC with overall responsibility for the investigation of air cargo price fixing.

19 Mr Paul Taylor, Director, Coordination Branch, has been responsible for conducting the investigation on a day-to-day basis since about July 2006.</text>

<tocase>Kotan Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1991) 30 FCR 511</tocase>
<text>13 The ACCC contends that there is no legitimate forensic purpose to support the production of these documents. The essential reason for this is that the ACCC submits that the only relevant decision in relation to the attack upon the s 155 notice is the decision of the ACCC itself; decisions of officers or staff cannot be decisions of the ACCC to issue the notice. The ACCC relies upon a decision of a Full Court in Kotan Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1991) 30 FCR 511.

14 The ACCC also contends that even if there is a legitimate forensic purpose in the production of the documents, certain redacted portions of them are subject to a claim for legal professional privilege. One portion is also said, in the alternative, to be the subject of a claim for public interest immunity.

38 Kotan , on which counsel for the ACCC relied, was an appeal from an order of a single judge striking out a statement of claim seeking relief against s 155 notices issued by the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission.

39 Crucial to the decision of the Court, and to the ACCC's argument in the present case, were the terms of [16] of the statement of claim. It pleaded that on a date unknown to the applicants: (i) the Commission; (ii) the officers of the Commission having the conduct of the matter; (iii) the solicitor acting for the Commission; had decided that proceedings should be instituted.

40 Davies and Foster JJ said at 516 that they accepted that it may be arguable that the power to issue a s 155 Notice ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be instituted. However, they said that this was not pleaded in [16] of the statement of claim. Lockhart J observed at 522 that the only relevant decision could be that of the Commission itself, so that the allegations that officers of the Commission and the solicitor had decided to institute proceedings could not stand.

41 These were statements of a Full Court and, of course, I accept them as binding, authoritative and correct. But they were made in relation to the pleading that was in issue before their Honours. In my view, their Honours' remarks on this topic, though no doubt central to the question at the final hearing, do not assist the ACCC on the question of the Notice to Produce.

42 What [8] of KAL's statement of issues leaves open for determination on the final hearing, is who, in the present case, comprised the Commission. In this respect, [8] of the statement is in different terms from [16] of the statement of claim in Kotan where the pleading specifically referred to persons who could not have constituted the Commission for the purpose of the decision to issue the s 155 notice.

45 This approach is consistent with that which was adopted by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Limited [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389 at [37] [38]. His Honour accepted that the effect of the decision by the judges in Kotan is that the question of whether the exercise of the power is for an improper purpose is to be determined by a consideration of all the circumstances.

46 The precise limits of the power to issue a s 155 notice were left open in Kotan. Davies and Foster JJ accepted that it was arguable that the power ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be instituted (at 516). Lockhart J at 521 was of the view that the Commission's power to issue a s 155 notice does not cease and is not abused merely because the Commission has made a decision to commence proceedings.

47 The documents required by [5] of the Notice to Produce are documents created by senior officers of the ACCC. They go to the questions raised in [8] of the Statement of Issues and to the questions of purpose raised by the other paragraphs set out above.

48 I reject the submission that they lack a legitimate forensic purpose.</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>15 KAL contends that even if the relevant portions of the document are properly the subject of the claim for legal professional privilege, that privilege has been waived in accordance with the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1.

16 The evidence before me on the hearing was an affidavit of Mr Scott Gregson, the General Manager of the Enforcement Branch of the ACCC. His affidavit deals with the claims of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity.

70 The principle of implied waiver, under which a party who would otherwise be entitled to the benefit of legal professional privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [29].

71 In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 , a Full Court, after referring to Mann v Carnell and other authorities said at [52]:
 
 [52] These authorities show that, where issue or implied waiver is made out, the privilege holder has expressly or impliedly made an assertion about the contents of an otherwise privileged communication for the purpose of mounting a case or substantiating a defence. Where the privilege holder has put the contents of the otherwise privileged communication in issue, such an act can be regarded as inconsistent with the confidentiality that would otherwise pertain to the communication.</text>

<tocase>Workcover Authority (NSW) v Law Society of New South Wales (2006) 65 NSWLR 502</tocase>
<text>54 The principles applicable to legal professional privilege as a rule of substantive law were comprehensively reviewed by McColl JA in Workcover Authority (NSW) v Law Society of New South Wales (2006) 65 NSWLR 502 at [72]ff.

55 The following relevant propositions emerge from her Honour's review of English and Australian authority:
 
&#8226; Once it is established that a legal practitioner was acting in the requisite capacity, a confidential communication will attract privilege even if it contains extraneous matter, as long as it was prepared for the dominant purpose of giving legal advice.
 
&#8226; Legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it may include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context.
 
&#8226; What matters is whether the lawyers are being asked qua lawyers to provide legal advice.
 
&#8226; The presence of other matter may raise a question of the purpose for which the document was brought into existence but this will be a question of fact.
 
&#8226; The privilege should not be undermined by an overly narrow or technical approach to the identification of the relevant advice.</text>

<tocase>Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 </tocase>
<text>58 It is well-established that the Court may inspect the documents in question to ascertain whether any doubts about the validity of the claim are made good by an inspection of the documents: see eg Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 at 61.

59 The parties agreed that I may inspect the documents. I have done so and am satisfied that the claim for the redacted portion of attachment 1 is supported.

60 In my view, the claim for legal professional privilege for attachment 2 is not supported, either by the principles to which I have referred or by an inspection of the document.

62 The principles of public interest immunity to be gleaned from the decisions of the High Court in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 and Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85 ; (1984) 154 CLR 404 , were set out by Lockhart J in Zarro at 44-46.</text>
