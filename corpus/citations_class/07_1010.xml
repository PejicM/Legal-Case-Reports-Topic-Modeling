<tocase>Air Services Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/886.html</AustLII>
<text>42 Order 15A is premised upon the proposition that the discovery sought, whether it be identity discovery under r 3 or discovery to enable the applicant to decide whether it has the right to obtain relief, relates to the prospective invocation of the jurisdiction of the Court in a claim for relief against an identified or yet to be identified respondent. Finn J put it thus in Air Services Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 (at 208): 
 
 
 27. Ordinarily a court's jurisdiction is enlivened by an initiating process seeking a determination of the substantive claim one party alleges it has against another. But ... such need not necessarily be the case. Necessity may require otherwise if a person's right is to be vindicated in a substantive claim. Preliminary discovery of the types provided in O 15A rr 3 and 6 have long been accepted as a proper and appropriate precursor to the making of a substantive claim and appropriate because it assists in the administration of justice in relation to the making of the claim itself. There is no reason for present purposes to distinguish between the two types of discovery. Each reflects a different necessity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 28. Though in form a discrete proceeding (as was the old bill of discovery: see the quotation from Story ) preliminary discovery is, as a matter of substance, properly to be regarded as interlocutory in character in that it does not, nor is it intended to, determine finally the rights inter se of the parties to the substantive application: cf Malouf v Malouf [(1999) [1999] FCA 284 ; 86 FCR 134]. Its function rather is to assist in that determination when or if the substantive application is brought consequent upon what is revealed in the preliminary discovery itself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 29. In consequence I consider an O 15A order for preliminary discovery to be an unexceptionable exercise of judicial power when made in relation to the matter necessitating the making of the order.</text>

<tocase>Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper [1999] FCA 169 ; (1999) 92 FCR 90</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/169.html</AustLII>
<text>43 Tamberlin J, like Finn J, had been confronted with a challenge to the validity of O 15A in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper [1999] FCA 169 ; (1999) 92 FCR 90. He held that the rule did not purport to confer jurisdiction on the Court. Rather it was "... an exercise of the rule making power by the judges in accordance with s 59 of the Federal Court Act ". And further (at 99 [46]): 
 
 The Court has the necessary jurisdiction because, at the time when preliminary discovery is sought in the present case, there is a matter in existence and the grant of preliminary discovery is an exercise of power with respect to that matter. 

 
The Full Court dismissed an appeal against the decision of Tamberlin J in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 167 ALR 358.</text>

<tocase>Re Sherlock (1991) 102 ALR 156</tocase>
<text>50 There is no authority to which I have been taken or which I have been able to find directly on the point whether an application for preliminary discovery is an originating process in a proceeding. There is analogous authority in relation to like processes. In Re Sherlock (1991) 102 ALR 156 Lockhart J held that an application for orders that persons be directed to attend before the Court for examination under the provisions of the Corporations Law was not an originating process. In this his Honour followed Re Austral Oil Estates Ltd (in liq) (1986) 86 FLR 247 at 248, a decision of McLelland J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to an examination order under s 541 of the Companies (NSW) Code which was the predecessor of s 597 of the Corporations Law. In neither of those judgments was there any elaboration of the characterisation of an application for examination as falling outside the concept of "originating process".

51 In Fiorentino v Irons (1997) 79 FCR 327, Foster J declined to follow what he characterised as the obiter observations of Lockhart J in Re Sherlock 102 ALR 156. He noted that the decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court turned upon the precise meaning of the Supreme Court Rules . He made the point that they were not framed in the same way as the Federal Court Rules were at that time. In particular, there was then no definition of "originating process" in either the Federal Court Rules or the Federal Court Act. His Honour relied upon the definition of "proceeding" in the Act. He said it was a very wide definition and he was satisfied that the issue of summons for examination was a proceeding. As to the width of the term "proceeding" his Honour referred to Re Interchase Corporation Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 481 at 487 (Kiefel J) and Pasdale Pty Ltd v Concrete Constructions (1995) 59 FCR 446 at 448 (Finn J). In the latter case Finn J said: 
 
 The definition of 'proceeding' in the Federal Court of Australia Act s 3 [sic], for example, in its reference to 'an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding', is apt to encompass a motion for security for costs.</text>

52 More recently in Re Strarch International Ltd (in liq) [2005] FCA 829 , Jacobson J held that an examination summons under s 596A of the Corporations Act 2001 was "originating process" within O 8 r 1. It may be noted that at the time his Honour made that decision O 8 r 1 did not define originating process but simply listed the kinds of proceedings in which originating process could be served on a person outside Australia. His Honour followed the reasoning of Foster J in Fiorentino 79 FCR 327 that the different approach which applied in the Supreme Court of New South Wales turned upon the different wording of the rules of that court. He granted leave to the liquidator of the relevant company in that case to serve examination summonses outside the Commonwealth in Malaysia on four named former directors of the company.</text>
