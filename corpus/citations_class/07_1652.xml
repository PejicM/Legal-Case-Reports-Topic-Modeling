<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/14.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The Tribunal accepted the appellant's claims but found on the basis of independent country information, and the appellant's own evidence, that his fears of further harm amounting to persecution for reason of his race in Indonesia were not well founded. The Tribunal's findings were open for the reasons it provided. The choice and interpretation of country information is a factual matter for the Tribunal alone: NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [11] - [13] ; Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 29 ; (2005) 216 ALR 1 at [8] per Gleeson CJ; NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [81] , [84]. The Court cannot review the merits of the Tribunal's decision: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272, and there is no error of law in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>22 As regards to the first ground, the Federal Magistrate correctly noted that country information falls within s 424A(3)(a) of the Act: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 at [64] - [74] , [112]-[138]; WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330 at [44] - [46] ; QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92 at [7] - [30] ; VJAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178 at [11] - [16] . His Honour also correctly noted that procedural fairness did not apply to the Tribunal because of s 422B of the Act: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214 at [66] ; SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 at [7] - [8] ; NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [85] . Finally, his Honour noted that the Tribunal had referred to the same country information as was in the delegate's decision, so there could be no breach of procedural fairness in any event. For these reasons, his Honour correctly rejected the first ground.</text>
