<tocase>Aldridge v Booth [1988] FCA 170 ; (1988) 80 ALR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1988/170.html</AustLII>
<text>In my view, the conduct of Mr Flynn constituted by the May 2005 allegations amounted to sexual harassment. He clearly made a request for sexual favours to Ms Poniatowska by his emails of 8 May 2005 and 10 May 2005 and by his subsequent SMS text messages. Those requests were unwelcome on the part of Ms Poniatowska: see Aldridge v Booth [1988] FCA 170 ; (1988) 80 ALR 1. It is not necessary to find whether the email of 8 May 2005 was made in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that Ms Poniatowska would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by it. That is because, in the light of her response to the first email, I find that the subsequent communications referred to, starting with the email of 10 May 2005, were made in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances including the terms of Ms Poniatowska's response, would have anticipated that she would be offended and humiliated by them. She had clearly indicated that she did not wish to receive requests for sexual favours from him. Mr Flynn nevertheless persisted to make such requests in the manner I have found. Having indicated her attitude quite clearly, it was apparent, and a reasonable person would have anticipated, that Ms Poniatowska would be offended if the requests were maintained (as they were). It was also apparent, and a reasonable person would have anticipated, that she would be humiliated by such conduct because it conveys an understanding of the potential preparedness of Ms Poniatowska to have a sexual relationship with him, notwithstanding her clearly expressed attitude to the contrary. Even if Mr Flynn did not see the situation that way, and was nevertheless hopeful of establishing a sexual relationship, that does not result in a different conclusion. The test in s 28A is clearly an objective one: see generally Leslie v Graham [2002] FCA 32 at [70] .</text>

<tocase>McDonald v State of South Australia [2008] SASC 134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/2008/134.html</AustLII>
<text>The cause of action predicates the existence of a duty of mutual trust and confidence, to be implied into Ms Poniatowska's contract of employment. Ms Poniatowska referred to a series of Australian authorities purportedly accepting the existence of such an implied term: McDonald v State of South Australia [2008] SASC 134 ; Delooze v Healey [2007] WASCA 157 ; Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd [2005] HCA 15 ; (2005) 222 CLR 44 ; and Russell v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney [2007] NSWSC 104. Since the hearing, an appeal has been decided in respect of the latter matter: Russell v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney [2008] NSWCA 217.

In a recent decision of Tracey J, Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597 , his Honour noted at [80] that the question of whether such terms may be implied in contracts of employment is one of controversy on which the High Court has yet to make a definitive pronouncement. His Honour reviewed the authorities and made the following observations at [83]-[85]: 
 In this Court single judges have adopted a more guarded approach. In McDonald (at 398-400) Buchanan J reviewed the authorities relating to the mutual trust and confidence term. He expressed disquiet about the notion that such a term could have escaped judicial notice for so long. More significantly he queried whether such a term could be implied consistently with the principles expounded by the High Court in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283. I respectfully share his Honour's reservations. 

 
 In Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1678 ; (2005) 226 ALR 114 at 156-157 Kenny J held that, in Australia, a term of good faith "does not apply to employment contracts". On appeal the Full Court did not need to express a view on her Honour's finding: see Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 101 ; (2006) 233 ALR 687 at 708 [86] . 

 
 As a single judge I would follow the decisions of other single judges unless I considered them to be clearly wrong: see Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. Although Buchanan J's observations in McDonald were obiter I nonetheless consider them to be correct. Kenny J's ruling in Walker forms part of the ratio of her decision in that case. I do not consider either decision to be clearly wrong. Had it been necessary I would have followed them.</text>

 As a single judge I would follow the decisions of other single judges unless I considered them to be clearly wrong: see Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. Although Buchanan J's observations in McDonald were obiter I nonetheless consider them to be correct. Kenny J's ruling in Walker forms part of the ratio of her decision in that case. I do not consider either decision to be clearly wrong. Had it been necessary I would have followed them.

As I have found that ESA discriminated against Ms Poniatowska on the ground of her sex, and contravened s 14(2)(c) of the SD Act by so discriminating against her by dismissing her, I do not need to decide whether, in the circumstances, a term of mutual trust and confidence ought be implied into Ms Poniatowska's employment contract. Such a finding would not add to the range of remedies or the extent of the compensation awarded. In those circumstances, it is appropriate simply to note the observations of Tracey J in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597.

It is now necessary to consider the appropriate award of damages or other relief to be granted to Ms Poniatowska.

In her application, she seeks the giving of an apology or apologies from those respondents against whom adverse findings have been made.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1150.html</AustLII>
<text>There are a number of reasons for that. In the first place, in my view, the adverse findings made against the respondents in respect of the conduct concerning them individually is sufficient recognition for Ms Poniatowska of the inappropriateness of that conduct. The imposition upon those respondents, who variously denied the conduct specifically attributed to them or in some respects denied its significance, would put them in the position of requiring them to apologise for conduct which they did not accept that they had severally engaged in: see for instance the observations of Branson J in Jones v Toben [2002] FCA 1150 ; (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106] ; Jones v The Bible Believers' Church [2007] FCA 55 at [65] .</text>
