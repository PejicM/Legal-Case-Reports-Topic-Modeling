<tocase>Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 104 ALR 621</tocase>
<text>That conclusion requires that the application for leave to appeal from that interlocutory decision should be dismissed. Neither of the limbs in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 104 ALR 621 has been made out in the present case.

In summary, there is not sufficient doubt about the Federal Magistrate's decision to warrant it being reconsidered by the Federal Court. The applicant, apart from evincing her unhappiness that the Federal Magistrate's decision was adverse to her, has not identified any error in that decision. It is plain also that no substantial injustice will result from the refusal of leave.

In those circumstances the application for leave should be dismissed with costs to be taxed, if not agreed.
