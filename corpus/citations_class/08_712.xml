<tocase>SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/163.html</AustLII>
<text>3 This is set out conveniently in [3] to [17] of the decision of the Federal Magistrate whose orders are the subject of the present appeal: SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163. The following is an adaptation of those paragraphs. I should indicate at the outset that the Tribunal has made three decisions in relation to review applications of the appellant. Though it is technically inaccurate, I will for ease in exposition differentiate between what I will call the "first Tribunal", "the second Tribunal" and the "third Tribunal".

4 The Tribunal decision, the subject of the present judicial review proceedings, is in fact the third decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appellant. The first review was conducted in 2000. The appellant was unsuccessful, both before the delegate of the Minister and before the Tribunal at that time and for reasons of lack of credibility in each instance. In the claim advanced by the appellant in 2000 he and his wife used false identities. His claimed entitlement to a protection visa and to refugee status under the Refugee Convention arose from a fear of his being persecuted by Serbs, arising out of what he said was his forced conscription into the Kosovo Liberation Army.

5 Notwithstanding the lack of success of their application, in 2001 the Minister exercised his discretion under s 417(1) of the Act and provided the appellant and his wife with three year protection visas on humanitarian grounds.</text>

<tocase>STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The Tribunal noted that the appellant's brother had succeeded on a similar claim. The appellant's brother's claim had been made prior to the amendment of s 91S of the Act that was effected by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 6) 2001 (Cth) . The effect of these amendments is described in the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556.

14 The Tribunal went on to say:
 Even if I were satisfied which I am not that the applicant's family were involved in such a feud, the applicant's claims amount to a claim to fear persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group, namely his family. In considering such a claim, s 91S of the Migration Act would be relevant and, in interpreting that provision, I would be bound by the terms and reasons of the High Court's decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ... Following that decision and applying s 91S(a) , it is clear that the applicant's cousin, Martin's fear of persecution would be for a reason other than those mentioned in Art 1A(2) of the Convention namely revenge for murder. Section 91S(a) would then require that fear of persecution to be disregarded. Section 91S(b)(i) would then require the applicant's fear of persecution to be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that that fear would not exist if his cousin's fear had never existed. And s 91S(b)(ii) would require that his father's and brother's fear of persecution be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that neither of those fears would exist either if the cousin's fear had never existed. The result of disregarding the fears of persecution of the cousin, the applicant, the father and the brother would then be that the applicant would be treated as not having a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the (sic) his family.

15 It is necessary to refer only to two provisions of the Act, s 91S and s 425. Section 91S provides:
 For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person (the first person), in determining whether the first person has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the first person's family: 
 
 (a) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear or persecution is not a reason mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and 
 
 (b) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that:
 
 (i) the first person has ever experienced; or
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced; 
 
 
 
 
 
 where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution would not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution mentioned in paragraph (a) had never existed.

16 As the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs illustrates, this provision has an inexorable operation to fears of persecution based on family membership in the usual blood feud case.

17 Section 425(1) provides:
 The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>18 
 
As the High Court indicated in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [33] to [35]:
 
 
 [33] The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited "to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review ". The reference to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" is important. 
 
 [34] Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa. The statutory language "arising in relation to the decision under review" is more particular. The issues arising in relation to a decision under review are to be identified having regard not only to the fact that the Tribunal may exercise ... all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the original decision-maker (here, the minister's delegate), but also to the fact that the Tribunal is to review that particular decision, for which the decision-maker will have given reasons.
 
 [35] The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered. The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. But ... unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the Tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant. 
 
 
 
 
 (Emphasis in original.)

19 As I have already noted, the particular decision that was under review by the third Tribunal was the decision of the second delegate who said that he found the appellant was not credible in those claims originally advanced under his false identity and that he made no claims in relation to fear of persecution in Albania under his actual name. To reiterate the Albanian blood feud claims were only raised for the first time before the second Tribunal whose decision was quashed by Brown FM.

20 There has been recent discussion and some level of disagreement between judges of this Court on the operation of s 425(1) where a Tribunal decision is quashed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal (whether or not constituted by the same member) for determination. For present purposes I would merely note the following.</text>

<tocase>SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291</tocase>
<text>21 (i) Until the Tribunal makes a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s 414, it has a duty to perform that particular review: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39].

23 (iii) When a decision on a particular review is set aside, it is a decision of the Tribunal, not of the person constituting it, that is set aside: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at [31] . Correspondingly, a redetermination of the particular review is a redetermination by the Tribunal, not by the particular member who happens to constitute the Tribunal for the purpose: SZEPZ at [38].

24 (iv) As was said by the Full Court in SZEPZ at [39]:
 An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid. The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made. 
To the extent that Cowdroy J is properly to be taken as suggesting to the contrary in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; (2007) 98 ALD 567 at [34] , his Honour's view ought not be followed in my view.

25 (v) As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter, the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s 424A and s 425 in the conduct of that review prior to the making of an invalid decision may, but need not necessarily, be a sufficient discharge of those statutory obligations for the purpose of making a subsequent and valid decision on the review: SZEPZ (on s 424A); SZILQ (on s 425); and also NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413. Thus, a s 424A notice or a s 425 invitation given prior to the Tribunal's invalid decision may, or may not, suffice without a further notice or invitation depending upon whether on the remitter the circumstances then are such that s 424A or s 425 does or does not require, according to their respective terms, a fresh notice or invitation.</text>

<tocase>SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 163 FCR 304</tocase>
<text>22 (ii) An invalid Tribunal decision in purported performance of a particular review is to be treated for all purposes as having no operative effect and it does not represent a performance by the Tribunal of its duty in connection with that review: SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 163 FCR 304 at [10].

25 (v) As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter, the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s 424A and s 425 in the conduct of that review prior to the making of an invalid decision may, but need not necessarily, be a sufficient discharge of those statutory obligations for the purpose of making a subsequent and valid decision on the review: SZEPZ (on s 424A); SZILQ (on s 425); and also NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413. Thus, a s 424A notice or a s 425 invitation given prior to the Tribunal's invalid decision may, or may not, suffice without a further notice or invitation depending upon whether on the remitter the circumstances then are such that s 424A or s 425 does or does not require, according to their respective terms, a fresh notice or invitation.</text>

<text>35 It is now well accepted that, where an application for an administrative decision such as here is one which the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse, irrespective of any question of procedural fairness, then relief may be refused on the ground of utility: see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [57] - [58] ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] .

37 Though the appellant has not addressed, and has not been asked to address, the application of s 91S to his claim, he so founded and formulated it that the section applied inevitably and inexorably as to ordain that that claim "lacked the requisite Convention nexus": SZBYR at [29]. I am, in consequence, satisfied the Federal Magistrate did not err in dismissing the application for judicial review.

38 I will order that the appeal be dismissed with costs.
