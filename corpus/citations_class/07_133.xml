<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/28.html</AustLII>
<text>20 In Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, after adverting to the test of apprehended bias in curial proceedings, said at [28]:
 
 'Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof.'

21 A reading of the transcript does not disclose any statement or conduct that might give rise to a suggestion that might give rise to apprehended bias. There is nothing in the Tribunal's reasons that could lead a reasonable lay observer to apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to the determination of the matter before it.

22 It cannot be said that simply because the Tribunal rejected the appellant's account a fair-minded lay person might think that the Tribunal might not have brought an impartial mind to the hearing. That submission, if accepted, would make decision making impossible.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Section 420 is facultative in that it absolves the Tribunal from some of the constraints imposed on courts of law: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 628, 635, 642-644, 659, and 664-668. Section 420 does not impose a duty upon the Tribunal which, if breached, would involve jurisdictional error.

26 Ground number 5 appears to be a restatement of ground number 3, together with the further complaint that the Tribunal was actually biased. No complaint of that kind was made to the Federal Magistrate. No particulars of the complaint had been made on this appeal.

27 I am unable to discern any fact or circumstance which could lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal was actually biased.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>32 Section 422B provides that Division 4 of Part VII of the Act is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule. To that end, the Tribunal is obliged to comply with Division 4. Section 422B has been recently considered by the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214. In that case, the Court was called upon to construe s 51A which is relevantly in the same terms as s 422B. The Court held that the intention of the legislature was to provide a comprehensive procedural code for procedural fairness and at the same time to exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule, although the bias rule is not excluded. The legislature intended to reverse the result of the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 where the majority held that the then wording of the Act did not exclude the common law rules of natural justice. There is, on the strength of that authority, no obligation on the decision maker to provide procedural fairness except in accordance with s 422B.

33 In this case, there is no suggestion that the Tribunal did not comply with s 422B except insofar as it is complained that the Tribunal did not comply with s 424A.

34 In paragraph 4 of the grounds the appellant asserts that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with s 424A of the Act in that the Tribunal did not provide to the applicant particulars of the information that indicated that forged or fraudulently obtained documents are readily available in Bangladesh.

35 That ground was raised in the application for review by the Magistrate and abandoned before the Magistrate.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/919.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The first contention may be accepted but is itself irrelevant: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27. The relevant application in s 424(3)(b) is the application for review.

50 His contention that he did not provide the July 1996 declaration for the purpose of the application must be rejected. The July 1996 declaration was provided in response to the s 424A letter received from the Tribunal. While the applicant explained that in some respects the July 1996 declaration was not accurate, it was still provided to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application.

51 Ground 6 of the written submissions claims that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in that it ignored relevant material and/or failed to take into account a relevant consideration.</text>
