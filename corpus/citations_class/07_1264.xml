<text>2 The nature of the appellant's claims, the essence of the Tribunal's reasoning and the reasons of the Magistrate are set out in the decision of the court below, which is available on the Internet: SZHHK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FMCA 842. It is not necessary to repeat that material other than to say that the appellant's claim was that he had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his Christianity. He claimed to be the leader of an underground church and that his home had been searched by authorities.

3 Before the Federal Magistrates Court the grounds of review were: first: the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty; and secondly: the Tribunal had bias against the appellant and did not believe that he was a leader of an underground church in China or even a Christian.

4 On the appeal to this Court the appellant's grounds were: first: the Tribunal had bias against him and failed to consider his application according to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth); secondly: the Tribunal failed to consider his application according to s 424A of the Act; thirdly: the Tribunal failed to notify him of the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision; and fourthly: the appellant was not given an opportunity to explain his case.</text>
