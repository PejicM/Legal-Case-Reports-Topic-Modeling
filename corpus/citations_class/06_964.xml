<tocase>Colakovski v Australian Telecommunications Corporation (1991) 29 FCR 429</tocase>
<text>3 The object of the Act, as set out in s 3 , is to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth by making available information and giving access to information about the operations of departments and public authorities, including the ABC. This right is limited by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests (s 3(1)(b) ; Colakovski v Australian Telecommunications Corporation (1991) 29 FCR 429 per Lockhart J at 438). Any discretion conferred by the Act is to be exercised as far as possible so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of information (s 3(2)).

4 Document is defined in s 4(1) and relevantly includes:
 
 '(a) any of, or any part of any of, the following things: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) any paper or other material on which there is writing; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) any article or material from which sounds, images or writings are capable of being reproduced with or without the aid of any other article or device; 
 (v) any article on which information has been stored or recorded, either mechanically or electronically; 
 (vi) any other record of information; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) any copy, reproduction or duplicate of such a thing; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) any part of such a copy, reproduction or duplicate' 
 
 
 
 "Program material" is not defined in the Act.

5 There is no dispute that the materials sought by UTS are "documents" within s 4(1) or that the words "program material" also describe documents within s 4(1). The documents sought are set out in Annexure 1 to these reasons. For the purposes of this appeal the parties have approached the documents as if they constitute a single category. No distinction is drawn by the parties between documents created before broadcasting and documents created after broadcasting. The documents concern complaints about specific ABC programs and the ABC's coverage of the Middle East and fall into two broad categories:
 
 &#8226; correspondence with complainants; and
 &#8226; internal files and correspondence, board minutes, investigation files and reports and documents in relation to the complaints.</text>

<tocase>Fountain v Alexander [1982] HCA 16 ; (1982) 150 CLR 615</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/16.html</AustLII>
<text>6 The ABC did not seek to argue that the documents sought are "program material" per se . Rather, the ABC's submissions support a construction of the expression that would include all documents that relate to program material, including documents created before or after the broadcast of the program and any correspondence about program material. The ABC's submissions are to the effect that the exemption is "in relation to documents in relation to its program material". The ABC then relies on the principle that "in relation to" is an expression of wide and general import ( Fountain v Alexander [1982] HCA 16 ; (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629 per Mason J) and covers all of the documents sought, which are said to exist only because of and arise directly from, the broadcast of ABC program material. The ABC draws a distinction between documents related to its program material, which it says are exempt and documents related to its administrative function, which are outside the scope of the expression.</text>

<text>13 While in some contexts "in respect of" may have a wider meaning than "in relation to" ( Smith v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1987] HCA 48 ; (1987) 164 CLR 513 at 533 per Toohey J; citing Nowegijick v R (1983) 144 DLR (3d) 193 at 200)), in the context of the Schedule "in respect of" has a narrower meaning. That is, "in respect of" is used in the sense of "with reference to" (the Macquarie Dictionary , 4 th ed, 2005 defines "with (or in) respect to" to mean ' in relation to or reference to ', while the Shorter Oxford Dictionary , 5 th ed, 2002 definition includes '[ r ] elation, connection, reference, regard '). A sufficient or material connection or relationship is required when "in respect of" is used, rather than a mere direct or indirect relationship when "in relation to" is used ( Harris v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 226 ; (2002) 125 FCR 46 at [68] [69]). A further restriction on the exemption is thereby introduced for those agencies other than the ABC and SBS.</text>

<tocase>Keane v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Unreported, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 27 May 2004, W93/182 AAT No. 9583)</tocase>
<text>20 UTS ultimately adopted a position that the exemption is only for program material where program material means the recordings and tapes, the "sights and sounds" that are broadcast by television or radio. The difficulty with this position was illustrated when UTS accepted, during the course of submissions, that the following either were, or could be, program material:
 
 &#8226; films or tapes which have or have not been broadcast;
 &#8226; draft tapes and draft films;
 &#8226; material which is ' part of the production process for the film or the tape recording ';
 &#8226; the development proposal and six treatments found to be ' documents relating to program material ' and therefore exempt in the Tribunal's earlier decision in Keane v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at [7] (Unreported, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 27 May 2004, W93/182 AAT No. 9583);
 &#8226; scripts; and
 &#8226; technical directions given by a director for the lighting on a particular program.

21 Both parties rely on the reasoning in Keane which has not been the subject of relevant further comment by a Court or the Tribunal.

22 The Tribunal expressed doubt about the approach in Keane where "program" and "material" were defined separately. It considered "program material" to be a composite term but did not explain what that composite term encompassed. UTS supported that construction. The Tribunal did accept, however, the reasoning in Keane that the Schedule is not limited to program material and held that it encompassed documents relating to program material in that it extended the exemption to ' matters such as the intellectual property of [the ABC] in a program ' (at [32]). No basis for this conclusion was given, nor was an attempt made to explain what criteria were applied. To the extent that this formed part of the reasons of the Tribunal, neither party has supported such a limitation and there is no basis for it. The Tribunal stated that it did not ' see an exemption "in relation to program material" as extending as far as a complaint regarding material in a program and the treatment given to that complaint by [the ABC]' (at [33]) and categorised all of the documents sought in that category.

23 The Tribunal in Keane considered dictionary definitions of "program" and "material". Relevantly, the Macquarie Dictionary defines "program" when used in radio and television as ' a particular item or production '; the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines program(me) when used in broadcasting as '[a] broadcast presentation treated as a single item for scheduling purposes, being broadcast between stated times and without interruption except perhaps for news bulletins or advertisements '.

24 The meaning of "material" in the Macquarie Dictionary encompasses different concepts, including: ' the substance or substances of which a thing is made or composed '; ' any constituent element of a thing '; ' anything serving as crude or raw matter for working upon or developing '; and ' information, ideas, or the like on which a report, thesis, etc, is based '. In the Shorter Oxford Dictionary , it means relevantly '[o] f or pertaining to matter or substance '; '[f] orming the material or substance of a thing ' ; '[ t ] he matter of which a thing is or may be made ' ; and also '[i] nformation, evidence, ideas, etc, for use in writing a book or script, drawing a conclusion, etc '.

25 The Tribunal in Keane found that documents which ' constitute vital steps in the production of a television production program ' and ' make up important elements in that process ' are within the exemption, that is not only is program material exempted but also documents relating to program material (at [7]). It drew a distinction between such documents and a letter which related to a change in script writers which was not exempt.

26 UTS submits that, in effect, the exemption is limited by the meaning of "program material" and that this extends only to the sights and sounds. The ABC made no submission as to the meaning of "program material", other than that it ought not be limited to documents created before a program is broadcast. I do not accept that program material is restricted to films or tapes themselves. In my opinion, it extends at least to the content of the films and tapes. It has not been disputed that the documents sought relate to the content of ABC programs. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to determine the breadth of the application of "program material".

27 UTS sought to rely on extrinsic material to assist in determining the meaning of "program material" and "in relation to program material". The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in its Report on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 and aspects of the Archives Bill 1978 (Parliamentary Paper No 272/1979) ('the Report')) noted that the Bill, expressed to be concerned with freedom of information, refers generally not to information but to documents.</text>

<text>13 While in some contexts "in respect of" may have a wider meaning than "in relation to" ( Smith v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1987] HCA 48 ; (1987) 164 CLR 513 at 533 per Toohey J; citing Nowegijick v R (1983) 144 DLR (3d) 193 at 200)), in the context of the Schedule "in respect of" has a narrower meaning. That is, "in respect of" is used in the sense of "with reference to" (the Macquarie Dictionary , 4 th ed, 2005 defines "with (or in) respect to" to mean ' in relation to or reference to ', while the Shorter Oxford Dictionary , 5 th ed, 2002 definition includes '[ r ] elation, connection, reference, regard ').

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>7 UTS submits that "in relation to" in the context of the Schedule equates to "for" and that the exemption is only for documents which are ABC program material. UTS's submissions support a construction that limits the expression to apply only to the "sights and sounds" of a program: the tapes or recordings. UTS does not submit that the exemption extends only to documents that fall within that aspect of the definition of "document" in s 4(a) that refers to "material", that is s 4(a)(iv). Rather, UTS relies on an amalgamation of the definition of "program" in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (which of course post-dates the Act) and the construction of the expression "Australian content of programs" by Brennan CJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [22] to submit that program material is limited to ' the sights and sounds which are capable of transmission to an audience for the purpose of education or informing or even for advertising or sponsorship '. A script for a program or instructions for the lighting for recording purposes are not, on this basis, included. UTS submits that all of the documents sought are about program material and, not being documents which are program material, do not fall within the exemption. UTS does not dispute the breadth of the expression "in relation to" but submits that, construed in context, the limited meaning of "program material" means that "in relation to" extends only to other versions of the program material itself, such as to edited tapes or recordings.

8 For agencies other than the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation ('SBS') and the ABC, the word "document" is repeated in the Schedule: ' in relation to documents ' in respect of certain activities. For the SBS and the ABC, the entry is ' in relation to its program material '. UTS contends that the class of exempt documents for the ABC and SBS is defined by reference to nature and content and not to an activity. Where the exemption is for documents in respect of an activity, as for other agencies in the Schedule, it extends to documents received or brought into existence in the course of, or for the purposes of, the carrying on of that activity (s 7(4)). By contrast, UTS submits that where the exemption is defined by reference to the nature and content of the particular documents, it should be read as an exemption "for" those particular documents.

9 Section 7(2) provides that the bodies specified in the Schedule are exempt ' in relation to the documents referred to in that [Schedule]'. It follows that the subject matter of the Schedule is documents that come within the definition in s 4(1). The Schedule then limits the documents by category. If there were simply categories of documents listed, such as "scripts for programs", the exemption would be in relation to scripts for programs.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/661.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The parties only referred to one case where the Schedule was discussed ( Rivera v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2005] FCA 661 ; (2005) 144 FCR 334). While Rivera concerned the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), it did refer to the Schedule. The observation of Hill J at [38], that the ABC is exempt under the Act ' in respect of "documents" in relation to its program material ', is consistent with these reasons.</text>

<tocase>Secretary Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell (1992) 36 FCR 367</tocase>
<text>15 UTS points out that the entry in the Schedule for the ABC does not say "documents in respect of its program material". That is correct. Nor does it say "for its program material". The words ' in relation to ' are used. The width of that expression is determined by the context in which it appears and a relevant connection is required with the subject ( Secretary Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell (1992) 36 FCR 367 at 383).

16 Putting together s 7(2) and the Schedule, for agencies other than the ABC and SBS, the exemption is:
 
 'in relation to the documents' (s 7(2)) 'in relation to documents in respect of [the activity] (the Schedule) '. 
 

For the ABC and the SBS, the exemption is:
 
 'in relation to the documents' (s 7(2)) 'in relation to its program material (the Schedule)' .

17 It may well be that the repetition of ' in relation to documents ' was unnecessary for the other agencies, as it was for the ABC. However, the repeated use of "in relation to" reinforces an intention to exempt not only the category of documents specified but also documents that relate to that category. Even if, as submitted by UTS, "in relation to" can mean "for", it is unlikely that it was intended to carry that restricted meaning both in s 7(2) and in the Schedule. It may be that, reading s 7(2) and the Schedule together, the exemption is "for documents in relation to" the category specified but I do not accept that the intention was to exempt only the specified category itself.</text>
