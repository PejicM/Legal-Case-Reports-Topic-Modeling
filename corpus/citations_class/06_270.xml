<text>12 I do not consider that the Tribunal's reasons leading to its finding that the applicant fabricated his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner from mid 2002 disclose jurisdictional error on its part in the way asserted. It was entitled to test the applicant's knowledge of Master Li's teachings, as relevant to that issue. It does not flow from its reasons, either explicitly or implicitly, that it was prescribing a specific level of doctrinal knowledge as a precondition to the applicant (or anyone) being accepted as a Falun Gong practitioner (cf Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1599 ; (2000) 105 FCR 548 at 551-552). I do not therefore need to determine whether such a prescription, especially if based upon the Tribunal's understanding of the particular religion which is not accepted by an applicant or not supported by identified material, might involve jurisdictional error. The applicant did not claim in the course of the hearing that the Tribunal's questions did not relate to Master Li's teachings, and accepted that he did not have a deep level of knowledge of those teachings. His explanation for that was that he had not been practising for a long time.</text>

<text>13 In my view, the Tribunal's finding of fact that the applicant had been untruthful, in particular about his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner since mid 2002 was reached without jurisdictional error. It was based upon the way the applicant responded to the Tribunal's questions on a number of matters, and upon his own evidence as to the nature of what he claimed to have done as a Falun Gong practitioner until mid 2004 and that he had a 'quite superficial' knowledge of Falun Gong. The foundations for its finding of fact were reasonably open to it. No jurisdictional error is demonstrated by the Tribunal making a finding on credibility reasonably available on the material available: Mashayekhi v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 321 ; (2000) 97 FCR 381 at 385.

14 The fact of that fabrication of his early involvement with Falun Gong, together with his limited knowledge of Falun Gong (as the applicant himself acknowledged), then lead the Tribunal not to be satisfied that the applicant's involvement in Falun Gong more recently was otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee. Section 91R(3) of the Act directed the Tribunal, in those circumstances, to disregard the applicant's more recent Falun Gong involvement. It followed that the Tribunal was not satisfied of his grounds for seeking a protection visa. It was therefore required by s 65 to affirm the delegate's decision and to refuse the protection visa sought.

15 The second claim of jurisdictional error was based upon apprehended bias. It was initially argued that the Tribunal must reasonably be apprehended to have pre-judged the applicant's claim by assuming that each follower and believer of the Falun Gong would know and understand that level of doctrinal knowledge which the Tribunal expected. Counsel for the applicant in the course of submissions accepted that the contention limited in that way did not really advance the applicant's claim, as, if he did not succeed on the first ground, he could not succeed on the alternative ground. However, the contention was then developed by during to the course of the hearing.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/30.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In my judgment, the transcript does not indicate circumstances such that a fair-minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not have brought an impartial mind to the consideration of the application: Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 70-71; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425. The Tribunal's role required it to question the applicant, and entitled it to express doubts about aspects of the applicant's evidence or claims and to invite his comments upon those matters: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264 at 269 ( NADH ). The Tribunal went no further than that. It put its concerns to the applicant. It gave him an opportunity to respond. It did not prevent him from responding, or cut off his answers. Its concerns were rational. It does not appear that its manner of questioning was inappropriate.</text>

<tocase>NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264</tocase>
<text>22 In my judgment, the transcript does not indicate circumstances such that a fair-minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not have brought an impartial mind to the consideration of the application: Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 70-71; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425.

The Tribunal went no further than that. It put its concerns to the applicant. It gave him an opportunity to respond. It did not prevent him from responding, or cut off his answers. Its concerns were rational. It does not appear that its manner of questioning was inappropriate.

23 The alternative way the apprehended bias contention was developed is based upon the observations of Allsop J (with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed) in NADH at 284 where his Honour said:
 
 'By and large fact-finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59; 73 ALD 1; [2003] HCA 30. Where fact-finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described, as here, as in substantial respects unreasoned, and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation, at times as plainly and ex facie wrong and as selective of material going one way, these considerations may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might, or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly.' 
 

His Honour went on to ask rhetorically, in relation to the circumstances of that case, how else (the fair-minded observer might ask) can the steps taken by the decision-maker be explained. He then continued:
 
 'The answer to these questions might be that the tribunal lacked an appreciation of the need to weigh all the material. If that were the case it would itself support a conclusion of jurisdictional error. The answer might also be the lack of an ability or willingness to deal with the material before it with a mind open to persuasion fairly evaluating all the material.'</text>

<text>27 I do not consider the Tribunal's questioning of the applicant on his knowledge of the exercises and cultivation of Falun Gong is capable of indicating a closed mind on its part. It had to address his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner since mid 2002. It had reasons to doubt its accuracy, based upon other aspects of the applicant's evidence. Its questions then were directed to testing his knowledge of Falun Gong exercises and practice. It did so using material which it identified, and which the applicant acknowledged he was aware of. Members of the Tribunal in many instances develop a relatively detailed knowledge of the political or religious situation or of the political or religious beliefs of certain groups in many countries. So long as it acts consistently with the requirements of procedural fairness, the Tribunal informs itself as it thinks fit: s 420(2) and Pt 7 Div 4 of the Act; see also SFGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 77 ALD 402 at 408 ( SFGB ). This is not a case where the Tribunal did not disclose the source of its information: cf Collector of Customs, Tasmania v Flinders Island Community Association (1985) 7 FCR 205 at 210-211. Its questioning was not unreasoned or unreasonable. Its conclusions about the applicant's level of knowledge was not shown to be based on selective material, nor to lack a foundation in the material referred to. Indeed the applicant accepted at the conclusion of that sequence of questions that what the Tribunal had put to him was based on what committed practitioners of Falun Gong 'read again and again and again on a daily basis'.

30 If the Tribunal makes a finding which is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion, and there is no evidence to support the finding, there may well be jurisdictional error: SFGB at 407-408, and the cases there cited at [19]-[20]. If the reasons for decision lead to the inference that the Tribunal applied the wrong test, or was not in reality satisfied about the correct text, that too may constitute jurisdictional error: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59. Such an inference might be drawn if there was no information before the Tribunal from which it could realistically or logically draw the conclusions which it did.</text>
