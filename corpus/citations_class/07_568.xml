<text>19 To succeed in its interlocutory claim for relief, Telstra must make out a prima facie case in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is, there is a probability that at the trial in the action Telstra will be held entitled to relief. The balance of convenience must also favour the grant of interlocutory relief sought. These propositions have recently been emphasised by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neil [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457. At this point, the facts need a little more explanation.

20 Premier Media Group is the exclusive licensee of what can be conveniently referred to, as it was by the applicant in its written submissions, as the exclusive licensee of the pay TV slice of the rights in NRL audio-visual footage. Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, a half-owner of Premier Media Group, has the so-called free-to-air slice. The other half-owner of Premier Media Group, News Limited, through its subsidiary, National Rugby League Investments Limited, half owns the NRL, which has been responsible for licensing out these rights. It was submitted by Telstra that in a so-called fully negotiated, high-priced deal, the NRL partnership licensed the new media slice, so-called - that is, internet and telephony - to Telstra in an agreement under which Telstra also became the six-year sponsor of the NRL Partnership's rugby league competition.

21 These facts, in particular, expressed in this way - that is, in a manner taken from the applicant's submissions - were relied upon by the applicant to show that it had paid for a significant grant of a body of rights. That proposition was, in effect, the premise for the applicant's complaint that the grant to it was being derogated from by the respondents and, through them, indirectly, those that controlled the respondents, who also partly controlled those who supplied the grant. In evaluating this submission of derogation from grant, the terms of clause 8.5 of the agreement between the applicant and the two members of the NRL partnership should be borne in mind at all times.</text>

<tocase>British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141</tocase>
<text>33 It is unnecessary to compare minutely the length of time taken in these examples of other media, given the respondents' evidence as to the impugned broadcasts. It may be, and I do not make a finding about this now, that even by these standards, that is the standards of pay television and free to air television, it will be found, that the respondents have, to put it bluntly, been a little greedy in what they have taken for the dealing to be fair as well as newsworthy. Ultimately, that will be a matter of judgment and impression, see British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141 and Hubbard v Vosper [1972] 2 QB 84 and other cases. It is not clear to me that that judgment ought be made, that is, that there has been a taking of too much by reference to the benchmark of free to air and pay television. As I said, it is unnecessary to pursue this judgmental analysis given the way the matter has been argued. My doubts and uncertainties about whether what has been done, goes beyond fair dealing, is strengthened by some evidence concerning the approach of Telstra itself in negotiating with the Australian Football League (the "AFL") in December 2005. Telstra in those negotiations was seeking to reach agreement with that other sporting code about the same kind of rights that it has been able to extract by agreement from the NRL.</text>

<tocase>De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd (1990) 37 FCR 99</tocase>
<text>51 There was a separate and distinct argument that the provision by Fox Sports News to third parties, Hutchison and Vodafone, precludes a fair dealing defence. This was based on the news clippings case, De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd (1990) 37 FCR 99. The applicant, in this connection said that the respondents were simply broking or selling content, not delivering news. That point may be made good on a final hearing; at this point, I am not persuaded that that conduct - that is, the on-passing of the Fox Sports News to the third parties - is not a fair dealing associated with the reporting of news by Vodafone and Hutchison for the purposes of s 103B(1)(b).

52 I turn to the balance of convenience. I am prepared to accept that if I am not to grant interlocutory relief, and if the respondents have overstepped the mark on fair dealing, real and substantial impairment will occur to the applicant's rights. Some evidence was given in a form which I did not find satisfactory and which I rejected. However, I am prepared to approach the application on the basis that the respondents exceeding their entitlement under s 103B would cause a real impairment of valuable commercial rights to the applicant. Whether this is in any way permanent or otherwise irreparable may perhaps be doubted. If there has been infringement, the profit derived by the respondents from Hutchison and Vodafone would be readily able to be ascertained. Any difficulty in that ascertainment would almost certainly work against the respondents rather than in their favour in accordance with well-understood principle. And as to the use by the respondents themselves on the Foxsports website, a putative licence fee could, no doubt, be calculated.

53 On the other hand, if I grant an injunction and if it turns out that the applicant fails, whilst there would be an undertaking as to damages the interference with the businesses, not only of the respondents but also Hutchison and Vodafone, would be extremely difficult to quantify. The respondents, Hutchison and Vodafone, would not have the ability to call upon the kind of account of profits that the applicant would if the reverse were the case. Further, the nature of the status quo ante favours, in my view, withholding any relief. The evidence reflects that the footage of NRL matches on internet and mobile phones in 2007 is at least comparable to that which occurred in 2006.</text>
