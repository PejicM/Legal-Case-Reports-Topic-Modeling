<text>1 This is an appeal from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett given on 21 March 2007: SZJUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 439. His Honour dismissed, with costs, an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") signed on 25 October 2006 and given on 14 November 2006.

2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He arrived in Australia on 20 October 2004. On 3 December 2004 he applied for a protection (class XA) visa. On 7 March 2005 a delegate of the respondent Minister refused that application. The appellant then sought review of that decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 4 August 2005. The appellant then sought judicial review.

3 On 5 June 2006 Federal Magistrate Barnes made orders by consent quashing the Tribunal's decision and remitting the application for reconsideration. The appellant was then invited to attend a second Tribunal hearing, which he did. Ultimately, the Tribunal rejected his application. In doing so, it found that his evidence was not credible, largely because the claims that he advanced before the first Tribunal differed in certain respects from his claims before the second Tribunal.

4 The appellant's claims can be briefly stated. He says that he is a member of Falun Gong, and that by reason of that fact, he faces persecution if required to return to China.

5 In his application for a protection visa the appellant said that he was born in Fujian, China, in 1972 and was married in 1996. His wife and daughter continue to reside in China. He said that he was a sales/department manager prior to coming to Australia, and had held that position from March 2003 to October 2004. He claimed that he had been unemployed from February 1996 until February 2003 and that prior to that he had been a construction worker and a farmer. He claimed that he left China legally using a passport issued in his name in Fujian in November 2002 which would expire in November 2007. He claimed that he had had difficulties, which he detailed as "bribery", obtaining his passport. He claimed that his passport was not valid for return to China because "it must have been blacklisted".</text>
