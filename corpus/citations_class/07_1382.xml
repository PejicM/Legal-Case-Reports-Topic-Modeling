<text>6 The international conventions that govern the carriage of goods by sea using bills of lading and similar documents in non-charterparty carriage deal variously with onus or burden of proof. The issues that can be raised in respect of the respective and related operation of Articles 3 and 4 of the Hague Rules and the Hague-Visby Rules are not straightforward (despite the passage of over 80 years from the conferences at London, The Hague and Brussels) and not finally settled: cf Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co (A/Asia) Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142, Great China Metal Industries Co Ltd v Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1999) 196 CLR 161 and Davies M and Dickey A, Shipping Law (Lawbook Co, 2004) at 212-213 . The Hamburg Rules in Article 5 sought to remove the complexities of this onus question by substantially shifting the onus to the carrier. These rules have not received universal acclaim. With the exception of some aspects borrowed from them, they do not form the basis of Australian, Hong Kong or Chinese law, which were the alternatives governing this carriage.</text>

<tocase>JJ Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547</tocase>
<text>33 There is force in the proposition of the plaintiffs that in circumstances such as these where the parties have argued to abandon the litigation because of the disproportionate burden of costs, the Court should be slow to order costs against the plaintiff: cf JJ Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547 at 1553-54 and Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 116 ALR 523 at 530. Relevant of course is the default such that the party who discontinues often pays costs: O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1650 at [13] . It is appropriate, however, to look at the whole of the circumstances including the kinds of considerations to which I earlier referred, the reasonableness and efficiency of the conduct of the proceedings by all parties, the extent to which parties who were asserting that they were not liable frankly informed the plaintiff with substantiating material of their position, and the contemporaneous views of the commercial parties as to an appropriate course.</text>
