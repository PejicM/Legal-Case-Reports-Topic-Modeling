<tocase>Bell v Queensland (2006) 71 IPR 139</tocase>
<text>43 I am entitled to have regard to that course of conduct. Indeed, s 4K(3) and (4) of the Crimes Act 1914 apply where a person has been charged with a number of offences against the same provision of a law of the Commonwealth. The Court is authorised to impose one penalty in respect of all of the offences, but that penalty is not to exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be imposed if a separate penalty were imposed in respect of each offence. In Bell v Queensland (2006) 71 IPR 139 at 140-141 [6]-[9] Kiefel J considered it appropriate to impose one penalty in respect of a series of offences similar to Mr Vu's; see also Hamm v Middleton (1999) 44 IPR 656 at 659 [15] per von Doussa J.

44 I am satisfied that Mr Vu has shown genuine contrition for his offending. Not only did that appear clearly from the report of the Probation and Parole Service, but in his evidence before me I consider him to have been genuinely remorseful and to have recognised that he has exposed himself to pay whatever penalty the court might extract from him as a result of his foolishness and dishonesty.

45 Mr Vu pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. The police argues that his guilty plea must be seen in the context of an acknowledgment of the strength of the police case and a recognition of the inevitable.</text>

<tocase>Chen v New South Wales Police Service (2003) 59 IPR 431</tocase>
<text>59 In Chen v New South Wales Police Service (2003) 59 IPR 431 Jacobson J dealt with eight offences of infringement of copyright contrary to ss 132(1)(b) and (2A)(a) of the Act. In that case the offender had pleaded guilty before the magistrate to the eight offences and was then placed on a good behaviour bond for five years and ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty totalling $8,000. The penalty was payable in monthly instalments over a protracted period. The offender had sold counterfeit DVDs at a market on four occasions and had been found in possession of over 400 infringing CDs. And, at her brother's premises there were music CDs, DVDs, blank disks, paperwork and business cards in her name. She also had about 50 DVDs and two computers on which were found files of infringing films. The offender in that case was a single mother whose son had an illness and she had little means. His Honour came to the view that the penalty imposed was one which was proper and refused leave to appeal against the sentence.

60 In this matter, although Mr Vu's period of offending stretched over a considerable period of about 10 months, it involved him being a distributor, rather than a manufacturer, of the infringing copies. I have had regard to his genuine contrition, all of the circumstances that I have described more fully above, including his early plea of guilty, his partial co-operation, and his invidious position (which I do not regard, and which he does not ask me to regard, as an excuse but as a circumstance in which the offending occurred). I am satisfied that he is a man who has done something which he knows was inappropriate and he is very unlikely to re-offend. It would not be appropriate to sentence him to prison. Having regard to his means and the impact on him financially, the totality of the circumstances, including his criminality and the need for general deterrence, I am of opinion that I should allow the appeal.

61 The appropriate penalty which I consider should be imposed is a 3 year good behaviour bond with a self-surety in the sum of $1,000 conditional on Mr Vu paying a penalty of $5,000. He has indicated that he expects to be able to pay this by instalments of $200 per month commencing in November 2007. I have had regard to the fact that the police acknowledge that such a penalty is one within the range properly open to me.


 I certify that the preceding sixty-one (61) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<tocase>Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 215 ALR 213; (2005) 79 ALJR 1048</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/25.html</AustLII>
<text>57 In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the Court engages in a process known as instinctive synthesis. It is impossible to have regard to each of the matters which s 16A(2) requires be taken into account separately or to assign to each of them a particular figure or discount applicable to the offender, having regard to the particular circumstances each subsection addresses. Rather, the Court has to approach the determination of a sentence by taking into account all of the matters that are relevant, including those to which s 16A(2) refers, in addition to all other matters bearing on the sentence that will be imposed in all the circumstances of the offence or offences. In general, the sentencing court will reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed after weighing all of the relevant factors: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 215 ALR 213 at 223 [37] ; [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at 1057 [37] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

58 Because sentencing is a matter involving both an application of the general rule to be found in the statute imposing the penalty for the offence which creates it, and an assessment of the individual culpability of the defendant upon whose plea or finding of guilt a court is adjudicating, no other case can be a precise precedent for the appropriate penalty. Nonetheless, the courts must have regard to imposing penalties that are transparent and consistent and which the community can regard as an appropriate punishment having regard to the penalty which the Parliament has seen fit to impose as the maximum in the particular case. The mere fact that there is a maximum is not, of course, the only criterion by which the court imposes an appropriate penalty.</text>

<tocase>Pontello v Ceselli (1989) 16 IRP 645</tocase>
<text>35 In Pontello v Ceselli (1989) 16 IRP 645 Wilcox J, on a guilty plea, sentenced an offender who had been knowingly concerned in making and possessing numerous illegal copies of video films for the purposes of commercial distribution. He had also been convicted and fined for offences under the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth) arising from the same circumstances. His Honour said ( Ceselli 16 IPR at 647):
 
 'It is, however, appropriate for me to emphasise that the statute does provide for a gaol term for contraventions of s 132(1) and 132(2A). I am informed that, so far as counsel for the informant is aware, no person has yet been gaoled for a breach of those provisions; but the fact that a gaol term is provided by the legislation does indicate the seriousness with which the offences have been regarded by the legislature. It may well be that, in a serious case of multiple infringement of these provisions, it will be appropriate for a gaol sentence to be pronounced.'

36 The offender had made 35 copies of one title, 44 of another out of a total of 237 pirate tapes that had been seized. He had elaborate recording equipment at his home which enabled him to make multiple copies of individual tapes. Again that is distinct from the present case, albeit the defendant there was a video shop proprietor.

53 Nonetheless, as was said in 1989 by Wilcox J in Ceselli 16 IPR at 647 and by Sheppard J in Giannotis 16 IPR at 186, the time must surely come in this country where custodial sentences are appropriate for offences involving sale or hire of counterfeit DVDs and similar works. There are, however, factors in this case which have inclined me to the opinion that that is not an appropriate penalty in this matter, as I will explain below.</text>

<tocase>Pontello v Giannotis (1989) 16 IPR 174</tocase>
<text>37 In a related case, Pontello v Giannotis (1989) 16 IPR 174 at 186 Sheppard J observed that there was no doubt that piracy in the video industry was rife and that it was something that was well known. He referred to Wilcox J's remarks quoted above and also said that there was no doubt that this species of crime is often difficult to detect. Sheppard J said that the legislature had obviously taken a serious view of the offences, referring to the amendments that had been made in 1986 which provided for substantial increases in the penalties. Those penalties, I understand, obtained to the time of the present offences but have now been replaced by the sections to which I referred at the commencement of this judgment. As his Honour also noted (16 IPR at 187), the offence under s 132(2A)(a) was a serious one. DVDs have largely replaced videos as a means of viewing films.

53 Nonetheless, as was said in 1989 by Wilcox J in Ceselli 16 IPR at 647 and by Sheppard J in Giannotis 16 IPR at 186, the time must surely come in this country where custodial sentences are appropriate for offences involving sale or hire of counterfeit DVDs and similar works.

<tocase>R v Carter (1992) 13 Cr App R (S) 576</tocase>
<text>38 A number of jurisdictions have regarded the conduct of those who manufacture, sell or hire counterfeit works such as DVDs as meriting imprisonment. For example, in R v Carter (1992) 13 Cr App R (S) 576, the English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division dealt with a defendant who had been found in possession of over 200 infringing copies, 500 blank video tapes and three video recorders. Lord Lane CJ, Kennedy and Jowitt JJ noted that a suspended sentence of nine months imprisonment had been imposed and said ( Carter 13 Cr App R (S) at 377):
 
 '... [T]o make and distribute pirate copies of films is to steal from the true owner of the copyright, the property for which he has to expend money in order to possess it. It is an offence really of dishonesty.' 


 
I agree. In R v Kemp (1995) 16 Cr App R (S) 941 at 943 Russell LJ, Turner and Hooper JJ said:
 
 'Offences of counterfeiting are offences which normally attract at least a short sentence of imprisonment. They are difficult, time consuming and expensive to detect. The owners of copyrights are entitled to be protected against their unlawful exploitation. They are entitled to have their commercial reputation protected against those who would seek unlawfully to damage it.'</text>

<tocase>R v Duckett [1998] 2 Cr App R (S) 59</tocase>
<text>39 And, in R v Duckett [1998] 2 Cr App R (S) 59 at 60 Jowitt and Astill JJ sitting as the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division said:
 
 'Infringement of copyright is widespread. It does, in an ethical sense, involve stealing other men's property, and in its cumulative effect is able to cause serious damage to legitimate commercial and proprietary interests. Although the applicant did not engage in this dishonest business in a substantial way, his activities and those of many like him contribute to the damage to which we have referred. A serious view is to be taken of the distribution by way of business and the recording for such distribution of pirated material which, if bought legitimately, would cost substantial sums of money.'

40 There, the appellant had been sentenced to 27 months imprisonment, in circumstances in which he actually manufactured illegal CD-ROM disks and was a ring leader of seven defendants in a counterfeiting business. Mr Vu's criminality is not of that order.

41 There are no other offences that are required or permitted to be taken into account.</text>

<tocase>R v Sutton (2004) 41 MVR 40; [2004] NSWCCA 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCCA/2004/225.html</AustLII>
<text>46 I am of opinion Mr Vu was genuine in pleading guilty and that he promptly acknowledged that he had done something that was wrong. He has not made any attempt to seek to excuse himself from, or to evade, his responsibility for what he did. His statement to the Parole Service that he would pay whatever penalty the court imposed on him demonstrated that. I am quite satisfied that, in his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, he was doing what a basically honest person who has made a stupid mistake and engaged in a series of foolish and dishonest criminal acts could be expected to do once the cold light of day had exposed him to a recognition of his own wrongdoing. As Howie J said giving the reasons of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Sutton (2004) 41 MVR 40; [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12] :
 
 'This Court has pointed out, time and time again, that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence.'

47 I am of opinion that this was a genuine guilty plea which Mr Vu made at the first available opportunity. Indeed, had Mr Vu been charged shortly after the first visits of the Federation officers, I am sure that his criminal conduct would have ceased then, although I cannot, and do not, take that into account. I reject the police's submission that I should give less than full weight to the plea of guilty.

48 Mr Vu did co-operate with the authorities to a degree, although, as the police pointed out, he made only admissions to hiring out copyright infringing DVDs and not to selling them to the Federation officers. It is not suggested that he concealed or hid any of the material which implicated him in his guilt for the offences. He readily made admissions relating to having purchased the counterfeit DVDs. He also pointed out to the police (when they executed the search warrant) where the counterfeit DVDs were and made admissions as to hiring them out. Although his co-operation was perhaps not as fulsome as his evidence has been today or his admissions to his Honour were, I find that he has co-operated to a significant degree with the authorities. There was evidence of some sales to the Federation officers. But, Mr Vu did not sell the counterfeits on any significant scale. Rather, the sales occurred infrequently from his stock of DVDs used primarily for the hire business.

49 Most significantly I must have regard to the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on Mr Vu. I am satisfied that Mr Vu knows he must be punished. The likelihood that he would re-offend is minimal to non-existent.

50 I am satisfied that the sentence I am to impose will adequately punish Mr Vu for his offences. In that regard I must have, as the police reminds me, regard to the strength of the police's case, the objective gravity of the offences, the need for general deterrence and the need for strong subjective deterrence. As I have said, the latter consideration is one which Mr Vu had accepted himself will be worked on him by a sentence of any kind.

56 Mr Vu has argued that the effect of imprisoning him even on weekend detention would be such as to work a very adverse result on his family. No doubt some embarrassment would be caused to him in having to explain to his children what he had done and why he was to spend time in gaol. His sense of shame at having to do this would be significant and would cause him considerable embarrassment. Nonetheless, the authorities make it clear that in approaching an assessment of the effect on Mr Vu's family and dependents I must interpret s 16A(2)(p) by having regard to whether these circumstances are exceptional: see R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405 ; (2002) 134 A Crim R 286 at 293 [31] per Howie J with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed. I am not satisfied that the matters on which Mr Vu relies are exceptional.</text>
