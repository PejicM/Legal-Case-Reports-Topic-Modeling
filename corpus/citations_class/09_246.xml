<text>This proceeding is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ( Applicant S142/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 969) dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") made on 2 November 2007 and published on 6 November 2007. By that decision, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent to refuse the grant of a protection visa to the appellant, a national of Bangladesh.

The appellant contends by his notice of appeal that his Honour, Federal Magistrate Cameron, erred in a way reflecting jurisdictional error by incorrectly "interpreting" the applicable law and incorrectly "applying" the relevant law to the facts of the case. Secondly, the Tribunal failed, it is said, to comply with s 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") by relying on information not put to the appellant and not discussed with the appellant, in reaching its decision. Thirdly, the Tribunal failed, it is said, to comply with s 424A(1)(b) of the Migration Act by failing to give the appellant particulars of "the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable". Fourthly, it is said that the Tribunal failed to give the appellant any opportunity to contest or comment upon independent country information relied upon by the Tribunal in reaching its decision. These grounds of appeal, however, fail to identify the particular information said to have been relied upon by the Tribunal and not put to the appellant.

The appellant was self-represented before this Court with the assistance of an interpreter. The appellant has some understanding of English. He says that he can speak, read and write English although poorly. He speaks, reads and writes the Bengali language. Although these reasons are formulated for the benefit of all parties, the explanation of the basis for the Court's decision is set out with the appellant particularly in mind as the appellant is not represented by legal advisers and an interpreter will be called upon to explain to the appellant the reasons for the decision. I will seek to set out the reasons as plainly as possible.

The appellant contends that the decision of the Tribunal is unfair as he has now been in Australia for 10 years. The appellant says he holds a genuine fear of harm should he return to Bangladesh. He says he seeks "a fresh look at his case" by this Court. He says that the first decision of the Tribunal made on 9 October 2001 was set aside and thus his claims were shown to be genuine whereas the second Tribunal failed to examine and consider his claims of involvement in Bangladesh with a political party and claims of harassment of him in Bangladesh by opponents of that political party.

To the extent that the appellant is seeking to say that the Tribunal failed to consider his claims of a well-founded fear of persecution based upon his involvement with a political party in Bangladesh through which he gave expression to his political opinions, or that the Tribunal failed to examine evidence of his involvement in the affairs of that political party which he says is the factual foundation for his well-founded fear of persecution (see ss 5(1) , 36 (2), 65 (1) of the Migration Act and Articles 1 and 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ), the appellant is contending that the Tribunal failed to discharge its statutory duty of review conferred upon it by the Migration Act (see ss 411 and 414 of the Migration Act ).</text>

<tocase>S142 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 582</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/582.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant arrived in Australia on 4 March 1998 and applied for a protection visa on 2 April 1998. The appellant lodged an extensive and detailed typewritten statement with his application, prepared by his migration agent based upon instructions given to the agent by the appellant, in which he explained why he left Bangladesh; the fear he held of what might happen to him should he return; the reasons for that fear; the groups who might harm him; and, why the authorities in Bangladesh might not be either able or willing to protect him. The Minister's delegate on 16 April 1998 refused to grant him a protection visa. On 11 May 1998, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of that refusal. The appellant was invited to attend an oral hearing before the Tribunal on 1 May 2000. The appellant said he would attend that hearing. The hearing was postponed to 21 June 2000. The appellant attended the postponed hearing and gave oral evidence in support of his claims. On 23 April 2001, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant regretting the delay in finalising a review of the delegate's decision to refuse a protection visa. The Tribunal said in its letter that a decision would be forthcoming within a few weeks and further said that if any new information relevant to his claims was available, appropriate documents should be submitted to the Tribunal in English. The Tribunal attached to its letter documents reflecting independent evidence obtained by the Tribunal after the hearing on 21 June 2000 which was to be considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decision. The appellant was given an extension of time to 21 May 2001 to provide any response and did so on 21 May 2001. On 9 October 2001, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate. That decision was published on 30 October 2001 and set aside by Federal Magistrate Smith ( S142 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 582) on 30 March 2007. That proceeding had a long history commencing with an Order nisi in the High Court of Australia on 17 April 2003 and remittal of the proceeding to the Federal Court of Australia and then to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. Federal Magistrate Smith concluded that the Tribunal had denied the appellant natural justice in not putting to him for comment matters thought by the Tribunal to be relevant in reaching its decision namely, the impact for the appellant of the election in October 2001 of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ("BNP") to government and the loss of government by the Awami League (although the Awami League had stepped aside according to interim arrangements in August 2001). Federal Magistrate Smith also noted that the Tribunal in its reasons had made an error of fact by making references to claims made by the appellant concerning the intimidation in Bangladesh of his father, by Awami League supporters, by describing those events as references to the appellant's grandfather. Accordingly, Federal Magistrate Smith quashed the Tribunal's decision and made an order directing the Tribunal to determine the appellant's application for review according to law.

The Tribunal constituted by a different member embarked upon a reconsideration of the appellant's application and on 20 July 2007 the appellant gave oral evidence before the Tribunal. On 22 August 2007, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to comment upon information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or at least a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. That letter was an extensive letter of seven pages sent to the appellant pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act . The letter called for comments by 14 September 2007. On 4 September 2007, the appellant wrote to the Tribunal advising that he was unable to provide a response by 14 September 2007. He said that he would require evidence from members of the Freedom Party in Bangladesh with whom he said he had been associated and that he would require an extension of three months' time to collect the necessary documents to enable him to respond. The appellant said that he was communicating with the President of the Freedom Party, Colonel Faruk, who as at 4 September 2007, was under arrest awaiting the carrying out of the death penalty by the Bangladeshi government. The appellant said that was seeking evidence from Colonel Faruk. The file copy of the letter is endorsed with a handwritten note by the Tribunal member signed and dated 13 September 2001 by which an officer of the Tribunal is directed to advise the appellant by telephone and in writing that no extension would be granted. On 13 September 2007, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant advising him that his request had been considered carefully but that a decision had been reached not to grant an extension of time. On 18 October 2007, the Tribunal advised the appellant that a decision would be handed down on 6 November 2007. On 1 November 2007, the appellant wrote to the Tribunal advising that he had received a letter from the Freedom Party Leader on 31 October 2007 by facsimile. A copy of that letter was attached to the appellant's letter. The appellant asked the Tribunal to consider that evidence prior to handing down its decision. The appellant also told the Tribunal in that letter: 
 There is nothing to response or make any comments on the information sought from me in the tribunal's letter dated 22 August 2007 because the information and incidents happened long 13 years ago and general human being may forgot various issues. There is nothing contradict for a fair minded observer to consider my fear of persecution in my home country Bangladesh.

The Tribunal in reaching its decision published on 6 November 2007 considered the appellant's letter of 1 November 2007 and the enclosure. Background facts put to the Tribunal</text>

<text>To the extent that the appellant calls upon this Court to re-examine the underlying merits of the Tribunal's decision or consider "afresh" the decision reached by the Tribunal, it simply cannot do so. If the Tribunal misconceived the question to be addressed in conducting its review or failed to correctly identify the elements of the law to be applied or failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by failing to examine the central evidence relied upon by the appellant as a basis for his contended well-founded fear of persecution or failed to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act , a basis for review by this Court of the Tribunal's decision on grounds of jurisdictional error, arises. Otherwise, at least so far as this case is concerned in the context of the appellant's claims, he simply seeks a review by this Court of the underlying merits of the administrative decision of the Tribunal as an exercise of executive power. It is not open to this Court to undertake that task (see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang &amp; Ors [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey J, McHugh J and Gummow J adopting the observations of Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35 and 36). The question to be determined is whether there is error on the part of the Tribunal in the exercise of its review jurisdiction not error in the sense of whether a different decision might or could have been reached as a matter of decision-making, concerning the various facts put before the Tribunal in support of the protection visa application.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (1999) 168 ALR 407</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/1.html</AustLII>
<text>It is clear from a consideration of the Tribunal's reasons that detailed consideration was given to the claims made by the appellant in the documentation lodged in support of his protection visa application of 2 April 1998 and the oral evidence given in support of his application at each Tribunal hearing (21 June 2000 and 20 July 2007). The Tribunal having evaluated that material identified a number of inconsistencies which it describes as significant. It was open to the Tribunal to weigh the impact of the perceived inconsistencies and the appellant's explanation of them. The Tribunal was not satisfied that a loss of memory and the suffering of stress provided a compelling explanation for the inconsistencies. The Tribunal accepted that the passage of time might affect an individual's capacity to recall all relevant details relating to the particular claims. However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that this explanation was an answer to the inconsistencies the Tribunal identified. The conclusion that the appellant could not be believed in the light of those inconsistencies and that the appellant was not reliable and thus his claims were untrue represents a finding of fact as to credibility, squarely within the fact-finding role of the Tribunal ( Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (1999) 168 ALR 407 per McHugh J at [67]). Plainly, the Tribunal's findings were open to it for the reasons identified by it. There is no error of law or jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in reaching those conclusions.

In reaching its decision on 2 November 2007 the Tribunal was plainly influenced by the inconsistencies it identified between the detailed statement of facts and circumstances lodged by the appellant with his application for a protection visa on 2 April 1998 and oral evidence given before the Tribunal, particularly on 20 July 2007. That evidence consisted of the appellant's recollection on that day of events that had occurred throughout his life but particularly events from 1994 until his departure from Bangladesh to Australia in March 1998. The oral evidence also consisted of the appellant's recollection or lack of recollection of events that he described in his detailed statement of 2 April 1998 concerning the events surrounding the death of his father's brother (step-brother) and events of harassment of his father which were said to have resulted in his becoming almost crippled in 1989. By 20 July 2007, 9 years had elapsed since the formulation of his written statement of 2 April 1998, 34 years had elapsed since the events of 1973 when his father was said to have been jailed and treated badly and 18 years had elapsed since the events in 1989 when his father was said to have been almost crippled by a beating. Although it is not clear from the written statement precisely when the appellant says his uncle was killed, it seems to have occurred after August 1995 and probably after mid-1997 when, according to the appellant, contrived criminal charges were brought against the appellant. In describing why authorities would not be able to protect him he said in his written statement: 
 If the protection and other facilities from the authority would [be] available in Bangladesh my uncle would not be killed brutally and the killers would not move around freely.

Accordingly, by the time the appellant gave evidence on 20 July 2007, either 12 years or 10 years had elapsed since the events concerning the contended brutal killing of his uncle had taken place.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant says that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act by relying on information not put to the appellant and not discussed with the appellant in reaching its decision. That contention fails to identify the information relied upon by the Tribunal and not put to the appellant. In that sense, the claim or ground of appeal is lacking any content at all. There is simply no information identified by the appellant which would fall within s 424A(1). The Tribunal is not required to put its reasoning process to the appellant or the content of its proposed reasons to be published, to enable the appellant to comment before making the decision ( SZBYR &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ at [17]). In any event, the Tribunal by its letter of 22 August 2007 put to the appellant the series of inconsistencies about which it was concerned. However, all of that information derived from material put by the appellant to the Tribunal.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/264.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant also contends that the Tribunal relied upon independent country information and to the extent that the appellant rests his belief that the Tribunal contravened s 424A(1) because it failed to provide details of that information to him, it is clear that the Tribunal has no obligation to put independent country information to him under s 424A(1)(a) as that information is information "not specifically about [the appellant]" and is simply "about a class of persons of which [the appellant] is a member" and is thus within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW &amp; Ors [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 per Beaumont J at [66] to [70]; per Merkel and Hely JJ at [123] to [138]). In any event, the Tribunal put to the appellant independent country information relating to formation of the Liberal Party and noted the inconsistency between that information and the appellant's evidence as to when and how he became involved with the Freedom Party.

The appellant also contends that the Tribunal failed to provide him with details of "the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable". That failure was said to be a contravention of s 424A(1)(b) which is an obligation imposed upon the Tribunal to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the appellant understands why the information is relevant to the review and the consequences of the information being relied upon in affirming the decision under review. The Tribunal's letter of 22 August 2007 makes very clear the identified inconsistencies, the Tribunal's concern about those inconsistencies and the consequences for the review of the delegate's decision should the Tribunal rely upon the inconsistencies in forming a view about the appellant's credibility. There is no basis in the claim that the Tribunal, in electing to issue its letter of 22 August 2007, failed to properly draw these matters to the appellant's attention.

The appellant by his notice of appeal contends that Federal Magistrate Cameron erred by incorrectly interpreting the relevant law and incorrectly applied the relevant law to the facts. There is simply no content to the ground of appeal and no demonstrated error on the part of Federal Magistrate Cameron.</text>
