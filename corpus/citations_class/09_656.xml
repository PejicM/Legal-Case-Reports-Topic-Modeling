<tocase>Aldersea v Public Transport Corporation (2001) 3 VR 499</tocase>
<text>Counsel for Ms Yousif also contended that there was a term implied by law that the Bank would act in good faith. An authority cited in support of the implication of such a term was the judgment of Rothman J in Russell v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney [2007] NSWSC 104 ; (2007) 69 NSWLR 198. However, there is a preponderance of authority against the implication of such a term: Aldersea v Public Transport Corporation (2001) 3 VR 499 ; Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd (2005) 226 ALR 114 ; [2005] FCA 1678 ; McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 168 IR 375 ; [2007] FCA 1903. Was there a breach of the implied terms?</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/IRCA/1996/371.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for Ms Yousif relied on a line of authority which has accepted that a term of trust and confidence is implied by law in contracts of employment. By this term an employer must not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the parties as employee and employer: Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd [1996] IRCA 371 ; (1996) 142 ALR 144 ; Malik v Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International SA (in liq) [1997] UKHL 23 ; [1998] AC 20 ( Malik ); Gogay v Hertfordshire County Council [2000] IRLR 783 ; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; [2002] FCA 939 ; Russell v Trustees of Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney [2008] NSWCA 217 ; (2008) 176 IR 82. The effect of the conduct must be viewed objectively: Malik [1997] UKHL 23 ; [1998] AC 20 at 47B and G per Lord Steyn.</text>
