<text>Moreover, this is a case where the entitlement of the appellant to complain of a possible denial of procedural fairness would depend upon whether there was evidence that he was misled: cf Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [34] .

It seems to me that the finding of the Federal Magistrate, set out at [44] above, that the appellant responded to the Tribunal without any misapprehension, forecloses the possibility of any valid complaint. Indeed, this is reinforced by the Federal Magistrate's observations, referred to at [45] above, about the appellant's attempts to mislead the Tribunal.

It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding sixty-one (61) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>In SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [52] - [53] , I expressed the view that the effect of the authorities is that the word "considers" in s 424A(1)(a) is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case; it is for the court to determine objectively whether the Tribunal considered the information to be dispositively relevant; see also Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [12] .

The information in the present case was quite different from that which was considered by the High Court in VEAL. In that case, an informant's letter was adverse to the applicant and contained information that was "credible, relevant and significant". Here, the equivocation about Mr Liu's involvement was not of that character. The information that was adverse was that Mr Liu had been held legally responsible for supply false certificates. The appellant was given full opportunity to deal with this.</text>

<text>In any event, the information in the email that it was not clear whether Mr Liu was implicated, was not "adverse" information within the test stated by Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 628-629.</text>

<text>In SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] , a Full Court drew attention to the word "considers" in s 424A(1). Their Honours said that the effect of this is that s 424A(1) is only enlivened where the Tribunal forms the opinion that particular information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. In MZXQB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27] , Heerey J described the test as one of "dispositive relevance".</text>

<text>The question of whether s 424A(1) was engaged is to be determined in advance, and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case; the need for "unbundling" of the Tribunal's reasons is "correspondingly reduced": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] , [22].</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83</tocase>
<text>The question of whether s 422B(3) imposes a substantive obligation of fairness was considered by a Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83, the decision in which was handed down immediately before the publication of these reasons.

The effect of that decision is to dispose of the present appeal adversely to the appellant. This is because the Full Court held at [16]-[18] that s 422B(3) did not qualify the express statement in s 422B(1) that Div 4 contains an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with.

As the Full Court said in SZMOK , at [16], s 422B(3) is not a free standing obligation; it draws content from the other provisions of Div 4. It therefore cannot require s 424A to be interpreted as imposing an obligation not found to exist on the proper construction of that section. Here, there is nothing in s 424A which would have required the Tribunal to provide the full text of the email that was supplied to it by the Chinese speaking staff member to the appellant.</text>
