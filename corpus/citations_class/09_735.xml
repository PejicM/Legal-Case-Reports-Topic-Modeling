<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd (2007) ATPR p42-210</tocase>
<text>The Commission relies on s 6 of the Trade Practices Act to extend the operation of s 45 to natural persons if their conduct relates to trade with Australia. This would make the liability of the individual respondents direct and not ancillary to that of the corporate respondents. There was some discussion of the availability of that section in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd (2007) ATPR p42-210.

The Commission points to the various positions of employment of the individual April foreign respondents, the structure of the APRIL Group's operations, the nature of the meetings and the arrangements entered into to infer that the individuals were present on behalf of each of April FPT, April Holdings and April Management and that the relevant conduct was engaged in on behalf of those corporate respondents.

Annexed to these reasons (Annexure A) is a chart provided by the Commission of the structure of the APRIL Group and the position of the individual April foreign respondents within that structure. The evidence supports the conclusions drawn in the chart as to the relationship of the corporations and individuals named. The evidence also provides the basis for an inference that Mr Lim and Mr Choo were officers of April FPT, April Holdings and April Management in the capacity of being very senior sales and marketing executives with regional, if not worldwide, responsibilities, so that the conduct of the individuals is attributable to those corporations.</text>

<tocase>Beluga Shipping GmbH &amp; Co KS "Beluga Fantastic" v Headway Shipping Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 ; (2008) 251 ALR 620</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1770.html</AustLII>
<text>The question is whether, on the material before the Court, facts are established or inferences are open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed. The reference in these reasons to the evidence and conclusions should be understood as referring to what the evidence establishes and what conclusions may be drawn at a prima facie level. The material relied upon by the Commission is in the form of untested allegations and evidence but it is appropriate to proceed on the basis of them in order to assess whether facts are established and inferences can be drawn which would establish a prima facie case ( Beluga Shipping GmbH &amp; Co KS "Beluga Fantastic" v Headway Shipping Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 ; (2008) 251 ALR 620 at [32] per Rares J). The prima facie case against the April foreign respondents

The Commission's case is that individuals employed within the APRIL Group and representing each of April FPT, April Holdings and April Management attended meetings of a club called the AAA Club at which price fixing agreements were made, being arrangements or understandings within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act and the Codes.

The AAA Club refers to an alleged loose association or club, the members of which were the APRIL Group, the Advance Agro Group and the APP Group, as well as the Thai Paper Group and the UPM Group. The case made by the Commission is that the primary object of the AAA Club was to discuss and reach consensus about prices at which each group of companies would supply paper products in various markets, including Australia.</text>

<tocase>Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317</tocase>
<text>The Commission needs to establish a prima facie case for the relief claimed. As the application for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction is interlocutory in nature, hearsay evidence is admissible ( Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317 at [58]).

It is not necessary to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought pursuant to each of the causes of action relied upon. It is sufficient if a prima facie case for the relief sought is made out for any one of the causes of action relied upon ( Bray at [47]-[55] per Carr J and [176]-[190] per Branson J).</text>

<tocase>Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners PTE Ltd [2008] FCA 1769</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1769.html</AustLII>
<text>In any event, the Commission submits that the question of discretion is not the overriding consideration in the grant of leave to serve outside the jurisdiction. It relies on what was said by Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners PTE Ltd [2008] FCA 1769 at [7] to the effect that, if the conditions provided for in O 8 r 3 are satisfied, it usually follows that leave to serve outside the jurisdiction will be granted. As it was put by Black CJ and Finkelstein J in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at [3] , if the required conditions for leave are fulfilled, leave should be given in the absence of some countervailing consideration. Their Honours said at [10] that, provided the jurisdiction of the Court is engaged by an action in respect of subject matter with which the Court can deal, the action is instituted by an applicant who has standing, the action is not oppressive, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process and the Court can assume jurisdiction over the defendant, the Court cannot refuse to adjudicate the dispute. Their Honours continued at [11] to express the opinion that it would be ' curious and anomalous if matters that could not be raised in answer to the appellant's claim by a defendant served within the jurisdiction could nevertheless be taken into account when deciding whether to allow service out of the jurisdiction '.</text>

<text>This proceeding is of a kind described in Item 13 of the Table to O 8 r 2. It is sufficient for the grant of leave if any one of the causes of action falls within an item in the Table to O 8 r 2 ( Webster Computer Systems Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 825 at [11] and [12] per Conti J).

The Commission relies upon other items listed in the Table to O 8 r 2. It is not necessary for the purposes of this application to consider those further. Prima facie case for the relief claimed</text>
