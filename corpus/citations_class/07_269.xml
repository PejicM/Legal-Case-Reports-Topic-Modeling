<tocase>Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1560.html</AustLII>
<text>8 The scheme of the legislative provisions is comprehensively set out in the decision of Finn J in Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280 at [5] - [61] . These paragraphs provide a sufficient description of the scheme for present purposes, and it is not necessary to repeat the details of the process here. In his discussion of the scheme, his Honour noted at [6] that it involves four tiers or steps:
 
 'The first three relate to determining whether (inter alia) a medical practitioner has engaged in "inappropriate practice" in connection with the rendering or initiating of services for which a medicare benefit was available. The fourth tier or step involves the imposition of a sanction on a practitioner who has been found to have engaged in "inappropriate practice."'

9 'Inappropriate practice' is defined in s 82. In the case of a general practitioner, the test is whether the conduct of the general practitioner in connection with the rendering of services would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners: s 82(1)(a).

10 The first step involves the Commission's decision to make an investigative referral to the Director in relation to the conduct of an individual as to whether that person engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with the rendering or initiating of services: s 86(1). This stage contemplates that there has previously been a complaint or inquiry by the Commission into the conduct of the practitioner. The investigation must be sufficient to enable the Commission to form a view that the practitioner may have engaged in inappropriate practice.

20 In Pradhan v Holmes, Finn J usefully encapsulates at [49]-[61] by reference to the above provisions the detailed staged process provided to afford procedural fairness under the statute at each of the four levels of consideration. It is against these comprehensive statutory provisions that the application and submissions as to procedural fairness in the present case ought to be considered.

21 Dr Phan was the subject of Investigative Referral No. 190 made by the Commission on 29 June 2000. The Investigative Referral related to all services rendered or initiated in the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 (the relevant referral period in this case). During this period, Dr Phan rendered a total of 18, 165 services, including 17, 970 level B surgery consultations.

22 Adjudicative Referral No. 190 was made by the Director to the Committee on 29 March 2001, and the hearing took place before the Committee on 16-17 May, 2-3 August and 4 October 2001.

23 On 4 March 2004, emails were sent by the Committee Secretary, Ms Vanessa Goodspeed, to Professor Nicholls, seeking guidance in relation to the sampling methodology adopted by the Committee. This advice was provided by Professor Nicholls on 5 March 2004.

24 On 26 June 2004, the Committee made its draft report, with Dr Phan furnishing submissions to the Committee in relation to that report on 20 July 2004. The Committee considered these and made its final report on 28 October 2004.</text>

<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>36 It is common ground that failure to give procedural fairness can result in jurisdictional error in some cases. The Applicant refers to the principles set out in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 584-5 where it is said:
 
 'The law has now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights, interests and legitimate expectations, subject only to the clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention. ... 
 
 The critical question in most cases is not whether the principles of natural justice apply. It is: what does the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular case? ... 
 
 In this respect the expression "procedural fairness" more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case. The statutory power must be exercised fairly, i.e., in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual considered in the light of the statutory requirements, the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes, whether public or private, which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations.'

37 In written submissions, the Applicant refers to the following principles:
 
 
 'a. A person should have matters adverse to that person or that person's application put to that person for comment or evidence before an adverse decision is made (Kioa v West) [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550). 
 
 b. A decision-maker should not make a decision having had regard to undisclosed material being adverse information that was credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made without first putting that material to the relevant person ( Kioa, ibid, at 629.3 per Brennan J; Re Refugee Review Tribunal, Ex party Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57; and Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966). 
 
 c. A decision-maker should bring to a person's attention the critical issue or factor on which the decision is likely to turn so that the person may have an opportunity to deal with it (eg: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [81] ). 
 
 d. A decision-maker should not mislead a party as to the importance of a factor to the decision-maker (either actively or impliedly) ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966).'</text>

<tocase>Cornall v A.B. [1995] 1 VR 372</tocase>
<text>40 The importance of looking at the decision-making process in its entirety was referred to in the decision of Cornall v A.B. [1995] 1 VR 372 which concerned the application of a scheme of review in relation to an alleged breach of professional standards by a solicitor. In that case, the statutory scheme provided for a staged process of investigation and referral before the making of a final determination. The Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court observed, at 396, that it is not a requirement in every case that an investigative body must afford a person under investigation an opportunity to be heard before the body can recommend a further step which could result in a determination of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature. At 397, the Court noted that consideration of the relevant principle may properly begin with a statement of S.A. de Smith in his Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4 th ed.) p. 199 , which reads:
 
 "Where an act or proposal is only the first step in a sequence of measures which may culminate in a decision detrimental to a person's interests, the courts will generally decline to accede to that person's submission that he is entitled to be heard in opposition to this final act, particularly if he is entitled to be heard at a later stage."

41 Their Honours decided that the common law principles of natural justice could be modified or displaced where a legislative intent could be discerned from a statutory scheme. In the case of Cornall , the requirements of natural justice were considered to have been satisfied by the statutory scheme leading to the ultimate determination, having regard to the entire process from the complaint to the final determination. The requirements of procedural fairness were therefore considered to have been exclusively prescribed by the detailed statutory scheme, and there was no room for the implication of procedural fairness in addition to those provided by the Legal Profession Practice Act 1958 (Vic) . Their Honours also referred to the decision of Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596, where Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ said at 598:
 
 "It can be taken as settled, that, when a statute confers power upon a public official to destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations, the rules of natural justice regulate the exercise of that power unless they are excluded by plain words of necessary intendment."</text>

<text>42 The question is whether the statutory provisions are effective to exclude any supplementary duty of fairness under the common law. In order to exclude the rules of natural justice, the legislative intent must be clearly evident and cannot be discerned from indirect references, uncertain inferences or equivocal considerations: Commissioner of Police v Tanos [1958] HCA 6 ; (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 396.</text>

<tocase>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/10.html</AustLII>
<text>43 In assessing the procedural fairness requirements in the present case, a relevant consideration is whether the respective decisions of the Director and the Committee may be said to part of the one decision-making process. In the matter of Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564, the High Court considered whether the operation of the Criminal Justice Commission of QLD and Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee could be said to be part of a unitary decision-making process. This, in their Honours' view, was an essential requirement in excluding the duty. At 578, Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ noted:
 
 'It is not in doubt that, where a decision-making process involves different steps or stages before a final decision is made, the requirements of natural justice are satisfied if "the decision-making process, viewed in its entirety, entails procedural fairness" (South Australia v. O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; (1987) 163 CLR 378 at 389) .'

44 Accordingly, it is permissible to have regard to the scheme as a whole. Looking at the process in the present case in its entirety, the contested decisions of the Director and Committee were clearly part of, and directed to, the ultimate determination by the Determining Authority. They may be characterised as part of a single, sequentially-stepped decision-making process leading to a final outcome. This consideration leads to the conclusion that the legislative scheme is sufficiently exhaustive to indicate a legislative intent to exclude the application of additional measures to achieve procedural fairness.

45 As counsel for the Respondents points out, and as appears from the material attached to the Adjudicative Referral, the reports prepared by Dr Davidson and Dr Dawson were not before the Committee, which proceeded to hear the matter on the material before it. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Committee's decision was "infected" or "poisoned" in any way by the two reports.

46 In this case, I am satisfied that the statutory scheme, considered as a whole, exclusively provided for procedural fairness principles to the extent that the legislature intended those principles to apply. I am satisfied that in its entirety, the process in fact afforded procedural fairness to the Applicant in respect of the Director's decision. Accordingly, I do not consider that there is any substance in the procedural fairness argument based on the Director's examination of the reports of Dr Davidson and Dr Dawson.

47 The Applicant also challenges the decision of the Director on the basis that he sent the Committee copies of the 39 medical records together with his Director's Report which stated that it was open to the Committee to make a finding of inappropriate practice in relation to Dr Phan. It is submitted that this sample of records was not "random" because it contained items that had been previously examined by the Director and found to be examples of inappropriate practice. Therefore, the Applicant contends, the samples were not in accordance with the statutory procedure and were biased or skewed in such a way that any decision in relation to them must be invalid.

48 It is common ground that the Commission drew a preliminary random sample and then asked Dr Phan to produce the patient records relating to the item 23 services in that sample. I accept the view of Professor Nicholls that from a statistical point of view, it is irrelevant that the Committee looked at the same random samples and services as the Director. It was the Committee, rather than the Director, which had the authority to decide whether the sample disclosed inappropriate practice.</text>

<tocase>Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (2006) 90 ALD 49</tocase>
<text>49 To support his position, Dr Phan has referred to the decision of Edmonds J in Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (2006) 90 ALD 49. In that case, his Honour decided that the Committee had erred in its sampling by failing to examine samples randomly drawn from a preliminary random sample as required by Health Insurance (Professional Services Review - Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ("the Determination"). The breach considered by his Honour was clear. The case was decided on the basis that the Committee had examined the first 30 services on lists of the first 40 services taken from lists of random samples furnished by the Commission. They were not therefore 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample' as required by s 8(a) of the Determination.

50 In the present case, the Committee - as it was entitled to do under s 106K(4) - used a sampling methodology which was not the subject of a Ministerial determination under s 106K(3). Instead, it used the sampling methodology which had been advised to be statistically valid by Professor Nicholls pursuant to s 106K(4) of the Act. The case of Mathews is clearly distinguishable from the present case, both on its facts and having regard to the controlling principles.

51 It was submitted by the Applicant in Mathews that the Committee's examination of 30 services in each MBS item of service under review from a list of 40 services provided to the Committee by the Director which included services that had already been examined by the Director and found to be deficient and adverse to Dr Mathews had the effect that the sample could no longer be considered to have been 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample.' His Honour did not find it necessary to determine this question and specifically left it open. However, he did indicate that there might be some suggestion that this allegation of error in the sampling process should be upheld.

52 It is important to note that, as discussed above, the Mathews case is distinguishable and that Edmonds J specifically refrained from deciding that particular question. The observation of his Honour is not binding on me. In my view, the sample used in the present case was in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The evidence is that the Commission drew a preliminary random sample and that the Director required the production of records which he examined. He concluded, for the reasons given by him in his Report, that it would be appropriate for him to refer the matter to a Committee. In examining the material and completing his Report, the Director did not decide that there was inappropriate conduct. That determination was left for the Committee to make following a hearing and having regard to the evidence adduced at that hearing. It is not correct to suggest that the Director had found that the samples had in fact given rise to inappropriate conduct. The fact that the Director examined and considered the records and forwarded them to the Committee does not affect their randomness when they were considered afresh by the Committee. The sample items retained their character as random samples and were not skewed or biased so that the Committee's decision should be considered invalid.

53 The next ground of invalidity raised relates to Professor Nicholls' memorandum addressed to Ms Goodspeed dated 5 March 2004. It is submitted that Professor Nicholls' memo demonstrates that the decision of the Committee was based on errors of law.

54 On 4 March 2004, Ms Goodspeed, who had been given the task of preparing a draft report for the Committee, sent an email to Professor Nicholls. She sought his advice as to whether it was unsafe to proceed with the proposed sampling methodology. In his reply of 5 March 2004, Professor Nicholls responded:
 
 'Re: Request of 4 March 2004 
 
 From the information supplied I note: 
 
 
 &#8226; From the 17,970 item 23 services a random sample of 84 services have been examined (with 4 services being disregarded due to no records). The Committee found that of the remaining 80 services, 69 or 86% (rounded down) were considered inappropriate. 
 
 
 
 &#8226; Applying appropriate statistical techniques it can be shown that we can be 95% confident that the true percentage of inappropriate practice lies between 86% + 8%, that is the lower 95% confident limit is 78%. This value (78%) is to be chosen as the level of inappropriate practice (rather than 86%). 
 
 
 In conclusion, it is statistically valid to accept the conclusion based on the sample of 80 item 23 services that the level of inappropriate practice will be determined as 78%. 
 
 I confirm that I am a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia Inc. as required under subsection 106K(4) of the Act.'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/49.html</AustLII>
<text>61 In the course of the hearing and the reading of evidence, there were objections to certain material prepared by Professor Nicholls concerning material said to have been before the Committee. The principal objection taken by the Applicant was that to allow such evidence would be contrary to the principle of 'judicial immunity,' as discussed in the judgments of Gaudron J in Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal [2000] HCA 49 ; (2000) 170 ALR 379 and Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal (No 2)(2000)170 ALR 575. Those decisions were concerned with the operation of s 435(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which confers on members of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("RRT") the same protection and immunity as a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the present case, s 106F(1) of the Act gives to Committee members in the performance of their duties the same protection and immunity as that given to a Justice of the High Court.

63 Her Honour held that the entire general protection and immunity of a Justice of the High Court is conferred on a member of the RRT by s 435(1), and that this immunity extends to the disclosure of any aspect of the decision-making process. In her Honour's view, the purpose of such a provision was to provide freedom of thought and independence of judgment. Her Honour found no difficulty with the proposition that, in appropriate cases, a judge may be required to disclose 'the record' on which the judge has acted. However, in her Honour's view, the production of additional material beyond the record could breach immunity: Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal [2000] HCA 49 ; (2000) 170 ALR 379 at 383.

64 In respect of several of the interrogatories at issue in Herijanto , her Honour found that answers would not disclose the decision-making process and therefore these were permitted. However, where Gaudron J considered that the nature of the interrogatories sought compulsory disclosure of aspects of the decision-making process, her Honour held that they constituted a contravention of s 435(1). The offending interrogatories were consequently set aside by her Honour.</text>

The principal objection taken by the Applicant was that to allow such evidence would be contrary to the principle of 'judicial immunity,' as discussed in the judgments of Gaudron J in Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal [2000] HCA 49 ; (2000) 170 ALR 379 and Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal (No 2)(2000)170 ALR 575. Those decisions were concerned with the operation of s 435(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which confers on members of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("RRT") the same protection and immunity as a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the present case, s 106F(1) of the Act gives to Committee members in the performance of their duties the same protection and immunity as that given to a Justice of the High Court.

65 In the later Herijanto decision, her Honour held that the protection conferred by s 435(1) extended not merely to disclosure by the individual member concerned, but the revelation, by whatever means, of any aspect of their decision-making process. It was also noted by her Honour that whether or not the privilege extended to the revelation, by whatever means, of the decision-making processes of individual members, it would not be right to order discovery to enable the plaintiffs to do indirectly what they could not do directly. Accordingly, her Honour refused the discovery application: Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal (No 2)(2000)170 ALR 575.</text>

<tocase>Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (No. 1) [2005] FCA 1061</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1061.html</AustLII>
<text>66 In Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (No. 1) [2005] FCA 1061 , Edmonds J refused an application for discovery of the file of the Committee. In that case, the Applicant submitted that the file should be disclosed on the basis that an affidavit of the Manager of the Committee Unit indicated that the Manager had reviewed the Committee file and certain statements in the affidavit were made in consequence of that review. Referring to the principles articulated by Gaudron J in the Herijanto cases , his Honour rejected the application for discovery of the Committee file .

67 In the present case, the Committee has not opposed the disclosure of the material provided in Professor Nicholl's report in respect of which the Applicant makes the objection based on judicial immunity. In my view, there are two considerations which lead me to reject the submissions of the Applicant as to the application of judicial immunity in this case.

68 The first is that the advice of Professor Nicholls and the circumstances surrounding the provision of his report have not been shown to be a part of or an aspect of the decision-making process of the Committee or any individual member. The certification by Professor Nicholls and matters relating to it were directed to the provision of advice as to whether a statistical method was valid and could be used by the Committee. In other words, the advice of Professor Nicholls provided a basis, factum or tool of analysis in respect of which the Committee was free to act if it so chose. The Committee was able to accept a methodology approved by him as being in accordance with the required procedures, but his certification of the relevant methodology could not be said to be part of the Committee's 'decision-making process' in the sense articulated by Gaudron J in the Herijanto decisions.

69 The second consideration is that Professor Nicholls cannot be considered to be a member or agent of the Committee. I do not agree with Applicant's contention that the principle of judicial immunity operates to prevent Professor Nicholls from providing copies of his report to the Court because he is effectively the Committee's agent. Professor Nicholls is an independent expert consultant of the Committee, and accordingly the evidence which is objected to is not within the immunity conferred by s 106F.

70 In addition, I do not consider that s 129 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) takes the matter further or is of any assistance to the Applicant. I do not need to decide whether the immunity can be waived in a manner similar to the way in which, for example, legal professional privilege can be waived, having regard to the public interest element that is concerned with the grant of judicial immunity. I note that Division 3 of Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act in which s 129 appears is entitled "Evidence Excluded in the Public Interest." Clearly, the evidence given by Professor Nicholls in this case is an expression of his own independent advice.

71 As a consequence of my ruling in the course of the hearing on the judicial immunity objection, counsel for the Applicant indicated that he might seek discovery of other documents in the Committee file on the basis that there had been a "waiver" of the privilege by the Commission, and that the Applicant was therefore entitled to see the whole of the file and not just simply the letter of advice from Professor Nicholls. However, this course was not pressed by the Applicant.

72 For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the challenges made to the decisions of the Director and the Professional Services Review Committee must fail.

73 Accordingly, the application is dismissed with costs.
