<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273</tocase>

<text>12 The applicant additionally seeks to rely on the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. However as Mason CJ and Deane J stated in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273, since the Convention has not been incorporated into Australian municipal law, it cannot operate as a direct source of individual rights and obligations. Nonetheless, where the provisions of the Convention are relevant to the exercise of a statutory discretion, a legitimate expectation exists that the decision-maker will act in accordance with the Convention in exercising that discretion. However as discussed above, the decision in the present case was ultimately based upon the issue as to whether the applicant satisfied certain statutory criteria as opposed to discretionary considerations, and as such the applicant could not seek to rely upon the Convention.

13 The appeal has no viable foundation must be dismissed with costs.
