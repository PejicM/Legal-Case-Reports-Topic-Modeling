<text>This is not a case where proceedings have been discontinued before trial. In such cases it is relevant to consider and determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them: South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported Federal Court 10 February 1989, Pincus J); Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201.</text>

<tocase>O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1180.html</AustLII>
<text>Where leave to discontinue is required, as in this case, O 22 r 2(3) of the Federal Court Rules 1976 (Cth) does not provide expressly for the incidence of costs. Accordingly, I approached the matter having regard to the general discretion under O 62 r 3(1) underpinned by s 43(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160 at [12] .

In this case, given the conclusion I had already reached, costs would have been ordered in favour of ASIC. There is no reason to depart from that usual result now.</text>
