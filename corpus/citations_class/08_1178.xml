<text>4 That was not a ground of challenge advanced before the learned Federal Magistrate. That in itself would not prevent a grant of leave to amend a notice of appeal in an appropriate case. In this instance, there is no evidence which would ground a claim either for actual or apprehended bias on the part of the member constituting the Tribunal in the material which comprised the record before the Federal Magistrates Court. There was no attempt to adduce further evidence, and thus no need to consider whether that exceptional course ought to be permitted. It suffices to note that the mere fact that a Tribunal chooses not to accept the claims made either in writing or orally for a protection visa does not in itself give rise to any basis for the setting aside of a Tribunal's decision on the basis of apprehended bias. More particularly, such a finding does not give rise to an objective possibility of bias, as that concept is described by the Full Court of the High Court in Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 982 at 983, para 5.

5 As a general comment, there is much force in the principal submission made on behalf of the Minister, which is that, as developed in oral argument, and as articulated in the notice of appeal, the Appellant has not engaged with the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate so as to highlight where there is error in the reasoning of that Court. It is to be remembered that the function discharged by this Court is not that of the judicial review of a decision of the Tribunal, but rather the entertaining of an appeal on articulated grounds from the Federal Magistrates Court.

6 For all that, the Minister, by his counsel, very properly undertook the exercise of detailing, having regard to the notice of appeal, why it was that there was no error in the reasoning of the learned Federal Magistrate. In so doing, the assumption was made that the Appellant's case was that the learned Magistrate had erred in not accepting that the Tribunal's decision was flawed on one or more of the bases set out in the notice of appeal. That seems to me to be a fair way to approach the disposal of this appeal. What I therefore propose to do is, in short form, to deal with each of the bases of challenge set out in the notice of appeal.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407</tocase>
<text>11 Having studied the Tribunal's reasons, the adoption of that particular passage by the learned Federal Magistrate seems to me, with respect, to be both appropriate and indeed unremarkable. In this Court, attention was rightly drawn on behalf of the Minister to an observation made by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at para 67. His Honour there observed that conclusions that an Applicant was not credible and that his claims were fabricated were findings of fact "par excellence".</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>

<text>12 It bears repeating that it is no part of the function of the Federal Magistrates Court on a judicial review application, much less that of this Court when entertaining an appeal from that Court, to review on the merits the Tribunal's decision. See Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. There is no merit in ground 1.

13 Section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 makes provision for the highlighting to an Applicant of potentially adverse "information" and for the extension of an invitation to reply in respect of that information to the Applicant. The Tribunal sought to comply with that obligation as it apprehended it in a letter dated 16 July 2007, directed to the Appellant via his authorised recipient of information for the purposes of his review application. In that letter, the Tribunal provided the following particulars of information:
 
 
 &#8226; The Tribunal has before it your business visa application of 22 January 2007 and accompanying documents, submitted in Shanghai. The documents include an approval letter from a named company dated 18 January 2007 listing you as a finance director of that company, and a flight booking for you for 5 February 2007. 
 
 
 
 &#8226; You stated on your protection visa application that as soon as you learned, in early February 2007, that you were again wanted, you went to Shanghai. Your protection visa application (and your passport) show that you obtained an Australian business visa in Shanghai on 2 February 2007, and that you departed China on 12 February 2007. 
 
 
 
 &#8226; You indicated, on your protection visa application that you had difficulties leaving China. The only detail you gave was that "a friend" helped your travel arrangements. You left China on a passport in your own name.

14 The Tribunal continued, in its letter of 16 July 2007:
 This information is relevant because it suggests you left China in an orderly fashion, and not to flee persecution. It suggests that during January 2007 you were not organising protests in a named city, but rather making arrangements for your travel to Australia. It casts doubt on your claim that you travelled to Shanghai as you got news from a 'reliable source' that you were again wanted. Instead, you appear to have lodged your business visa application in Shanghai because the opportunity arose for you to present yourself as the finance director of a company in a named place, and because you had to travel to Shanghai to collect your Australian visa once it was ready on 2 February 2007. The above information suggests that, even after your visa was ready, you did not leave China for a further 10 days" [sic].</text>
