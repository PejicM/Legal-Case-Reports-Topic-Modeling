<tocase>Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 67</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/67.html</AustLII>
<text>15 The applicant asserts that this is supported by the construction of the provision given by RD Nicholson J, at first instance, in Elliott v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 67 at [38] and [40] (cited at [18] and [19] of the applicant's submissions). The Minister noted that Elliott did not concern the issue raised in the present case. The Minister submits that the excerpts cited by the applicant do not support the applicant's submission; the applicant has omitted the final sentence of [38] which would, in part, serve to undermine the construction proffered. RD Nicholson J said at [38]:
 'The question which the Tribunal was required to answer in relation to subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) was whether the applicant had an overseas near relative with whom he had not had contact within a reasonable period before making the application. In the case of the applicant, the question was referrable to his mother and/or half-siblings.' (Emphasis added)

16 In Elliott , the applicant had claimed that he had not had contact with any of his relatives. The Tribunal was not satisfied of this. Viewed in this light, this would suggest, as the Minister contends, that the same question needed to be asked of each of the applicant's overseas near relatives. This construction is borne out by what RD Nicholson J goes on to say at [40]:
 'Approaching the reasons of the Tribunal in accordance with the injunction of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shang Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272 not to construe such reasons too finely, it is a fact that the Tribunal stated the following in the course of its reasons: 
 
 "In order to satisfy subregulation 1.15(1)(c)(ii) the visa applicant must not have had any contact with an overseas near relative within a reasonable period before making the application."
 
 "The visa applicant has claimed that he did not have any contact with either his mother or half-siblings in the United Kingdom within a reasonable period before making his application on 17 October 2002." 
 
 "Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the visa applicant had not had any social contact with his mother or half-siblings within a reasonable period before making his visa application." 
 
 On the face of these statements they support a conclusion that the Tribunal understood the question posed by subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii). In themselves they belie the contention of the applicant that the Tribunal applied the policy with disregard to the requirements of the Act.'

17 Moreover, the Minister submits that the Tribunal does not ask the correct question by asking itself whether there is an overseas near relative among the relevant three with whom the applicant has not had contact. According to the Minister, the correct question is whether the applicant has had contact with an overseas near relative; the same question must be asked of each overseas near relative. Therefore, the Minister submits, the contact the applicant had with the mother and sister both residing in Afghanistan prevented the applicant from meeting the criteria for the visa.

18 This construction, the Minister submits, is supported by the operation of s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ( Contra. applicant's submissions at [21]), which provides:
 'In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears: (a) ...

<tocase>Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCAFC 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 559</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/22.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The Minister submits that the Tribunal may refer to the Procedures Advice Manual 3, noting the observations of the Full Court in Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCAFC 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 559 at 567, [23] [24]. Although not directly referred to by the Tribunal in this instance, Procedures Advice Manual 3 provides with regard to the effect of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii):
 'CONTACT WITH ONRS IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY (INC. AUSTRALIA) 18.1 Ineligibility In regards to regulations 1.15(1)(c)(ii), an applicant is ineligible if they or their spouse (if applicable) has had contact with their ONR within a reasonable period before making the visa application. The regulation is worded so that it is up to the applicant to show that they and their spouse have not had any contact with their ONR/s.' (Emphasis in original)

22 This, the Minister submits, in particular the last line of the excerpt, would seem to support this construction.

23 The proposition that the requirement in reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) is satisfied, in the case of an applicant who has two or three overseas near relatives, if the applicant has not had any contact with one of them within the relevant period, even if he has had regular contact with the other or others during that period, would, in my view, undermine the whole basis of the 'remaining relative' concept for a Subclass 115 visa. Read in context, that is, read in the context of reg 1.15 as a whole, the basis of the concept is that the visa applicant must not have more than three overseas near relatives even if he had not had contact with any of them during the relevant period: reg 1.15(1)(d); or if he has three or a lesser number of overseas near relatives, he only satisfies the requirement of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) if he has not had contact with any of them within the relevant period.</text>

<text>19 As to the second contention, at [23] of his submissions, the applicant contends that the evidential burden on the applicant and the absence of language intending disqualification, mean that the matters at reg 1.15(a) (e) take on qualifying factors. To support this proposition the applicant cited French J (with whom Finn and Hely JJ agreed) in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Hidalgo [2005] FCAFC 192 ; (2005) 145 FCR 564 at [12] . In Hidalgo , the Court was construing reg 1.15(1)(c)(i) which provides that remaining relative visas were only available to those applicants who 'usually resided in a country, not being Australia' that was different from a country in which their overseas near relative lived. French J said at [12]:
 'In my opinion, reg 1.15(1)(c)(i) is intended to apply to the circumstance in which an applicant for the relevant visa has an overseas relative in another country. It is concerned with their geographical relationship when they both reside outside Australia. It is not a regulation which is intended to bring in, by a sidewind, a disqualifying criterion for the grant of such a visa based upon the circumstance that the applicant happens to have her only usual residence in Australia. In the event that the applicant usually resides in Australia only, then the criterion under reg 1.15(1)(c)(i) simply does not apply because the circumstances to which it is intended to apply do not arise.' (Emphasis added)

20 The Minister submits that the above passage makes clear that the applicant's contention that French J's remarks are of wholesale application to the regulation per se is untenable. First, French J was referring to reg 1.15(1)(c)(i) and secondly, the Minister submits that his Honour's observations are limited to the facts of the case to be decided.</text>
