<text>27 It may be accepted as a general statement of principle that if directions are given by a court or tribunal that have the effect of fettering cross-examination so that a witness's evidence on relevant issues cannot be properly tested, there is a denial of procedural fairness. But it must be emphasised that this proposition is subject to the discretion of the decision maker to control cross-examination so as to ensure relevance and to guard against repetition and prolixity; see R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 at 34-35; Australian Postal Commission v Hayes (1989) 87 ALR 283 at 289 per Wilcox J.</text>

<text>4 Most of the background facts, as well as the decision of Senior Member Kelly, have been set out in my judgment in matter NSD 55 of 2005, handed down contemporaneously with this judgment; see Lawrance v President, Administrative Appeal Tribunal [2006] FCA 342.

5 It is necessary to add only briefly to what I have already said about the background and the decision under appeal.

6 In her request for documents under the FOI Act dated 23 February 2004, the applicant explained that whilst she had "never been aware or conscious of having had CRS involvement in any aspect of my employment or my life", she came to believe "with hindsight" that there had been some sort of involvement.</text>

<tocase>Minh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 304</tocase>
<text>28 In Minh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 304 at 314, Weinberg J observed that the duty to act fairly may be breached if a party is not given a reasonable opportunity to make relevant submissions, to give evidence and to call witnesses. But his Honour went on to say:-
 "At the same time, however, the opportunity to make relevant submissions, to give evidence, and to call witnesses in support which must be afforded will always be qualified by a requirement that the material and arguments sought to be presented must be sufficiently relevant and significant to warrant being received."

29 The power of the AAT to control the proceeding so as to ensure compliance with these principles is found in s 33(1)(a) of the AAT Act . That subsection provides that the procedure of the AAT is, subject to the AAT Act and the Regulations and any other enactment, within the discretion of the AAT.

30 There were only two real issues in the proceeding before Senior Member Kelly. The first was whether there were documents in the possession of CRS which were the subject of the applicant's request. The second was whether CRS had taken all reasonable steps to search for such documents. The learned Senior Member was plainly entitled to control the hearing and to limit examination or cross-examination so as to ensure some semblance of relevance to the real issues.</text>
