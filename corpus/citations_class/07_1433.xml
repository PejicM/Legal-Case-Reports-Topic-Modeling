<tocase>Gregory v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 2 ; (1971) 123 CLR 547</tocase>

<text>14 The defendants submit that "if a measure of value is the amount that a person is willing to pay for something, then the offer documents themselves are key components in assessing the value of the Cambridge debentures". I do not accept that the amount one offeror is willing to pay for a debenture is, by itself, a proper measure of the value of that debenture. Rather, the value of a debenture would be its exchange value or the price that it would bring when exposed to competition. (I put to one side the situation, that sometimes arises, where it is necessary to value an item that is not marketable). The cases say that value is to be determined by reference to the amount that an hypothetical ordinary purchaser who is willing but not anxious to buy would be prepared to pay for the debenture, and an hypothetical ordinary seller who is also willing but not anxious to sell would be prepared to accept for it, assuming both parties were fully informed and had regard to all the circumstances which might affect value: see Spencer v Commonwealth [1907] HCA 70 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418, 432 and 440-441; Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494, 514; Holt v Cox (1994) 15 ACSR 313, 333-334; Gregory v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 2 ; (1971) 123 CLR 547. Where there is a regular market for a product, the market price should reflect the exchange value of a product. Where, as here, there is no regular market for a product, it is necessary to estimate the (exchange) value.</text>
