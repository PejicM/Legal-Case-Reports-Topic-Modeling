<text>7 This Court has power under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as the Court thinks appropriate. That power extends to the making of orders that are necessary to enable the Federal Court to exercise its jurisdiction effectively, or to prevent any abuse or frustration of, or interference with, its processes: see Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 (' Patrick' ), at 32-33 [35] per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, and at 61-62 [127] per Gaudron J; and Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 217-218 [10] - [12] and [15] per Gleeson CJ, at 231-232 [60] per Gaudron J, and at 241 [91] and 242-243 [93]-[94] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. The authorities establish that Courts can restrain executive action where it poses a real risk of interfering with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally: see Brambles Holdings Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1980) 32 ALR 328; Hammond v Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42 ; (1982) 152 CLR 188; and Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees &amp; Builders Labourers' Federation [1982] HCA 31 ; (1982) 152 CLR 25.</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>11 In claiming confidentiality (albeit unsuccessfully) and in making this application for an interlocutory injunction, AWB has done everything within its power to prevent the publication of the documents. It is difficult to see why, in those circumstances, the step that the Inquiry wishes to take of publishing the documents on its website would increase the risk that AWB's conduct would be regarded as effecting a waiver of privilege over other documents. Imputed waiver arises where the party claiming legal professional privilege engages in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13 [29] .

12 Secondly, the references to legal advice in the documents have essentially the same character as other disclosures that AWB has previously made to the Commission. Those disclosures have been the subject of evidence in public proceedings at the Inquiry, and are already in the public domain. It is difficult to see why the additional references in the documents to legal advice would alter the risk of waiver that AWB already confronts as a result of the prior publication of very similar material.

13 Thirdly, in the course of this case, the Commonwealth has relied upon previous occasions on which AWB has disclosed the existence and substance of legal advice to contend that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated documents. Mr Harrison, senior counsel for the Commonwealth, informed the Court that the Commonwealth does not intend to rely upon the further references to legal advice in the documents in support of its waiver arguments in these proceedings.

14 AWB argues that, even if these additional references are not to be relied upon by the Commonwealth in this case, that does not remove the risk that in another piece of litigation, at some later point, some other party will seek to rely upon these additional references to argue that AWB has thereby waived privilege over other documents. I do not think that this possible future circumstance supports AWB's contention that publication poses a real risk of interference with the processes of this Court or the administration of justice generally.

15 AWB did not base its application on any contention that the first respondent had exercised his powers improperly or for any extraneous purpose. Its application was based solely on principles of contempt of Court.

16 Turning to the balance of convenience, I am not satisfied that the publication of the documents will cause irreparable harm or any serious prejudice to AWB. In my view, the risk of prejudice to which AWB points is remote.

17 I must also take account of the public interest in the conduct of the Inquiry and the first respondent's desire to conduct further proceedings in public at which these additional documents may be the subject of evidence. This consideration outweighs the remote risk of any prejudice to AWB.</text>
