<tocase>Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236</tocase>
<text>28 Under s 501(6) a person does not pass the character test if he or she has a substantial criminal record. It is not in dispute that Mr Gilbert has a substantial criminal record. In Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236 at 246 a Full Court, by way of obiter dicta , observed that the power conferred on the Minister to cancel a visa only applies to visas that have been granted to a person. Where a visa has been granted to a person, s 501F(3) operates so that any other visa held by that person is cancelled. So when an absorbed person visa is cancelled the transitional (permanent) visa held by that person is also cancelled. However, the Full Court considered in Moore that that process could not operate in reverse. That is because, so it said, the transitional (permanent) visa is a visa which is not granted or deemed to be granted to a person but is held by a person as a result of the operation of the Transitional Regulations.

29 Contrary views to those contained in Moore in the above respect, have been expressed in Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 415 ; (2000) 97 FCR 387 (per Finkelstein J) and Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1544 (per Dowsett J).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom (2006) 228 CLR 566</tocase>
<text>41 The "criminal record" can only record charged acts where the person concerned has been found guilty. Even so, the Minister is entitled, in deciding whether or not to cancel the visa of a person who he suspects does not pass the character test, to take into account various matters in the exercise of his discretion. As counsel for the respondent submitted, once s 501(2) is engaged, the considerations relevant to the exercise of the discretion are very wide, see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom (2006) 228 CLR 566 at 606, per Heydon and Crennan JJ where their Honours said:
 
 Parliament has left it to the Minister to decide the matters which are relevant to whether a person who fails the character test should be permitted to remain in Australia. Considerations relevant to the exercise of the power depend on the nature, scope and purpose of the power, understood in its context in the Act. As Ministerial Direction No 21 makes clear, the Minister considers that two of the factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion are related to the protection of the Australian community and the expectations of the community. (Emphasis added.)

42 It was, at least, open to the Minister to take into account uncharged acts. Such matters may be relevant to the risk of Mr Gilbert re-offending in the future.

43 Having regard to the foregoing it is appropriate to order that the application is dismissed and that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding.
