<tocase>Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The principles applicable to the assessment of damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act were set out by Black CJ and Jacobson J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at [23] ff. It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in that case, save for two relevant observations.

First, in DAP Services , the Aristocrat companies claimed damages only upon one basis, namely, the value of lost sales calculated by reference to the report of a chartered accountant who attempted to calculate the loss of profits for each lost sale: see DAP Services at [30].

However, the claim for compensatory damages failed in DAP Services because the evidence did not establish that each sale by the respondents was at the expense of a new Aristocrat machine: see DAP Services at [31].

Second, it was suggested in DAP Services at [34]ff that there may have been other bases upon which damages could have been assessed. These included the possibility of finding that Aristocrat had lost some proportion of the sales made by the infringing respondents: see Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 at [8] per Emmett J.

However, these alternatives were not open in DAP Services because there was no evidence to support the assessment of damages on those bases.

In the present case, the Aristocrat companies contend that the appropriate measure of compensatory damages is the loss of profit that would have been made from the sale of second-hand or refurbished Aristocrat gaming machines by the Aristocrat companies, or the loss of profits on the sale of conversion kits. The evidence in support of that assessment was contained in the affidavits of Mr Irarrazaval and Mr Graham Ward, the Group Financial Controller of Aristocrat.

Mr Irarrazaval's evidence dealt in some detail with the market for the sale of Aristocrat new and refurbished gaming machines to countries in South America. Evidence was given as to the volume of second-hand or refurbished gaming machines supplied by the Aristocrat companies to companies in South America during 2002 to 2007, and the prices at which Aristocrat second-hand or refurbished gaming machines were supplied in the South American market.

Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence in relation to the market in a number of South American countries. In relation to Peru, Mr Irarrazaval said that notwithstanding the significant size of the gaming machine market, and the large number of Aristocrat gaming machines installed and operating across the various venues in Peru, the relevant member of the Aristocrat group of companies had difficulties selling Aristocrat gaming machines to customers between 2002 and 2006. Mr Irarrazaval attributed that difficulty to the high number of counterfeit gaming machines being sold in Peru at prices significantly below the prices at which the Aristocrat companies were able to offer genuine refurbished gaming machines.

Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence as to the prices that were obtained by the respondents for sales in South America covering the period from 2002 to 2004 in respect of gaming machines recorded on "seized invoice spreadsheets". Whilst it is true that the Aristocrat companies have not established that all of those gaming machines were counterfeit, it is relevant to record that, as Mr Irarrazaval says, the amount obtained for those machines was around $US1000 to $US1500 per machine. He observed that this is lower than the price at which the Aristocrat companies sold their refurbished gaming machines into South America at that time, which was put at between $US3500 and $US4500 per unit.

The principles upon which additional damages are awarded were discussed in DAP Services at [40]ff. It is not necessary to set out the principles in any detail. It is sufficient to say that the objectives include deterrence, and that an element of penalty is an accepted factor in the remedy. Also, the assessment of the amount to be rewarded is a somewhat imprecise exercise and the Court is to have regard, amongst other things, to the flagrancy of the infringement and the need to mark the Court's disapproval of the conduct.

In the present case, as in DAP Services, the actions of the respondents demonstrate a cynical and flagrant exploitation of the Aristocrat companies' copyright. Although the number of infringing transactions was ultimately proved to be far less than the number claimed by the Aristocrat companies, it is plain that the respondents were engaged in a commercial exercise. Their actions were plainly flagrant and undertaken for commercial gain.

The Aristocrat companies claimed that the true nature of the respondents' business was a large scale counterfeiting operation. They failed to make this good. But the statements made in the emails when considered with much of the materials seized on the Anton Piller raids show the willingness of the respondents to engage in counterfeiting when it suits their commercial purposes.

There is no need for any proportionality between the amount of compensatory damages under s 115(2) and the amount of additional damages under s 115(4): DAP Services at [45].

I am also entitled to take into account the conduct of the respondents after the acts constituting the infringement. Accordingly, I am entitled to include in my calculation of additional damages the attitude of the respondents to this litigation, in which they vehemently denied any involvement in counterfeiting.

For the reasons mentioned above, additional damages cannot be maintained against Tonita as it has not been established that Tonita was involved in any of the 54 impugned transactions.

The amount of additional damages awarded in DAP Services was $200,000 against Vidtech and Mr Parry: see DAP Services at [53] and [116].

Here, the activities were on a scale which seems to me to be larger than that which existed in DAP Services. In addition, there are three groups of respondents. I have come to the view that I ought to award an amount of $450,000 for additional damages under s 115(4) against the Global respondents, the Impact respondents and Mr Allam, jointly and severally.

Although Mr Allam was an independent contractor, he was intimately involved in the venture and there is no basis for awarding a lesser sum of additional damages against him.

Damages were also sought for infringement of trade marks, breach of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and passing off. However, these claims were pressed only to the extent that damages awarded for copyright infringement were inadequate.</text>

<tocase>Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Jain (1990) 26 FCR 53</tocase>
<text>Both Branson J, at [38], and Kenny J, at [145], referred to the decision of a Full Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Jain (1990) 26 FCR 53. There, Sheppard, Foster and Hill JJ held at 61 that a "studied and deliberate course of action" in which a respondent had decided to ignore the applicant's rights and to allow a situation to develop which he must have known would be likely to result in an infringement, amounted to an authorisation.

Jain was an authority on the question of the degree of control that was required to give rise to an authorisation prior to the enactment of s 36(1A) and s 101(1A). But as Kenny J observed at [140] and [146], that case emphasises the breadth of the concept of authorisation and that a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent an infringing act is a relevant consideration to a finding of authorisation.

The degree of control, the nature of the relationship between the parties and the question of "reasonable steps" are now enshrined in s 36(1A)(a), (b) and (c), which I am required to take into account in determining whether the claims of "authorisation" are made out.

Three separate tests have been stated. The first is the " Performing Right Society test", namely whether the director "directed or procured" the company's infringement. The second is the " Mentmore test", that is whether the director or officer "makes the tortious act his own" by deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement: see the discussion of Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [123] ff.</text>

<tocase>Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; [1938] 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>As I have said, the Aristocrat companies have the onus. Whether the standard is the balance of probabilities or the Briginshaw standard as was submitted by the respondents, there was nothing in the evidence adduced by Mr Coster which imposed any onus of proof on Global. To the extent that Global had any evidentiary onus, that was discharged by Mr Andrews' oral evidence and the documentary evidence to which I have referred.

Although I have reached an adverse view of Mr Andrews' credit, it does not follow that I would reject all of his evidence as untruthful. It seems to me that Mr Andrews' evidence of the Play King transaction was consistent with the documentary evidence and I accept it.

During the course of the hearing, the Aristocrat companies placed great weight on a bundle of business communications involving either the Global, Impact or Tonita respondents, or a combination of one or more of the groups of respondents.

Second, although there is some difference in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate to describe the standard of proof under s 140 as the Briginshaw standard, the cases all recognise that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved: Qantas v Gama at [110] and [139]; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at [30] - [36] .

Fourth, the position stated by the Full Court of the Federal Court exposes a difference of views on the question of whether the trier of fact must feel "an actual persuasion." Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ accepted that the Court must be so persuaded in Communications and Allied Services Union v ACCC at [31]. But that observation was based upon the statement of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; [1938] 60 CLR 336 at 361-362. In Qantas v Gama at [123] and [139], Branson J (with whom French and Jacobson JJ expressed general agreement) considered that the Briginshaw test has been replaced by the provisions of s 140 , and should be avoided due to its tendency to mislead.</text>

<tocase>CBS Inc v Ames Records &amp; Tapes Ltd [1982] Ch 91</tocase>
<text>The reason for the House of Lords' decision appears to be the absence of control over the actions of the purchasers and the possibility of legitimate use rather than the inevitability of infringement: see 1053-1055; see also CBS Inc v Ames Records &amp; Tapes Ltd [1982] Ch 91 at 106 (per Whitford J).

This is to be contrasted with the facts of the present case as is well illustrated by the email set out at [312]. Mr Allam was requested to provide game software and blank chips. I reject his denial that he knew the purpose to be the copying of the game software onto the chips in South America.

It is true that Mr Allam had no real ability to control what took place in South America, but there was no possibility that the blank EPROMs were to be used for a legitimate purpose. It was inevitable that the EPROMs were to be used for the purpose of infringement.

Moreover, there was other evidence which was indicative of unauthorised copying by the Tonita respondents. This was the existence of the Dataman software on the Loose HDD. Mr McKemmish's evidence that the Dataman software was operated on the Loose HDD gives rise to a very strong inference that the Tonita respondents used it to burn Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs: see [498].

When this evidence is taken into account, it makes more credible the evidence of Mr Channa that he saw Mr Allam burning EPROMs from an EPROM burning device: see [348].</text>

<text>Whilst I have not been able to conduct a visual comparison of the infringing compliance plates with the Aristocrat companies' originals, the evidence is sufficient for me to infer that the test stated by the High Court in S.W. Hart &amp; Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 472, 478 and 479 is satisfied. The Tonita respondents had prior access to the copyright works. From the material before me going to infringement of compliance plates, in particular the evidence of Mr Parsons, I infer the elements of resemblance, actual use and causal connection. The onus then passed to the Tonita respondents to rebut the inference of copying but they failed to discharge that onus: Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd [2000] UKHL 58 ; [2001] All ER 700 at 708-9.</text>

<text>It is true, as was submitted on behalf of the Aristocrat companies, that some of the explanations given by Mr Andrews were revealed under cross-examination to be unacceptable. This reflects upon Mr Andrews' credit but it does not make good the propositions for which the Aristocrat companies contend. Disbelief of a witness on his or her credit does not amount to positive evidence of the opposite of what is disbelieved: Gauci v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 87; J. D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Aust ed) at [17,600].

The data matching exercise must be considered on the basis of the quality of the evidence adduced by the Aristocrat companies, as the foundation upon which the exercise was conducted.

The question of the quality or sufficiency of the evidence raises two separate sub-issues. The first is the evidence pertaining to the OLGR records which formed the basis for the production of the "orange" and "yellow" serial numbers.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>It also follows in my view that the Aristocrat companies have failed to establish that Global knew or ought to have known of any infringement of its copyright in the components of the machines identified by Mr Coster. I will address the knowledge question in more detail when I deal with the "pattern of trade" and Jones v Dunkel submissions made by Mr Cobden.

Mr Coster's evidence was that the local regulations in Peru require games and artwork on gaming machines to be in Spanish.

He also gave evidence that, in his experience, there is a very significant problem of machines being "rebirthed" in Peru with the insertion of Spanish games and Spanish artwork.

The Aristocrat companies submitted that I was entitled to draw an inference of knowledge from the failure of Global to call Mr Birks to give evidence: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.

I reject this submission for the following reasons.

First, the rule in Jones v Dunkel only applies where a party is required to explain or contradict something: Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121 at [51] ; J.D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Aust ed, 2004) at [1215], pp 41-42.

The Aristocrat companies had the burden of proving the elements of secondary infringement. Once it appeared that the machines had been shipped from Mr Birks' premises, it was for the Aristocrat companies to establish the requisite level of knowledge on the part of Global. But absent any evidence of infringement by Mr Birks, or indeed any suggestion of such to Mr Andrews, the rule in Jones v Dunkel has no application.

Second, the rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence or to convert conjecture and suspicion into inference: Cross on Evidence at [1215], p 41. Yet this is precisely what Aristocrat seeks to do.

Third, even if the rule were applicable, the appropriate inference is that Mr Birks' evidence would not have assisted Global's case: Jones v Dunkel at 308, 312, 321.

The rule could therefore not be elevated to the level at which the Aristocrat companies sought to put it, namely to draw an inference that Mr Birks' evidence would have been damaging to Global's case.

It is true that Mr Birks swore an affidavit which was filed by Global and that a forensic decision was ultimately taken by Global not to call Mr Birks to give evidence. But the mere filing of an affidavit, and even a decision taken late in the trial not to rely on that evidence, cannot alter the effect of the three propositions which I have set out above as to the inapplicability or inutility of the rule in relation to the Play King transaction.</text>

<tocase>Morris v C. W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716</tocase>
<text>One of the obligations of a bailee is to redeliver the goods to the bailor. The nature of the duty varies according to the circumstances in which and the purpose for which the goods are delivered to the bailee: Morris v C. W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716 at 731.

In Morris v C. W. Martin , Diplock LJ at 732, and Salmon LJ at 738 observed that one of the common law duties imposed upon a bailee is not to intentionally convert the goods to his or her own use. Yet this is precisely what the Behong Agreement required Behong to do.

It may be true that Behong was contractually bound not to resell the materials in their unscrapped form, but that does not undermine the proposition that the fundamental commercial purpose of the Behong Agreement, as exemplified in the terms to which I have referred, was for Behong to collect and scrap or destroy the materials. Nothing could be further from the concept of bailment.

The evidence of the dealings between Behong and Messrs Fisher and Allam indicate knowledge on the part of the Tonita respondents that their purchases of the unscrapped materials may have amounted to a breach of contract. However, that is irrelevant to the claim for conversion. No claim of inducement of breach of contract was made.</text>

<tocase>Motor Mart Limited v Webb [1958] NZLR 773</tocase>
<text>Moreover, as Turner J observed in Motor Mart Limited v Webb [1958] NZLR 773 at 784-785, it would be a mistake to conclude that the transaction of bailment is not capable of adaptation to modern commercial circumstances. Indeed, his Honour said: 
 
 I decline to assume that, under the pressures and stresses of modern legal necessity, some new mutation may not burst into flower, of a quality to startle the author of the Institutes were he privileged to behold it.

Nevertheless, the Behong Agreement cannot be such a mutation. This is evident from the nature of the obligations entailed by the relationship of bailment.

The authorities go so far as to establish that a bailment does not necessarily impose upon a bailee the obligation of redelivering the identical object that was bailed: Motor Mart v Webb at 781; Harding v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1977] 1 NZLR 337 at 340.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/66.html</AustLII>
<text>The authorities which were analysed by the Full Courts in arriving at the conclusion stated in the second proposition included, in particular, the decisions of the High Court in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66 ; (1992) 110 ALR 449 and Rejfek v McElroy [1965] HCA 46 ; (1965) 112 CLR 517.

Fifth, where an allegation is to be proved from circumstantial evidence, it is sufficient if the circumstances raise a more probable inference in favour of the allegation. Where the allegation is a serious one, the inquiry is to take account of the requirements of s 140(2)(c) , and what was said by the High Court in Neat Holdings about the need for caution in making such a finding: Palmer v Dolman at [39], [47].

To the extent that the claims are based upon circumstantial evidence, they will not be made out unless I am satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities, taking due account of what was said in Neat Holdings.

The Aristocrat companies claim that the respondents are liable for copyright infringement, either as joint tortfeasors or on the ground that one or other of them has authorised the copyright infringement carried out by the others.

The legal principles applicable to each of these separate heads of liability have been considered in some detail by the authorities. I do not consider that there is any real dispute between the parties as to those principles, but I will refer to them briefly below.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2008/246.html</AustLII>
<text>Third, the Court of Appeal of NSW has accepted that the balance of probabilities test stated in s 140 requires the Court to reach a level of actual persuasion: Nguyen v Cosmopolitan Homes [2008] NSWCA 246 at [55] ; Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29 ; (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at [136] . However, the learned editor of Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (8 th ed, 2009) observes at [1.4.100] that: 
 
 It is difficult to see how the proposition that "actual persuasion" is required can stand under [s 140 of] the Act [...].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2005/361.html</AustLII>
<text>First, the standard of proof which is required in a civil case is the balance of probabilities, but the Court should not determine whether it is so satisfied until the final stage of the reasoning process, taking into account the matters referred to in s 140(2): Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 ; (2008) 167 FCR 537 at [110] and [139]; Palmer v Dolman [2005] NSWCA 361 at [40] - [41] .

Fifth, where an allegation is to be proved from circumstantial evidence, it is sufficient if the circumstances raise a more probable inference in favour of the allegation. Where the allegation is a serious one, the inquiry is to take account of the requirements of s 140(2)(c) , and what was said by the High Court in Neat Holdings about the need for caution in making such a finding: Palmer v Dolman at [39], [47].

Sixth, it is sufficient if the circumstances give rise to a reasonable and definite inference; but if they produce conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a matter of conjecture, the allegation is not proved: Palmer v Dolman at [35], [36], [41]; Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd (1951) 217 ALR 1 at 5; Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19 ; (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358 and other High Court authorities cited in Palmer v Dolman at [36]; see also The Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278 at [34] .</text>

<tocase>Papakosmas v the Queen [1999] HCA 37 ; (1999) 196 CLR 297</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/37.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Cobden's fourth and fifth points related to the respondents' argument under s 135 of the Evidence Act . In his fourth submission, Mr Cobden drew the Court's attention to the test of unfair prejudice under s 135 , as defined by Papakosmas v the Queen [1999] HCA 37 ; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325, which envisaged a danger that the fact finder may use the evidence on an improper, perhaps emotional, basis; that is on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case. Mr Cobden argued that the respondents had failed to clearly articulate the basis upon which s 135 had been invoked, and in any case, the evidence objected to did not meet the test set out in Papakosmas.

Finally, Mr Cobden rejected the analogy drawn by the respondents between the role of the independent computer expert and that of the independent solicitor in the carrying out of Anton Piller orders. He argued that the independent computer expert is not an officer of the Court and is therefore not under the same obligations as the independent solicitor. He also referred to several Federal Court practice directions and practice notes in which the role of the independent solicitor is significantly more regulated than that of the independent computer expert. 
 9.5.5.1.3 ADMISSIBILITY OF MR MCKEMMISH'S EVIDENCE

The view that I came to after hearing the submissions of the parties was that, whilst it is undesirable for a person who has occupied the role of an independent expert for the purpose of an Anton Piller order to then give evidence as an expert witness, I did not consider that the submissions that had been put before me demonstrated that it was an abuse of process. Moreover, the undesirability of Mr McKemmish giving evidence could have been pointed to at any time after 20 December 2007 but was not, either in correspondence between the parties or in directions hearings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/69.html</AustLII>
<text>First, the standard of proof which is required in a civil case is the balance of probabilities, but the Court should not determine whether it is so satisfied until the final stage of the reasoning process, taking into account the matters referred to in s 140(2): Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 ; (2008) 167 FCR 537 at [110] and [139]; Palmer v Dolman [2005] NSWCA 361 at [40] - [41] .

Second, although there is some difference in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate to describe the standard of proof under s 140 as the Briginshaw standard, the cases all recognise that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved: Qantas v Gama at [110] and [139]; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at [30] - [36] .

Fourth, the position stated by the Full Court of the Federal Court exposes a difference of views on the question of whether the trier of fact must feel "an actual persuasion." Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ accepted that the Court must be so persuaded in Communications and Allied Services Union v ACCC at [31]. But that observation was based upon the statement of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; [1938] 60 CLR 336 at 361-362. In Qantas v Gama at [123] and [139], Branson J (with whom French and Jacobson JJ expressed general agreement) considered that the Briginshaw test has been replaced by the provisions of s 140 , and should be avoided due to its tendency to mislead.</text>

<tocase>Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88</tocase>
<text>In determining whether an alleged "infringer" has the requisite knowledge under s 38 of the Copyright Act , regard may be had to the "knowledge, capacity and circumstances of the particular defendant": Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 91 per Burchett J; see also at 97 per Tamberlin J, at 104 per Lehane J.

Raben Footwear was concerned with the construction and effect of ss 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act which contain the same element of knowledge as s 38 , namely "knew or ought reasonably to have known". Accordingly, the same approach may be adopted on this question in the present case.

Mr Cobden's submission that knowledge could be inferred from Global's "pattern of trade" rested upon the fact that the Play King transaction was the twelfth in the list of 54 transactions identified by the Aristocrat companies.

However, in my view, this submission must be rejected for the following reasons.

Third, there was no evidence in the present case of the type which resulted in a finding of constructive knowledge in Raben Footwear . In that case, the importer made inquiries from the manufacturer as to whether all copyright conditions had been met but received only a guarded and limited assurance: see Raben Footwear at 92.</text>

<text>Three separate tests have been stated. The first is the " Performing Right Society test", namely whether the director "directed or procured" the company's infringement. The second is the " Mentmore test", that is whether the director or officer "makes the tortious act his own" by deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement: see the discussion of Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [123] ff.

The third test was formulated by Finkelstein J in Root Quality at [146]. The test is that the director's conduct is such that: 
 
 ... he was so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act that it is just that he should be rendered liable.</text>

<text>The claim against the Tonita respondents is that they were engaged by the Global/Impact Joint Venture for reward, to supply services and to procure parts and equipment for the purposes of the joint venture and that they are "so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act[s], that it is just that [they] should be rendered liable": Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 220 ALR 1 at [434] ; cf Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 at [1] , [74], [161].

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1975/26.html</AustLII>
<text>In Cooper at [136], Kenny J observed that s 101(1A) of the Copyright Act (which corresponds to the current s 36(1A)) is premised on the concept of "authorisation" developed by the High Court in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1.

Moorehouse is authority for the proposition that "authorisation" means "sanction, approve, countenance"; express or formal permission is not required: per Gibbs J at 12-13; per Jacobs J at 20-21.

Gibbs J said at 13: 
 
 ... a person who has under his control the means by which an infringement of copyright may be committed such as a photocopying machine and who makes it available to other persons, knowing, or having reason to suspect, that it is likely to be used for the purpose of committing an infringement, and omitting to take reasonable steps to limit its use to legitimate purposes, would authorize any infringement that resulted from its use.

Kenny J also referred in Cooper to the observations of Gummow J in WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited (1987) 17 FCR 274 at 285-286. 
Gummow J there pointed to the broad concept of "authorisation" accepted by the High Court in Moorhouse.</text>

<text>Kenny J also referred in Cooper to the observations of Gummow J in WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited (1987) 17 FCR 274 at 285-286. 
Gummow J there pointed to the broad concept of "authorisation" accepted by the High Court in Moorhouse.

As Gummow J explained in WEA International at 283, infringement of copyright statutes are considered tortious, so as to make applicable the common law principles of liability of joint tortfeasors.

It is not sufficient to establish a claim of joint liability that two or more persons assisted or concurred in or contributed to a tortious act; what is required is that there be "some common design": WEA at 283.

In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1 at [135] , Tamberlin J pointed out that it follows from the remarks of Gummow J in WEA International that: 
 
 ... there must be something in the nature of concerted action or agreed common action. It is not necessary that there must be an explicitly mapped out plan with the primary offenders. Tacit agreement between the parties is sufficient ... .

In WEA International at 283, Gummow J pointed out that where the infringer is a corporation, questions often arise as to the degree of involvement on the part of directors necessary for them to be rendered personally liable. He observed that this question is not answered by the principles which govern "authorisation" and joint tortfeasance. Rather, recourse is to be had to the authorities which explain the circumstances in which a director or officer will be personally liable for the torts of the corporation.

It is those authorities which prompted Kenny J to say in Cooper at [160] that the law concerning the liability of directors and officers for corporate wrongdoing is unclear.

As Kenny J said in Cooper at [161], no Full Court has settled which of the tests is correct. However, I do not need to consider the question because, in my view, it is essential to recognise that the debate in the authorities as to the test to be applied to the liability of directors or officers for the wrongs of the corporation is a different question from that which applies to the question of liability for "authorisation" or joint tortfeasance. This was what Gummow J pointed out in WEA International at 283.

Subject to the observations I have made about Mr Channa, it seemed to me that the witnesses called by the Aristocrat companies were, generally speaking, truthful. They made concessions where appropriate and, apart from specific matters to which I have referred in the course of these reasons, I accept their evidence.

The respondents suggested that Mr Juan Pablo Irarrazaval, the General Business Manager of Latin America for ATI, was not a witness of truth. Mr Irarrazaval's evidence dealt principally with the market for gaming machines, including second hand machines, in South America.</text>
