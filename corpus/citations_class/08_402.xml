CONSIDERATION 
 The Declarations Sought

As to the first of the above, I am with some hesitation prepared to make the orders proposed. On the material before me only Mr Fields has been shown to have been engaged in the conduct founding the contravention; the company has less than 10 employees; and there is no evidence as to the respective responsibilities of those employees such as to permit a judgment to be made as to the utility of making the relatively elaborate orders proposed. Nonetheless, because Hobie has consented to what is proposed; because the orders, in intent at least, have both preventative and educational purposes and this is reflected in their design: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Danoz Direct Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 881 at [267] ; and because the programme is one to be tailored to Hobie's circumstances (notwithstanding the reference to the Australian Standard on Compliance Programs AS3806: cf Econovite at [17]), I am prepared to make the proposed compliance programme orders.</text>

CONSIDERATION 
 The Declarations Sought

I have referred already to the requirements of s 76(1) and to the considerations it includes amongst matters relevant for the Court to have regard to in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty. I need not repeat them. Additionally, a considerable body of authority has enlarged upon the principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties. Those principles were helpfully distilled by Kenny J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 at [16] . Her Honour there said: 
 "The relevant principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties are discussed in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [60] - [75] ; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,151-52, 154; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-295; J McPhee &amp; Son (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 ; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] - [58] . These authorities indicate that further relevant matters include: 

 
 (a) the size of the contravening company; 

 
 (b) the degree of power the company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; 

 
 (c) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate, or covert; 

 
 (d) the period over which the conduct occurred; 

 
 (e) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct; 

 
 (f) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; 

 
 (g) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and discipline, or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and 

 
 (h) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.

Before analysing the circumstances revealed in this matter in light of the considerations and principles referred to in s 76(1) and in the above extract, it is appropriate to note the observations of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods . Having referred to the "unity" in the case law affirming the public interest in the promotion of settlements, especially in this area where litigation is likely to be very lengthy, their Honours observed (at 298-299): 
 "We agree with the statement made in several of the cases cited that it is not actually useful to investigate whether, unaided by the agreement of the parties, we would have arrived at the very figure they propose. The question is not that; it is simply whether, in the performance of the Court's duty under s 76 , this particular penalty, proposed with the consent of the corporation involved and of the Commission, is one that the Court should determine to be appropriate."

In considering the appropriateness of the proposed quantum of pecuniary penalty it is necessary to have regard to the various considerations to which I have referred above and to which I now turn. (i) The nature and extent of the contravening conduct and the circumstances in which it took place: s 76(1)

The contravening conduct was born of Mr Fields' decision in August 2004 and was thereafter implemented in all of its dealership agreements until revoked at the end of 2007. It was directed at all of Hobie's sail boat and kayak dealers across Australia. It was the product of the unilateral action of Mr Fields which was taken without legal advice. Its documentary expression was clear and unequivocal in its purport: Hobie did not want its dealers to discount Hobie products. (ii) The amount of loss or damage occasioned: s 76(1)

While the parties have provided me with a list of the pecuniary penalties imposed in cases dealing solely with s 48 contraventions for the period 1996 to 2007, I would have to say that "the parity principle" has yielded little by way of direct assistance. Such is not uncommon in cases concerned with TP Act contraventions: cf the observations of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods at 295.</text>

<text>It is unnecessary for me to rehearse the principles governing the award of declaratory relief particularly in cases of public interest such as the present; see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329. I am satisfied that there is utility in making the declarations both to publicise the types of conduct that can give rise to contravention of s 48 and also to provide the basis for the orders by way of injunction and pecuniary penalty. I equally am satisfied with the form in which the declaratory orders have been cast. Injunctive Relief</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/474.html</AustLII>
<text>The injunctions sought clearly fall within the requirements of s 80 of the Act. They relate directly to the contraventions found to have occurred and against which injunctive relief can be granted: cf ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 267. Further they have been formulated with sufficient precision so as to be capable of being complied with without the continual supervision of the Court. I am satisfied they are consistent with the public interest in the matter. Notwithstanding that Hobie has ceased to engage in contravening conduct, it nonetheless continues to wholesale Hobie products within Australia. The three year duration of the injunction parallels the proposed order relating to the compliance programme and will assist in preventing a recurrence of contravening conduct notwithstanding that such a recurrence is not now reasonably to be anticipated: cf s 80(4)(a). The Proposed s 86C Orders

Two distinct species of order are sought under this section. The first, which embodies a number of interlocking orders, requires the establishment and implementation of a trade practices compliance programme which is to be maintained for three years and relatedly imposes periodic reporting obligations to the ACCC. The second would require Hobie to provide information to all of its dealers in letter format concerning this proceeding and its outcome in terms annexed to the proposed consent order.</text>

<text>No attempt has been made to quantify loss or damage caused by Hobie's conduct either to consumers or to its dealers. This said, I do not consider the absence of such evidence in the circumstances to be either a mitigating or an aggravating factor: cf Trade Practices Commission v ICI Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115 at 119.

<text>Though Hobie is a significant participant in the recreational watercraft market I am prepared to assume for present purposes that such was the market and has a well recognised brand and high quality products, it is only a small to medium enterprise. Nonetheless, the evidence indicates it has substantial and growing revenue and net profits. There is no evidence of its market power or of the commercial impact of its conduct on the market. Even if that impact (if measurable with any precision at all) was slight, it would be no less blameworthy for that reason: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 152 ; (2005) 215 ALR 482 at [81] . (v) Was the conduct systematic, deliberate or covert?

The decision taken by Mr Fields and its implementation was intentional and purposive but it involved no knowing (or deliberate) contravention of the Act. It was systematic in the sense that there was no differentiation between dealers, but it was not covert in that on the evidence before me it simply cannot be said that it did other than represent Hobie's terms of trade with any prospective dealer. (vi) The period over which the conduct occurred

In the case of Glascraft, the conduct commenced in August 2004 and ceased on the termination of Glascraft's relationship with Hobie on 25 August 2006 for reasons unrelated to Hobie's price/advertising requirements. In relation to all other dealers, the only conduct relied upon occurred between September 2005 and September 2006. (vii) The involvement of senior management</text>

<text>In determining whether the proposed pecuniary penalty is appropriate, it is of course important to recognise that the sum agreed represents a settlement between the parties: cf Trade Practices Commission v Milreis Pty Ltd (No 2) [1978] FCA 20 ; (1978) 32 FLR 234 at 243. However, it is also important to acknowledge the deterrent function, specific and general, of such a penalty. As Goldberg J observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] : 
 "The penalty imposed must be substantial enough that the party realises the seriousness of its conduct and is not inclined to repeat such conduct. Obviously the sum required to achieve this object will be larger where the Court is setting a penalty for a company with vast resources. However, as specific deterrence is only one element and general deterrence must also be achieved, consideration of the party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention."</text>
