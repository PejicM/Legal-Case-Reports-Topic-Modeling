<tocase>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 56</tocase>
<text>116 Because I am of opinion that Senator Ellison's s 16(1) notice was invalid and that Mr Tervonen's continued detention after 18 August 2006 was unlawful (there having been no application to a magistrate for an extension of the detention under s 17(2)), it is appropriate to grant a declaration to the effect that after 18 August 2006 Mr Tervonen was not on remand under s 15. His liberty was interfered with for a considerable time without lawful authority: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-582 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; cf: SZFDE v Minister for Immigration (2007) 237 ALR 64 at 70 [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</text>

<tocase>Andrews v Howell [1941] HCA 20 ; (1941) 65 CLR 255</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1941/20.html</AustLII>
<text>84 The principle upon which those decisions proceeded was an application of provisions such as ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). These evince a legislative intention to preserve the validity of so much of an enactment, action or instrument authorised by law as would be supported by use of the power relied upon, notwithstanding that some other part of the enactment, action or instrument in question has been found to be beyond the power relied upon for its making. Thus, s 46(2) provides that if any instrument, such as a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act , made pursuant to an enactment would be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, '... it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power'. A search warrant has been held to be such an instrument, as McHugh JA pointed out in Peters 16 NSWLR at 41E. Accordingly, he held that the search warrants in that case were to be read and construed, to the extent that they could be read, as valid instruments. He applied what Dixon J had said in Andrews v Howell [1941] HCA 20 ; (1941) 65 CLR 255 at 281 in relation to ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act . A notice under s 16 of the Act is also such an instrument.

85 In Andrews 65 CLR at 281 Dixon J said such provisions imposed a burden upon those attacking an entire regulation, part of which was bad, to establish that if the regulation were confined within the limits of the power, the result would be, not a partial application of the law, but a different provision. Alternatively, the attacker had to establish that it was the intention of the Act or Regulation which authorised the making of an instrument, that unless the instrument received its full intended operation, it should not operate at all.

185 Mere proof of the absence of power to make part of a notice would not necessarily result in the balance being invalid. This is because s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act deems the balance to be valid unless, as Dixon J explained in Andrews v Howell 65 CLR at 281, Mr Tervonen showed that the balance was not intended to operate in the absence of the invalid portions.</text>

<tocase>Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth (The Bank Nationalisation Case) [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1948/7.html</AustLII>
<text>86 Later, in Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth (The Bank Nationalisation Case) [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1 at 370-371 Dixon J expanded upon the principles applicable to the construction of legislation or actions done under the authority of legislation where provisions such as ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) displaced the common law doctrine of severance. He explained that there was a common law presumption that the legislature intended its will on any particular matter as expressed in a statute to operate in its entirety and had no intention that something less should be the law (76 CLR at 371; see too The King v Poole; Ex parte Henry [No 2] [1939] HCA 19 ; (1939) 61 CLR 634 at 651 per Dixon J; Victoria v The Commonwealth (The Industrial Relations Act Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1996) 187 CLR 416 at 502 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ; Harrington v Lowe [1996] HCA 8 ; (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 326 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ). In the Bank Nationalisation Case 76 CLR at 371 Dixon J discussed ss 15A and the then form of s 46(b) (cp now: s 46(2)) of the Acts Interpretation Act . He said that in applying those provisions:
 
 '... the courts have insisted that a provision, though in itself unobjectionable constitutionally, must share the fate of so much of the statute, regulation or order as is found to be invalid, once it appears that the rejection of the invalid part would mean that the otherwise unobjectionable provision would operate differently upon the persons, matters or things falling under it or in some other way would produce a different result. This consideration supplies a strong logical ground for holding provisions to be inseverable, whether the prima-facie presumption be in favour or against severability. It is important where there is no statutory clause like s. 15A and it is important in using s. 15A. For the inference in such a case is strong that provisions so associated form an entire law and that no legislative intention existed that anything less should operate as a law. 
 
 Further, where severance would produce a result upon the persons and matters affected different from that which the entire enactment would have produced upon them, had it been valid, it might be said with justice that unless the legislature had specifically assented to that result, contingently on the failure of its primary intent, it could not amount to a law.'

125 When he signed the s 16 notice, Senator Johnston was acting in a public office. Under the administrative arrangements order of 21 September 2006 and the division of portfolio responsibilities agreed between the previous Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Customs, the latter had portfolio responsibility for extradition. Senator Johnston's act of signing the s 16 notice is evidence of his having been appointed as a Minister of State with responsibility for administering s 16 of the Act: Cassell v The Queen [2000] HCA 8 ; (2000) 201 CLR 189 at 193-194 [17] - [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ citing R v Brewer [1942] HCA 33 ; (1942) 66 CLR 535 at 548 per Latham CJ and McTiernan J.

126 The Extradition Act refers to the Attorney-General by name. He or she is thus a 'particular minister' within the meaning of s 19A(1)(ab) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 . In addition, s 19A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that where a provision of a statute refers to a particular minister, then unless the contrary intention appears, where two or more ministers administer the provision, any one of them is referred to as administering it (see: s 19A(1)(a) and (b)).

127 There is no contrary intention in the Extradition Act to prevent a reference to the Attorney-General also being a reference to another minister administering, with the Attorney-General, that Act or the Attorney-General's Department of State. Section 19A(1)(a)(i) of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that where different ministers administer a provision in respect of different matters, and if two or more of those ministers administer it in respect of the relevant matter, any of the Ministers may do so. And, s 19A(1)(b) provides that if s 19A(1)(a) does not apply, and for the time being two or more ministers administer the provision, any one of those ministers may do so.

209 Is it possible, as the Minister contended, to sever the invalid portions of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice under s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act ? That provides, as explained above, that the notice is to be taken to be valid '... to the extent to which it is not in excess of ...' the power to make it. However, Dixon J explained in the Bank Nationalisation Case 76 CLR at 371 that the statutory presumption would be displaced if rejection or severance of the invalid part would mean that the otherwise unobjectionable portion would operate differently on Mr Tervonen or in some other way produce a different result.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>187 In these proceedings, the civil onus of proof on the balance of probabilities applies under s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). That requires the Court to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the occurrence or existence of a fact. The Court makes such a finding based on its reasonable satisfaction that the allegation has been established by the evidence, as Dixon J explained in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-363; see too Cassell 201 CLR at 193 [18] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

188 While Mr Tervonen has the onus of establishing his case, the Minister has gone into evidence by adducing part, and withholding part, of the material before him. The Minister consciously waived privilege on portions of that material on a number of occasions during the hearing. Mr Tervonen could not lead evidence of what remained in the privileged material which the Minister chose not to put before the Court. However, that material which the Minister did choose to put before the Court leaves uncertain whether he addressed the correct question, namely whether the whole of the material enabled him to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) on the paragraph in the notice, or at least so many of them as might have been valid, had he turned his mind to them.</text>

<text>89 In Williams 157 FCR at 296 [40] the Full Court observed that cases such a Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-276, Avon Downs v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J and Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119 per Gibbs J identified two relevant principles upon which the Court may examine, on judicial review, the validity of a notice under s 16 of the Extradition Act . They said that the Court could examine whether the decision-maker had or had not taken relevant, and only relevant, matters into account. If that examination resulted in a conclusion that the material relied on by the Minister was open to be considered, '... there is a further, strictly limited but nevertheless potentially available, basis for review which focuses upon the outcome of the decision-making process'. That basis involved whether the decision-maker acted in good faith and had not acted merely arbitrarily or capriciously: Buck 135 CLR at 118-119 per Gibbs J.</text>

<text>97 In Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15 ; (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 442-443 Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ rejected an argument concerning the severability of a warrant that had been issued by a judge whom, they held, had misapprehended the power which the statute conferred. Their Honours held that the judge had purported to exercise a power different from the power reposed in him.

100 The filter which the Parliament intended be applied to extradition requests under s 16 was the formation of a genuine and real opinion by the Attorney-General, or other Minister exercising the power to give a notice under s 16(1). A notice under s 16 provides a lawful authorisation for the continuing detention of a person pursuant to the operation of s 17 of the Act. The Court should not impute to the Parliament an intention to authorise interference with the fundamental right to liberty where it does not appear that the Attorney-General or Minister actually turned his or her mind to the question s 16(2) requires be addressed: Coco 179 CLR at 537; see too Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ.</text>

<tocase>Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31</tocase>
<text>57 This passage highlights the necessity that the facts must be stated in such a way that the Minister can be satisfied that the particular conduct, being acts or omissions of the person whose extradition is sought, would have been sufficient to constitute an extradition offence in relation to Australia. Dixon J explained that a prosecutor must identify not only the legal nature of the offence with which a defendant is charged, but also the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge: Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 489-490; see too John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42 ; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 520-521 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; see Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50].

<tocase>Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/35.html</AustLII>
<text>38 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 540 Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word 'accused' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act, noting:
 
 'It is sufficient to say that, in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s 6(a)(i) of the Act, it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own.'

39 The Attorney-General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law: Williams 157 FCR at 298 [49]. Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s 6(a)(i) and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it (as the decision of the Full Court, which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; 185 CLR 528, illustrates). For this reason s 16(2)(a)(i) is framed so that the Attorney-General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person.

42 Each warrant, on its face, was termed a 'warrant'. It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence. The Minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant, issued by a Finnish Court, in force, for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s 6(a)(i). While other persons may not have formed the same view, having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia, to which Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer 185 CLR at 540, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s 6(a)(i).

43 Senator Johnston had Finland's request for extradition before him. Finland stated there that it sought Mr Tervonen's extradition 'on the basis of the offences detailed in the appended warrants for arrest, for pre-trial investigation and prosecution'. Finland provided supplementary information dated 14 August 2006 in support of the request for extradition. That was also before Senator Johnston. It stated that 'Tervonen's offences are white-collar crime of which it is very hard to get unambiguous evidence and for which trials many times take weeks. At this stage of the procedure and investigations the information provided is as detailed as possible'.

44 This material provided an additional basis why it was open to Senator Johnston to form the opinion that Mr Tervonen was an extraditable person under s 16(2)(a)(i). I am of opinion that it was open to him to have formed that opinion.</text>

<tocase>Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 1016 ; (1999) 92 FCR 575</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1016.html</AustLII>
<text>108 In order to determine whether relief would be futile for this reason, it is necessary to examine the consequence of any finding that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly or partly invalid. In Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 1016 ; (1999) 92 FCR 575 at 578 [13] Wilcox, Whitlam and Moore JJ held that once a notice under s 16 was given, it could not be withdrawn. In arriving at that result they relied upon the existence of the Attorney-General's power under s 17(1) to cause a person's remand to cease after a s 16 notice had been issued in the event that the Attorney-General did not wish that proceedings under s 19 commence ( Dutton 92 FCR at 578 [12]).

186 But the problem here is different. It is clear that Senator Johnston intended to make an amendment to the number of offences for which Mr Tervonen could be eligible for extradition to Finland by adding the 7 offences the subject of pars (57) and (58). However, the selective revelation of his legal advice leaves an open question as to what power Senator Johnston actually exercised. I infer that Senator Johnston did not intend wholly to replace Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. Had that been his intention he would have not have headed the notice as ' Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request '. Rather he would have had to state that a new notice was being given because the old one was wholly invalid. That would reflect the result of the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Dutton 92 FCR at 578 [12]-[13], that once a (valid) s 16 notice has been issued, it cannot be withdrawn.</text>

<tocase>Foster v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394</tocase>
<text>45 In submissions, the Minister pointed out that the material presented to Senator Ellison for his consideration accorded with what, in Foster v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394, Cooper J had outlined was appropriate to be before him to form the opinions required by s 16.

46 However, in Williams at 157 FCR at 296 [42], the Full Court held that Cooper J's approach was incorrect. They held that s 16(2)(a)(ii) of the Act required the Minister to have before him or her a statement of what was alleged to have been actually done or omitted, not a mere restatement of the charge in respect of which extradition was sought: Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], 298 [49]. In that case the material before the Minister had not included a statement of the elements of the offence in the extradition country. Gyles, Allsop and Buchanan JJ said ( Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50]):
 
 'The opinion which must be held by the Attorney General (or the responsible Minister) under s 16(2)(a)(ii) must relate to, and be based on, actual conduct said to constitute, in a factual sense, the commission of an identified offence. In the present case there was no information before the Minister to furnish that knowledge. Accordingly, the Minister was not in a position to form an opinion about Mr Williams' conduct, whether in reliance on advice or personally, so as to conclude that the requirements of s 16(2)(a)(ii) were met. As a result the opinion was not validly formed.'

99 While I have found that Senator Ellison erred in his approach, that error was understandable. I am not intending to criticise him in these reasons. He did not have the benefit of the decision, given months later, in Williams 157 FCR 286, but he acted on the then state of the law as interpreted by Cooper J in Foster 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/26.html</AustLII>
<text>88 It is important to bear in mind that in determining whether a notice given by the Attorney-General or Minister is wholly or partly valid for the purposes of s 16 of the Extradition Act , one of the significant effects of the notice is that it will authorise the detention in custody of the person who is its subject: Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ. In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ noted that a search warrant authorised an invasion of premises without the consent of the persons in lawful possession or occupation. They said that the validity of such a warrant was necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the Court noted that the legislature had sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions to his privacy and property. They noted that in enacting the section authorising the issue of search warrants, the Queensland legislature had given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. However, the Court pointed out that the common law had long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions. They then discussed the exceptions which many State and Commonwealth statutes had made to the common law position. They said ( George 170 CLR at 110-111):
 
 'Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation.'

94 In George v Rockett 170 CLR at 111 the Court considered the function of a justice in issuing a search warrant. The terms of the statute were that it had to 'appear to the justice' that certain conditions existed. The Court held that this imposed on the decision-maker the duty of satisfying himself or herself that the conditions for the issue of the warrant were fulfilled.</text>

<tocase>Giorgianni v The Queen [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/29.html</AustLII>
<text>160 The only act or omission expressly referred to by the CDPP as alleged against Mr Tervonen was contained in the single sentence that he 'was involved in a scheme with a number of other persons'. The CDPP's advice did not provide any detail as to how it could be found that Mr Tervonen was aware of all the material ingredients of the underlying conduct in relation to each of the balance of the offences in warrant 5 so as to attract the liability of a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of the principal offences: Giorgianni v The Queen [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473.

161 However, the primary material provided by Finland and provided to Senator Johnston included a number of acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen which the Finnish authorities considered gave rise to him being suspected with probable cause of having committed the offences. That material is capable of showing that Mr Tervonen had an involvement in establishing Yellow Light Invest Oy so that it could seek information through a remote login from the National Land Survey of Finland. And, the material suggests, as I have found, that Mr Tervonen may have been involved in procuring Yellow Light Invest Oy's registration or continuing existence by falsely representing to Finnish authorities that Ms Lindholm had consented to act as and was the auditor of that company.

162 In addition, the document found on Mr Tervonen's computer with Yellow Light Invest Oy's articles of incorporation and Ms Lindholm's identity details included the names of some missing persons and the statement that some of those persons could be buyers provided that they had not been declared dead. However, in contrast to the suggestion in that suspicious document, the scheme of the fraud alleged against Mr Tervonen involved Mr S&ouml;derqvist, a real person, becoming registered as the purchaser and applying for a loan in his own name. This was a different scheme to one involving fictitious purchasers. The only further concrete link between Mr Tervonen and any of the frauds in warrant 5 was the material seized from Ms Fallenborg's apartment, being the 59,000 euros in the envelope and the SMS card with Mr Raappana's contact details.

166 I am of opinion that this material is inadequate to support a prima facie case of any contravention of a law in Australia that is equivalent to any of the Finnish offences in warrant 5 other than those in relation to Ms Lindholm to which I have referred. As the CDPP summarised, Mr Tervonen was alleged to be 'involved' in the commission of various offences as an accessory. Here, the material in support of the charges in warrant 5 contains no sufficient link to Mr Tervonen in respect of knowledge on his part of all of the essential facts which constituted each of the multiple offences: Giorgianni 156 CLR at 503, 506 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ.

167 There is no explanation of how Mr Tervonen, when he was in jail between April and August 2004, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the activities of any of Messrs Siira, Raappana or S&ouml;derqvist. In order to establish Mr Tervonen's liability as a secondary offender in Australia, it was necessary for Senator Johnston to have before him identified conduct of Mr Tervonen which showed his intentional participation in each offence, with knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up that offence: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 667 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ applying Giorgianni [1985] HCA 29 ; 156 CLR 473. It is here that the material provided by Finland fails to provide a substantive link between the conduct alleged and how Mr Tervonen could be found to have been a secondary offender under the law of New South Wales. This deficiency in the material relied on is accentuated in respect of those offences which occurred while he was in jail between April and August 2004.</text>

<text>55 There may be differences between Finnish law and Australian law as to duplicity in bringing criminal charges: see Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467. However, in relation to an equivalent Australian offence for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii) it was essential for the material before Senator Ellison to identify particular conduct of Mr Tervonen or its equivalent, which would have constituted, without duplicity, an offence here. The particular acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen in placing an order needed to be identified, together with the basis on which that conduct could have amounted to the obtaining of a valuable or financial advantage by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

56 However, there was a lack of any particularity in the material on which Senator Ellison was asked to form an opinion that s 178BA of the Crimes Act would have been contravened had Mr Tervonen engaged in the same or equivalent conduct in New South Wales. In a broad way, the CDPP's summary suggested a connection between Mr Tervonen and others in misleading third parties. But, the CDPP did not set out who lacked an intention or ability to pay for the goods, or what Mr Tervonen's role was in relation to the formation of that intention. Given that it is implicit in the CDPP's summary that some goods were either actually paid for or no loss was suffered as a result of the order, there may have been a real issue about the proof of any preliminary intention not to pay in a particular instance and whether a particular company or companies was deceived into supplying goods. A company that was ultimately paid in full for goods it sold or which never delivered goods would hardly have conferred a financial advantage on the recipient by means of the deception. As Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 487:
 
 'Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge. For, except to prove intent or system and to exclude accident or mistake, evidence that accused persons committed other like offences is seldom relevant to the issue of guilt. But, if the present case fell within the prima facie rule, plainly to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law, and the fact that each satisfied the description contained in the complaint could afford no justification for such a breach of so important a rule.'

57 This passage highlights the necessity that the facts must be stated in such a way that the Minister can be satisfied that the particular conduct, being acts or omissions of the person whose extradition is sought, would have been sufficient to constitute an extradition offence in relation to Australia. Dixon J explained that a prosecutor must identify not only the legal nature of the offence with which a defendant is charged, but also the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge: Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 489-490; see too John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42 ; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 520-521 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; see Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50]. The position is similar in respect of European arrest warrants: Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31 at 52 [48] per Lord Hope of Craighead with whom the rest of the House agreed on this issue: see at 39 [2], 58-59 [71], 59 [72], 61 [82].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>201 Senator Johnston did not give evidence as to what he took into account or what he addressed. He could have done so, notwithstanding that for a Minister to give evidence would have been unusual. Such evidence may have clarified what Senator Johnston did. A busy Minister may have some difficulty, even after only one or two months, in recalling precisely what decision-making process he or she undertook in a portfolio requiring a number of individual decisions on a daily basis. I infer that Senator Johnston could not have clarified the actual question he addressed in signing the s 16 notice by any evidence he may have given: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.

202 The material provided by Finland in support of its extradition request covered over 270 pages. In addition to that material, the CDPP's advice was a further 22 pages long and the ministerial briefing papers comprised over 20 more pages. It is a difficult task to analyse all of that material and form a view in respect of each of the items in Senator Johnston's s 16 notice. There was no attempt in the material before the Minister to correlate paragraphs in the then draft s 16 notice with any portion of the vast amount of documentary material before him. That material can be pieced together, with considerable patience, by using the CDPP's advice, considering each individual warrant, then working out which of the charges the CDPP found could have dual criminality and what portions in the voluminous material supported them. It is difficult to imagine that a busy Minister would have had the time to engage in such a perplexing task with such disordered material, especially when his senior advisers had recommended, and the CDPP had told him it was in order for, him to sign the amended notice. It was a task which counsel for the parties essayed, somewhat summarily, for the purposes of the hearing. Each prepared tables referring to parts of the evidence which were said to relate to particular paragraphs in the s 16 notice. But there was only brief reference in argument to the detail of the material and how it supported or failed to support each paragraph in the s 16 notice based on warrant 5.

203 The Minister relied on the terms of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice and, particularly, its preface, which reads:
 
 'To a magistrate before whom the person named in this notice is brought: 
 
 I, David Albert Lloyd Johnston, Minister for Justice and Customs of the Commonwealth of Australia, under subsection 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 , state that an extradition request has been received from Finland, an extradition country, in relation to Jan Atso Tervonen for the following extradition offences:

<text>103 The danger in the Courts being more executive-minded than the executive was highlighted by Lord Atkin's famous dissent in Liversidge v Anderson [1941] UKHL 1 ; [1942] AC 206 at 244.

104 In exercising his power under s 16(1) to give the notice, Senator Ellison asked himself the wrong question, namely whether his advisors considered that the notice should be issued and were satisfied of any matters which the statute required, including the formation of an opinion as to dual criminality under s 16(2)(a)(ii). The qualification on the Attorney-General's power to issue a notice under s 16(1) imposed by the requirement of the formation of the various opinions under s 16(2) is an important safeguard for the person whose extradition is sought. If in truth the Attorney-General, or Minister exercising the power in s 16(1) to give a notice, does not address for himself or herself the formation of the opinions on a proper factual basis under s 16(2) then the function of giving the notice has not been fulfilled in accordance with the Act.

105 I am of opinion that Senator Ellison did not consider whether Mr Tervonen's acts or omissions or equivalent conduct, had it taken place in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia. Rather, he accepted the opinions of others without examining the facts upon which those opinions were based. This was not a performance of his statutory function in accordance with law. The whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid.</text>

<text>87 When Peters 16 NSWLR 24 was affirmed in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4 ; (1990) 169 CLR 307 the issue of severance of the warrants was put to one side. Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that it was clear that a warrant could, and had, to be construed so as not to do what the statute under which it was authorised itself did not purport to do. They held a State statute did not purport to authorise a breach of a federal law, s 219B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). They found that the warrants in that case were wholly valid ( Love 169 CLR at 323).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>28 A full and accurate summary of all material matters and facts ordinarily would enable a minister to discharge a function which legislation required be performed personally by the minister. A minister who acted on such a full and accurate summary would not have delegated any part of the decision-making process to the officials who prepared the summary. If, on the other hand, the summary or other material provided by the department or the minister's advisers omitted a material fact, then the minister would not make a decision on the basis of what parliament required him or her to take into account. Thus the minister would not perform the very function which parliament intended be performed: cf: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 31 per Gibbs CJ. Indeed, depending on the volume of material, a full and accurate, but succinct, summary of material may assist a minister properly to perform the function of exercising the discretion personally confided upon him or her by the statute.

29 Where a statute requires a minister to exercise a discretion personally and the material put before him or her by the department fails to draw to his or her attention a relevant fact which is not insignificant or insubstantial, a valid decision cannot be made because the minister will not have before him or her all relevant material: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 30-31 per Gibbs CJ, 37-38 per Mason J, 65-67 per Brennan J, 71 per Dawson J. If a department were to determine which facts or matters are provided to the minister for him or her to take into account to exercise such a discretion, then the decision-making function will be bifurcated impermissibly, because the department will have assumed a delegation of power which the statute did not permit: namely, the power to decide what facts and matters the minister may take into account. That bifurcation is not permitted where the statute requires the minister personally to exercise the discretion, for the reasons explained by Mason J in Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 37-38.

30 Thus, in order to form the opinion that a person is an extraditable person under s 16(2)(a)(i), the Attorney-General must consider whether the requirements of s 6 (which defines 'extraditable person') have been met. If the request for extradition is based on one or more warrants for the arrest of the person, the Attorney-General must be of opinion that each warrant has been received and that it satisfies the requirements of s 6 (and here, Art 7(2) of the treaty). The Attorney-General must see what has been provided with the request for extradition as the warrant (or its translation) in order to form the opinion in s 16(2)(a)(i). It would not be sufficient for the Attorney-General merely to be told that such a warrant existed or to have a summary of it and its contents relating to the offence or offences concerned. That is because the Act requires the Attorney-General to form an opinion that a warrant meeting the terms of s 6 actually exists.

31 Article 7(2)(a) of the Treaty requires the request for extradition to be accompanied by a copy of the warrant together with the statement of each offence for which extradition is sought and a statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the person whose extradition is sought in respect of each offence. The statement of each offence is a matter which may be capable of accurate summation, as may the statement of the acts or omissions. Much will depend upon the form in which the extradition country presents the material. As became apparent when the brief provided to Senator Johnston was tendered, he was confronted with over 250 pages of material which Finland had furnished in support of its request. The material was by no means easy to follow or digest in the form in which it was presented. As Brennan J said in Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 66:
 
 'The Parliament can be taken to intend that the Minister will retain control of the process of decision-making while being assisted to make the decision by departmental analysis, evaluation and pr&eacute;cis of the material relevant to that decision.'

32 I am of opinion that the Minister can form the opinion in relation to the conduct of the person for which s 16(2)(a)(ii) provides by use of a full and accurate summary of that conduct. I reject Mr Tervonen's argument that s 16(2)(a) and or Art 7(2) of the treaty require the Minister to be provided with the full material furnished by Finland as the requesting State.

33 Each of the Finnish warrants recited that Mr Tervonen was 'suspected on probable cause' of one or more offences. Mr Tervonen argued that the language of the warrants did not meet the threshold set in s 6(a)(i) of being warrants which were in force for his arrest '... in relation to an offence ... against the law of [Finland] that the person is accused of having committed ...'. He argued that being suspected on probable cause was something less than being accused of having committed an offence.

41 In the context of Australian law, a statement that a person has been arrested by the police and charged with an offence is capable of bearing a meaning that the police suspected him or her of having committed the offence and that the arresting officers had reasonable cause for doing so: Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison [1982] HCA 50 ; (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 301 per Mason J. That case dealt with defamatory meanings that might be conveyed to ordinary, reasonable Australians by a statement of a police arrest and charge.

92 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 223-224 [39] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to this principle. They distinguished it from a situation where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, when the Court may be able to infer that he had no good reason (cf: per Gibbs CJ in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664).

207 The last alternative is that Senator Johnston considered the whole matter afresh, and that it is possible to sever the portions of the notice relating to warrant 5 which I have found to be invalid, leaving the balance of the notice intact. In Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 40-41, Mason J said:
 
 'The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB at 228.'</text>

They said that the Court could examine whether the decision-maker had or had not taken relevant, and only relevant, matters into account. If that examination resulted in a conclusion that the material relied on by the Minister was open to be considered, '... there is a further, strictly limited but nevertheless potentially available, basis for review which focuses upon the outcome of the decision-making process'. That basis involved whether the decision-maker acted in good faith and had not acted merely arbitrarily or capriciously: Buck 135 CLR at 118-119 per Gibbs J.</text>

<text>115 Importantly, s 16(3) contemplates that the Attorney-General may give a notice before an individual has been remanded under s 15. So, Senator Johnston had power to give a fresh s 16(1) notice when he did, even though Mr Tervonen was not then held on remand pursuant to s 15 because any reasonable time under s 17(2) for giving a notice after 18 August 2006 had long since expired and, in any event, no attempt had been made to seek such an extension from a magistrate. That is, even though Mr Tervonen was not being held in custody under s 15, and his detention was unlawful, the Act did not operate to deprive Senator Johnston of the power to give a fresh s 16(1) notice. That is because the power to issue a notice under s 16(1) had not been exercised validly, and thus at all, before then: Minister for Immigration v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597.

<tocase>Peters v Attorney-General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24</tocase>
<text>83 The Minister relied on authorities on severance of portions of search warrants in support of his argument that the invalid portions should be severed from Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. There, courts have held that it is possible to sever those parts of a warrant which were issued in excess of power: see per McHugh JA in Peters v Attorney-General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24 at 41D-42B and per Hely J in Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 210-211 [151] .

84 The principle upon which those decisions proceeded was an application of provisions such as ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). These evince a legislative intention to preserve the validity of so much of an enactment, action or instrument authorised by law as would be supported by use of the power relied upon, notwithstanding that some other part of the enactment, action or instrument in question has been found to be beyond the power relied upon for its making. Thus, s 46(2) provides that if any instrument, such as a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act , made pursuant to an enactment would be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, '... it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power'. A search warrant has been held to be such an instrument, as McHugh JA pointed out in Peters 16 NSWLR at 41E. Accordingly, he held that the search warrants in that case were to be read and construed, to the extent that they could be read, as valid instruments. He applied what Dixon J had said in Andrews v Howell [1941] HCA 20 ; (1941) 65 CLR 255 at 281 in relation to ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act . A notice under s 16 of the Act is also such an instrument.

87 When Peters 16 NSWLR 24 was affirmed in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4 ; (1990) 169 CLR 307 the issue of severance of the warrants was put to one side. Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that it was clear that a warrant could, and had, to be construed so as not to do what the statute under which it was authorised itself did not purport to do. They held a State statute did not purport to authorise a breach of a federal law, s 219B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). They found that the warrants in that case were wholly valid ( Love 169 CLR at 323).</text>

<tocase>Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 39</tocase>
<text>130 It follows that Senator Johnston was authorised to administer the provisions of the Extradition Act by force of s 19A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act : Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403 [17] - [18] per Gleeson CJ, 416 [67]-[68] per Gaudron J, 451-452 [182]-[187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, 497-500 [319]-[325] per Kirby J, 519 [380] per Callinan J. He had power to act as the Attorney-General for the purposes of the Extradition Act in circumstances of the present matter.

131 During the course of the hearing before me privilege was waived, in stages, on a number of different portions of the material before Senator Johnston. As privilege was waived, a greater appreciation of what was before the Minister emerged. First, there was a partial waiver of some of the redacted material in the briefing note and other documents which recorded Senator Johnston's decision of 30 April 2007 to issue the amended s 16 notice. Secondly, Senator Johnston waived privilege that had previously been claimed over the whole of the dual criminality advice provided to him by the CDPP. Next, some further material was revealed in the decision record of 30 April 2007. Lastly, the departmental advice to Senator Johnston about the reconditions for the issue of the s 16 notice was completely revealed.

132 Mr Tervonen argued that pars (24)-(52) and (57)-(58) of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice had been founded on warrant 5. He complained that these paragraphs in the s 16 notice were deficient on two bases:
 
 
 (1) As to pars (24)-(27), (30)-(32), (34), (37)-(39), (41), (42), (44), (45), (49), (50), (57) and (58)
 Mr Tervonen said that these paragraphs, superficially, appear to relate to the material before the Minister, but the dates of the acts or omissions in that material and the notice do not relate to the dates in warrant 5. Accordingly, that disconformity, if established, renders at least those paragraphs in the s 16 notice bad. 
 
 
 (2) As to pars (24)-(52), (57) and (58) 
 
 
 Mr Tervonen argued that pars 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 40, 43, 46-48, 51 and 52 as well as those in (1) above were not based on sufficient material identifying Mr Tervonen's alleged acts or omissions.</text>

If these requirements are not met, then the exercise of judgment, however bona fide it may be, becomes capable of challenge ...'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1953/22.html</AustLII>
<text>91 In The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 119-120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ referred to the important distinction between a mere insufficiency of evidence or other materials to support a conclusion of fact when the function of finding the fact has been committed to a person or body by the Parliament and, on the other hand, the absence of any foundation in fact for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which, in point of law, the existence of the power depends. They said that it was not enough if the repository of the power, properly interpreting the section of the Act under which it was conferred and applying the correct test:
 
 '... nevertheless satisfies itself or himself on inadequate material that facts exist which in truth would fulfil the conditions which one or other or both of those paragraphs prescribe. The inadequacy of the material is not in itself a ground for prohibition. But it is a circumstance which may support the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters. If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact.'

96 While s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act requires the Court to approach the continued operation of an instrument, part of which has been made in excess of power, with a presumption of validity, that does not deny the application of the principle identified in Australian Stevedoring 88 CLR at 119-120. If the Court comes to the conclusion that in truth the power of the Attorney-General to give a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise did not exist in law and in fact, namely, that the opinion had not been formed under s 16(2)(a)(ii) , then s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act will not apply. This is because of the requirement that unless the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) has been formed by the Attorney-General on a proper basis, the chapeau in s 16(2) provides that he or she shall not give the notice under s 16(1).</text>

<tocase>Truong v The Queen [2004] HCA 10 ; (2004) 223 CLR 122</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/10.html</AustLII>
<text>62 The CDPP's advice in relation to offence 2 in warrant 1, which became the subject of par (2) in the notice, was similar in its failure to identify any act or omission of Mr Tervonen. Thus, the concrete exercise described by Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ in Truong v The Queen [2004] HCA 10 ; (2004) 223 CLR 122 at 142 [29] , 143 [33] (and see too per Hayne J at 185 [189], 187 [196]-[197]) could not be performed because the description of the factual elements failed to identify acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen.

63 Similarly the CDPP's advice in relation to offence 4 in warrant 1, which became the subject of par (3) in the notice, asserted that Mr Tervonen acted in concert with one Seppala and 'ordered, hired or otherwise intentionally persuaded three persons to order goods from various suppliers' (emphasis added). Once again, this description is too general. If the case were based on circumstantial evidence, the acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen from which the inference of his complicity could be drawn needed to be stated. Did Mr Tervonen order one of the three people to do something? Did he hire one of them to do it? Did he 'otherwise intentionally persuade' someone? Or, did he direct Seppala to do one or more of those things? As Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ observed in Truong 223 CLR at 143 [33] (in relation to whether a person extradited to Australia on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and murder a man could be convicted of the substantive offences of the kidnap and murder by procuring them to occur):
 
 'Agreement (here, agreement to commit a crime) is the essence of conspiracy, but the nature and scope of the alleged agreement is important when performing the exercise, required by the statute, of identifying the acts or omissions by virtue of which the particular offence of conspiracy in question has, or is alleged to have, been committed.'

64 The generality and abstraction of the CDPP's description of offence 4 in warrant 1 was such that Senator Ellison could not have formed the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of par (3) of his s 16 notice. There was a similar absence of acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen in the material before Senator Ellison in respect of the following:
 Warrant Offence number in warrant Paragraph number in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice 1 5 4 1 8 6 1 9 7 1 10 8 1 11 9 2 1 and 2 10 2 5 12
(see below) 4 1 17 
(see below) 4 2 18 4 4 19 4 5 20 4 6 21 4 7 22 4 10 23 5 1-8, 10-14, 16-19, 21, 22,
24-28, 30-33, 35-39, 41-43,
45-56 24-52
(see below) 7 1 55 8 1 56
(see below)

65 Offence 5 in warrant 2 was described as a registration offence under Chapter 16, section 7(1) of the Finnish Penal Code. This became the subject of par (12) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. The CDPP described it in these terms:
 
 'The allegation is that [Mr] Tervonen, together with others, provided false information to the National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland by providing information to be entered in the register ...' 
 

that three named persons had taken up particular positions in respect of a company when none of them had consented to do so. The CDPP continued:
 
 'Whilst it is not directly stated in the acts and omissions, there is a reference under the heading Evidence to the fact that the signatures of [two of the persons] have not been made by the persons themselves. If the magistrate accepts that this information forms part of the statement of acts and omissions, the conduct may amount to an offence of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).'

92 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 223-224 [39] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to this principle. They distinguished it from a situation where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, when the Court may be able to infer that he had no good reason (cf: per Gibbs CJ in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664).

101 There is no basis to sever portions of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. He never formed the opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) based on considering Mr Tervonen's alleged conduct. That step was a precondition of the exercise of the power to give the notice, as s 16(2) provided. As Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ said in Truong 223 CLR at 142 [29] the exercise required by s 16 is a concrete one, not an abstract one. They said it was to proceed by reference to the actual conduct alleged against the person in question.

170 The concrete exercise required by s 16 ( Truong 223 CLR at 142 [29]) required Senator Johnston to consider the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen before he could form any opinion about the matters in warrant 5. Apart from the above offences in relation to Ms Lindholm, the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen in the material before Senator Johnston was at too great a level of generality, or even abstraction, to enable him to form an opinion which satisfied the requirements of s 16(2)(a) of the Act and Art 7(2)(a) of the treaty. As the Full Court pointed out in Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], what was required was 'a statement of what is alleged to have been actually done or omitted'. The material before Senator Johnston failed to identify what Mr Tervonen was alleged actually to have done or omitted to do in a manner which would enable the identification of any part of his conduct as amounting to an equivalent offence in New South Wales had he done or omitted to do those or some of those things in that State.</text>

<tocase>Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth (2006) 227 CLR 614</tocase>
<text>8 A principal object of the Act is to codify the law in relation to the extradition of persons from Australia to extradition countries without determining the guilt or innocence of a person whose extradition is sought. A second object is to enable Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties (s 3(a) and (c)). The Act is structured in a way that permits decisions to be taken at a number of points in the extradition process which may halt that process, either in part or entirely. The Act contemplates four stages in the extradition process, namely: commencement, remand, determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender and executive determination that the person be surrendered: Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth (2006) 227 CLR 614 at 628 [29] per Gleeson CJ, 635-636 [55] per Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Heydon J agreed on this issue at 676 [222]), 657 [144] per Kirby J applying Harris v Attorney-General (Cth) (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389. Mr Tervonen's applications in the present case arise at an early point in the process.

9 Initially an extradition country, here Finland, must make an application to a magistrate, sitting as persona designata , for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person under s 12(1) of the Act. If the magistrate is satisfied, on the basis of the information given by affidavit, that the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country, the magistrate must issue the warrant in statutory form for the arrest of the person (s 12(1)(b)). The magistrate must then send to the Attorney-General a report saying that he or she has issued the warrant together with a copy of the affidavit (s 12(2)). The Attorney-General is then given a discretion, by s 12(3), to cancel the warrant where he or she decides not to issue a notice under s 16(1) in relation to the person or considers for any other reason that the warrant should be cancelled. Cancellation is effected by the Attorney-General directing the magistrate to cancel the warrant (s 12(3)).

10 If the warrant is not cancelled, the person, when found, is then arrested and must be brought before a magistrate in the State or Territory where the arrest occurs as soon as practicable (s 15(1)). Unless there are special circumstances justifying the remand of a person on bail, the magistrate must remand the person in custody for such period or periods that may be necessary for the proceedings to be brought, relevantly, under s 19 of the Act (s 15(2) and (6)).

88 It is important to bear in mind that in determining whether a notice given by the Attorney-General or Minister is wholly or partly valid for the purposes of s 16 of the Extradition Act , one of the significant effects of the notice is that it will authorise the detention in custody of the person who is its subject: Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ. In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ noted that a search warrant authorised an invasion of premises without the consent of the persons in lawful possession or occupation. They said that the validity of such a warrant was necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the Court noted that the legislature had sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions to his privacy and property. They noted that in enacting the section authorising the issue of search warrants, the Queensland legislature had given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. However, the Court pointed out that the common law had long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions. They then discussed the exceptions which many State and Commonwealth statutes had made to the common law position. They said ( George 170 CLR at 110-111):
 
 'Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation.'

100 The filter which the Parliament intended be applied to extradition requests under s 16 was the formation of a genuine and real opinion by the Attorney-General, or other Minister exercising the power to give a notice under s 16(1). A notice under s 16 provides a lawful authorisation for the continuing detention of a person pursuant to the operation of s 17 of the Act. The Court should not impute to the Parliament an intention to authorise interference with the fundamental right to liberty where it does not appear that the Attorney-General or Minister actually turned his or her mind to the question s 16(2) requires be addressed: Coco 179 CLR at 537; see too Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ.</text>

 'It is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted.'

213 I am comfortably satisfied that on the material before me, which it was in the power of the Minister to supplement, had he chosen, by revealing in evidence the redacted portions of the material before him, Senator Johnston failed to discharge the exact function he was required to discharge in accordance with law ( Vetter 202 CLR at 454 [36]). In those circumstances, it would be wrong to sever portions of the instrument based on mere speculation that, despite the errors I have found, and the absence of evidence of what he was told could be invalid in Senator Ellison's notice, the Minister addressed the rest of the amended s 16 notice correctly. He has provided no evidence to support a finding that he did. Rather, I am of opinion that by reason of the jurisdictional and other errors in his failure to address those parts of the amended s 16 notice which I have found to be invalid, and on the evidence before me, Senator Johnston did not form the opinions required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of any paragraph in the notice.

214 For the reasons that I have given, I am of opinion that Mr Tervonen's challenges have succeeded in substance. In summary, I have formed the preliminary view that, subject to hearing the parties, I should make orders to the effect of:
 
 (a) declaring each s 16 notice invalid;
 (b) quashing each s 16 notice; 
 
 
 (c) directing the Minister to issue a notice in statutory form pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Act directing a magistrate to order the release of Mr Tervonen from custody;
 (d) requiring the Minister to pay Mr Tervonen's costs.

215 The parties asked that I provide them with my reasons and an opportunity to address the precise form of relief. I will therefore order that the proceedings be stood over for argument on the appropriate relief to give effect to these reasons.
 I certify that the preceding two hundred and fifteen (215) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<text>83 The Minister relied on authorities on severance of portions of search warrants in support of his argument that the invalid portions should be severed from Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. There, courts have held that it is possible to sever those parts of a warrant which were issued in excess of power: see per McHugh JA in Peters v Attorney-General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24 at 41D-42B and per Hely J in Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 210-211 [151] .</text>

<tocase>Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs (2007) 157 FCR 28</tocase>
<text>2 Later in 2006, Mr Tervonen commenced these proceedings, challenging Senator Ellison's notice. I refused interlocutory relief on the basis of Mr Tervonen's challenges, as then formulated by him when he was self-represented: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 464. Shortly after I delivered my judgment, the Full Court of this Court handed down its decision in Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs (2007) 157 FCR 286. I then appointed counsel under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth) to represent Mr Tervonen on the final hearing. His counsel has reformulated Mr Tervonen's claims.

3 On 30 April 2007, before the date of the final hearing, Senator Ellison's successor in the office of Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Honourable David Johnston, signed what was intituled 'Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request' under s 16(1) of the Act. That second s 16 notice was given in respect of all of the original offences in Senator Ellison's notice together with seven further ones identified in its paragraphs (57) and (58).

4 Mr Tervonen has challenged the validity of each s 16 notice. He argued that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid because:
 
 
 (1) the Minister did not have before him any statement of Mr Tervonen's conduct or his acts or omissions and so Senator Ellison could not form the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required, viz, that the same, or equivalent conduct, acts or omissions, if committed in Australia, would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia. The material before Senator Ellison was thus said to be so deficient (relying on Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45]) that the Minister could not have formed the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required;
 (2) the language of the Finnish warrants on their face was incapable of satisfying the definition of 'extraditable person' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act because they did not, in terms, seek his arrest as a person actually charged or accused of an offence. Rather, they sought his arrest on the basis that they alleged that he was 'suspected with probable cause' of having committed one or a number of offences. Mr Tervonen said that the Minister could not have formed the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) in the absence of any material before him to establish that the formulation used in each of the Finnish warrants was in fact a warrant within s 6(a)(i);
 (3) Article 7(2) of the Treaty between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 7 June 1984 as amended by Article 3 of the Protocol between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985 contained in Schedule 2 of the Extradition (Finland) Regulations 1988 (Cth) required Finland to accompany its request for his extradition with a statement of each offence for which extradition was sought together with a statement of the acts or omissions which were alleged against Mr Tervonen in respect of each offence. Mr Tervonen argued that because in August 2006 Senator Ellison personally did not have before him all of this material, as required by the treaty, he could not issue the notice.

5 However, Mr Tervonen's principal challenge was against Senator Johnston's s 16 notice. He argued that:
 
 
 (1) Senator Johnston as Minister for Justice and Customs was not able to exercise the statutory powers and functions specifically conferred on the Attorney-General by s 16 of the Act;
 (2) under the Act it is not open for the Attorney-General, or the Minister administering the Act, to issue a second notice in respect of the same request;
 (3) the particularisation of his acts and omissions in the material before Senator Johnston relating to pars (24)-(52), (57) and (58) of the second s 16 notice was insufficient to enable the Minister to form the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii), so that the whole notice was invalid or those paragraphs were;
 (4) the language of the Finnish warrants was incapable of satisfying the statutory definition of 'extraditable person' on the same basis as ground (2) in respect of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.

6 The Minister argued that Mr Tervonen's challenges should fail and that:
 
 
 &#8226; each notice was valid;
 &#8226; Senator Ellison's notice was not acted on by the magistrate, and so it was of no present relevance;
 &#8226; if any deficiency were established in respect of the material before either Minister in relation to particular paragraphs in their s 16 notices, those paragraphs should be severed and the balance of notice(s) would be valid;
 &#8226; Senator Johnston's s 16 notice was either a validly amended version of his predecessor's notice or a valid, newly made, s 16 notice.

39 The Attorney-General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law: Williams 157 FCR at 298 [49]. Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s 6(a)(i) and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it (as the decision of the Full Court, which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; 185 CLR 528, illustrates). For this reason s 16(2)(a)(i) is framed so that the Attorney-General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person.

46 However, in Williams at 157 FCR at 296 [42], the Full Court held that Cooper J's approach was incorrect. They held that s 16(2)(a)(ii) of the Act required the Minister to have before him or her a statement of what was alleged to have been actually done or omitted, not a mere restatement of the charge in respect of which extradition was sought: Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], 298 [49]. In that case the material before the Minister had not included a statement of the elements of the offence in the extradition country. Gyles, Allsop and Buchanan JJ said ( Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50]):
 
 'The opinion which must be held by the Attorney General (or the responsible Minister) under s 16(2)(a)(ii) must relate to, and be based on, actual conduct said to constitute, in a factual sense, the commission of an identified offence. In the present case there was no information before the Minister to furnish that knowledge. Accordingly, the Minister was not in a position to form an opinion about Mr Williams' conduct, whether in reliance on advice or personally, so as to conclude that the requirements of s 16(2)(a)(ii) were met. As a result the opinion was not validly formed.'

51 This offence became the subject of par (1) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice. The elements of Chapter 36, section 2(1) of the Penal Code were not before the Minister. As the Full Court recognised in Williams 157 FCR at 298 [49], the Attorney-General or responsible Minister cannot be taken to be an expert in the foreign law. Rather, the Minister must be expected to form a view about whether identified acts or omissions (or equivalent conduct) would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.

52 The allegations concerning Mr Tervonen were set out in the CDPP's advice at a level of generality which did not identify any precise act or omission which Mr Tervonen himself was alleged to have done or omitted to do. Rather, Mr Tervonen and others were alleged to have misled a number of parties. This allegation did not identify what Mr Tervonen, or the others for that matter, did to mislead any person. Next, the CDPP's summary asserted that Mr Tervonen and the others gained control of a company in circumstances where its managing director was said not to have control over it.

53 The CDPP's advice did not put before Senator Ellison any act or omission of Mr Tervonen relating to:
 
 
 &#8226; his or 'the others' gaining control over the company or overriding its director;
 &#8226; why the director 'in reality did not have control over the company';
 &#8226; the opening of accounts 'with an overdraft facility with several suppliers and service providers';
 &#8226; what an 'overdraft facility' was or how it was operated on for that purpose;
 &#8226; how the goods and services were ordered from the supplier companies 'using the name' of the director.

57 This passage highlights the necessity that the facts must be stated in such a way that the Minister can be satisfied that the particular conduct, being acts or omissions of the person whose extradition is sought, would have been sufficient to constitute an extradition offence in relation to Australia. Dixon J explained that a prosecutor must identify not only the legal nature of the offence with which a defendant is charged, but also the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge: Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 489-490; see too John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42 ; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 520-521 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; see Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50]. The position is similar in respect of European arrest warrants: Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31 at 52 [48] per Lord Hope of Craighead with whom the rest of the House agreed on this issue: see at 39 [2], 58-59 [71], 59 [72], 61 [82].

76 The CDPP's consideration of offences 48, 49 and 50 in warrant 5 was confined simply to setting out a number for each of the offences, describing it in a general way and referring to the section of the Finnish statute to which the numbered offence related. There was no information whatsoever provided about the registration offences, let alone the conduct of Mr Tervonen alleged to give rise to them. The Minister had no information about any conduct of Mr Tervonen in respect of offences 48, 49 and 50 on which to form the opinion required in s 16(2)(a)(ii) to justify him signing the s 16 notice based on this material: Williams 157 FCR at 296-297 [45], 298 [50]. Other offences were included in Senator Ellison's notice, such as aggravated fraud and aggravated forgery (pars (46) and (47)) without any discussion about what the conduct was. The Minister formally conceded that pars (34)-(52) of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice should be severed from his notice. This concession was said to be made because the Minister did not have sufficient material before him to enable him to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of pars (34)-(52). It was correctly made.

77 Warrant 8 asserted that Mr Tervonen was suspected 'with probable cause' of the following criminal act:
 
 'Aggravated dishonesty by a debtor, 25 June 2001 to 5 July 2001, Helsinki.' 
 

Warrant 8 stated that the grounds on which that charge was based were detailed in an appended claim for arrest, but no such claim for arrest was included in the material before Senator Ellison.

78 The CDPP's advice discussed this count, which became the subject of par (56) of Senator Ellison's notice, as follows:
 
 ' Offence 1 Aggravated Dishonesty by a Debtor Chapter 39, section 1a, Penal Code 
 
 
 
 125. If it is accepted that Tervonen was an officer of the company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) , his conduct may amount to an offence of an officer dishonestly using his position with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for themselves or someone else, or causing a detriment to the corporation; or (b) recklessly as to whether the use may result in themselves or someone else directly or indirectly gaining an advantage, or in causing detriment to the corporation. 
 
 126. The maximum penalty for an offence against section 184(1) or section 184(2) the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) , is imprisonment for 5 years (Schedule 3, Item 30).' (emphasis added)

89 In Williams 157 FCR at 296 [40] the Full Court observed that cases such a Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-276, Avon Downs v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J and Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119 per Gibbs J identified two relevant principles upon which the Court may examine, on judicial review, the validity of a notice under s 16 of the Extradition Act . They said that the Court could examine whether the decision-maker had or had not taken relevant, and only relevant, matters into account. If that examination resulted in a conclusion that the material relied on by the Minister was open to be considered, '... there is a further, strictly limited but nevertheless potentially available, basis for review which focuses upon the outcome of the decision-making process'. That basis involved whether the decision-maker acted in good faith and had not acted merely arbitrarily or capriciously: Buck 135 CLR at 118-119 per Gibbs J.

98 I am of opinion that Senator Ellison, likewise, purported to exercise a power different from that which the statute reposed in him. Had Senator Ellison approached the function of forming the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in accordance with law (as it had subsequently been declared in Williams 157 FCR 286), he would have noticed the deficiencies in the material before him. He would then have considered that many of the proposed paragraphs of the draft notice which he signed were not justified. I am satisfied that he did not consider the material before him in the way in which s 16(2) required. Rather, the inference which I am satisfied should be drawn is that Senator Ellison deferred to or accepted the opinion of the CDPP without himself considering any of the conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii). Senator Ellison simply accepted the CDPP's advice as authorising him to sign the s 16(1) notice.

99 While I have found that Senator Ellison erred in his approach, that error was understandable. I am not intending to criticise him in these reasons. He did not have the benefit of the decision, given months later, in Williams 157 FCR 286, but he acted on the then state of the law as interpreted by Cooper J in Foster 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394.

102 Moreover, I am unable to conclude that Senator Ellison applied the correct test in considering those parts of the s 16 notice which were supportable on the material before him. There is no basis to think he applied two different tests, the correct one to the material in the CDPP's advice which contained sufficient acts and omissions of Mr Tervonen to justify one or more paragraphs in the draft notice, and the incorrect one to the balance. That would be irrational. The Minister simply did not apply the right test of forming his own opinion on the manner laid down in Williams 157 FCR 286. Thus, the whole notice was invalid and there was nothing on which s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act could operate.

107 If Senator Ellison's s 16 notice were invalid, Mr Tervonen argued that then Senator Johnston had no power to issue his s 16 notice. The Minister's principal submission was that it would be futile to grant relief in respect of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice because the proceedings for Mr Tervonen's s 19 hearing had been taken on Senator Johnston's s 16 notice: see Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 159 FCR 181 at 194 [48] per Besanko J, with whom Moore and Buchanan JJ agreed.

111 At no time after Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was issued was the process contemplated by s 17 of the Extradition Act followed. That is hardly surprising since, at least until the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, no-one would have considered that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid. However, it was. Thus, no s 16(1) notice had been given by the Attorney-General or Senator Ellison in the 45 day period following Mr Tervonen's remand under s 15. Therefore, s 17(2) required that Mr Tervonen be brought before a magistrate who could exercise the power to continue his remand during a period which he or she considered in all the circumstances to be reasonable for the giving of a notice under s 16 or to order Mr Tervonen's release. But that did not happen. The consequence is that no magistrate ever exercised any power under s 17(2) as the Act required. And s 17(3) required that if a s 16(1) notice was not given within the 45 day period, or a further extended period, under s 17(2), the magistrate must order the release of a person who was Mr Tervonen.

112 The language in which ss 17(2) and (3) are cast is in imperative terms. The object of those sections is to protect an individual who has been arrested and placed on remand in custody or on bail under s 15 pursuant to a warrant issued by a magistrate by the request of an extradition country. The purpose of the remand authorised by s 15 is to afford a limited period in which proper material can be placed before the Attorney-General so that he or she can determine whether to issue a notice under s 16(1). The Parliament has prescribed substantial limitations on the ability of an extradition country or the Attorney-General to delay the taking of steps to give a notice under s 16(1), should that course be pursued.

113 The process contemplated under ss 12 and 15 of a remand in custody or, in special circumstances, on bail (s 15(6)), involves an interference with the liberty of an individual who may be a subject or citizen of Australia or an alien. Executive interference with the liberty of an individual has always been jealously scrutinised by the Courts. There is a legislative intent evinced in s 17 that this should remain so for the purposes of the Extradition Act . Thus, if the magistrate is satisfied that a notice under s 16(1) is likely to be given within a particular period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, he or she is given authority to extend the time of the remand beyond 45 days. But, if the magistrate is not so satisfied, or if the period he or she allowed expires, the individual must be released from custody or discharged from any recognisances on which bail was granted to him or her (ss 17(2) and (3)).

117 But, when those advising Senator Johnston appreciated that a consequence of Williams 157 FCR 286 (which was decided on 22 March 2007) may be that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly invalid, Senator Johnston should have caused Finland to be notified so that it could decide whether to seek to have a fresh warrant issued for the arrest of Mr Tervonen so that he could be brought before a magistrate under s 12. Instead, Senator Johnston proceeded as if Mr Tervonen were lawfully on remand under s 15.

118 The First Assistant Secretary, International Crime Corporation Division, provided a memorandum to Senator Johnston on 27 April 2007. In the final but still partly redacted version of that memorandum which was tendered in evidence, the Minister was told that the deadline for consideration of the s 16 notice which he was to sign was 'as soon as possible' and that his office was aware of the urgency associated with the matter. He was told that there was a risk that the existing s 16 notice issued may be found to be partly invalid. So far as appears from the unredacted portions of this memorandum, the Minister was not made aware of the possibility that the notice might be, as I have found, wholly invalid.

119 The consequence of partial invalidity would have been that any remaining valid portions of the notice would have supported Mr Tervonen's continuing detention on remand under s 15. The memorandum informed Senator Johnston that it was arguable, in light of the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, that:
 
 
 &#8226; the submission provided to Senator Ellison did not provide a sufficient description of the conduct 'constituting some of the offences for which Mr Tervonen's extradition was sought to enable the Minister to form the requisite opinion under subparagraph 16(2)(a)(ii)' (emphasis added);
 &#8226; as a result there was a risk that the existing notice might be found to be partly invalid;
 &#8226; there were also 7 additional offences referred to in pars (57) and (58) of the proposed draft notice;
 &#8226; the action required by him was to issue an amended s 16 notice; and
 &#8226; the extradition proceedings under s 19 were listed for hearing on 8 May 2007.

120 Accordingly, on the evidence before me, Senator Johnston was not aware of the possibility that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly invalid and that if it were it may have affected the obligations of Finland or Senator Johnston to bring Mr Tervonen before a magistrate. Nor does the evidence reveal which portion or portions of Senator Ellison's notice Senator Johnston was informed might be invalid.

121 What, then, is the status of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice in those circumstances?

170 The concrete exercise required by s 16 ( Truong 223 CLR at 142 [29]) required Senator Johnston to consider the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen before he could form any opinion about the matters in warrant 5. Apart from the above offences in relation to Ms Lindholm, the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen in the material before Senator Johnston was at too great a level of generality, or even abstraction, to enable him to form an opinion which satisfied the requirements of s 16(2)(a) of the Act and Art 7(2)(a) of the treaty. As the Full Court pointed out in Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], what was required was 'a statement of what is alleged to have been actually done or omitted'. The material before Senator Johnston failed to identify what Mr Tervonen was alleged actually to have done or omitted to do in a manner which would enable the identification of any part of his conduct as amounting to an equivalent offence in New South Wales had he done or omitted to do those or some of those things in that State.

192 The First Assistant Secretary suggested, at one point, to Senator Johnston that he issue an amended s 16 notice. The Minister was told that, having regard to the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, the CDPP provided further advice adding an additional 7 offences set out in pars (57) and (58). And, the First Assistant Secretary's advice also informed Senator Johnston that he had to consider each of the offences in the draft notice and determine whether he was of the opinions in s 16(2)(a)(i) and (ii). The First Assistant Secretary's briefing note then discussed some matters covering almost a page which were redacted for reasons of legal professional privilege and continued by recommending that he:
 
 '... issue a new section 16 notice ... [redactions made] ... 
 
 
 
 &#8226; [redaction made]
 &#8226; to ensure that the additional (seven) extradition offences [redaction made] are put before the Magistrate for the purposes of his determination under section 19 Extradition Act ...'

193 The Minister was then informed that the Department considered the requirements of s 16 of the Extradition Act and Article 7 of the treaty had '... been met for the offences listed in the attached fresh section 16 notice' (emphasis added).

194 During the hearing, the parties' arguments changed from the positions taken in written submissions because more material was revealed from portions of the briefing material given to Senator Johnston after legal professional privilege was partially waived. Ultimately, Senator Johnston's attention was directed to the CDPP's fresh advice and he was informed:
 
 'Taking into account the CDPP advice in relation to the conduct set out in the extradition request from Finland (including the supplementary documentation provided in support of the request), you may be of the opinion that if Mr Tervonen had engaged in conduct constituting the Finnish offences listed in the section 16 notice in New South Wales at the time the extradition request was received (August 2006), that conduct would have constituted extradition offences in relation to Australia.'

198 Senator Johnston did not give a fresh s 16 notice. By its very terms, his was an 'Amended Notice'. Thus, he may have proceeded on the basis that there was a risk some of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid or affected by jurisdictional error of the kind identified in Williams 157 FCR 286. But there is no basis in the evidence before me to suggest that Senator Johnston approached the matter completely afresh. I am not prepared to draw an inference that he did, on the incomplete material in evidence and the failure of the Minister to give any direct evidence of his decision-making.

199 What task Senator Johnston did undertake? Did he simply consider pars (57) and (58), being the amendments to the notice? Or, did he consider the whole of the notice afresh together with all of the material before him so as to come to the requisite opinion under s 16(2)(a)(i) and (ii) in respect of every single paragraph in the s 16 notice which he signed?

200 It is not uncommon when an amendment is made for the person making it to review the whole document, as amended, for the purposes of seeing that it then, as a whole, reflects that person's intentions or objectives. Thus, it is conceivable that Senator Johnston read all the material and satisfied himself that it was appropriate to sign the document in its totality, rather than merely focusing on two additional paragraphs that he had been advised to add. The evidence before me does not disclose what portions of Senator Ellison's notice Senator Johnston was told may have been susceptible to being found to be invalid. It is not possible for me to assess whether Senator Johnston looked at any particular paragraphs to address that question. There is no doubt that he had all of the material before him which had been provided by Finland and was aware of the risk that some, but not all, of the earlier s 16 notice might be invalid.

208 The Minister chose to tender selected portions of the material before him, while retaining claims for legal professional privilege on other portions. The portions on which privilege claims were maintained could have made clear the question which the Minister may have addressed having regard to the effect of the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286 in respect of some portion or portions of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice that may have been invalid. However, the Minister has not proved whether he had regard afresh to any particular part or parts of Senator Ellison's notice for the purposes of overcoming any perception of invalidity. Accordingly, the evidence is silent on whether the Minister directed his attention to any possible problem with respect to the paragraphs in the notice he ultimately signed which replicated paragraphs in Senator Ellison's notice for which I have held there was material on which he could have formed the opinions required by s 16(2)(a).

210 Here, Senator Johnston could have given a wholly fresh notice under s 16 in the form of the one he did. The provisions of s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act would apply to sever the portions of it relating to warrant 5 which I have found to be invalid, while leaving the balance of the notice valid and operative. But, if in signing the notice he asked himself the wrong question (as his predecessor had recently done in Williams 157 FCR 286) or confined the formation of his opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) to pars (57) and (58), then the whole notice would be bad because of jurisdictional error, namely the failure to form the opinions required in accordance with s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of any paragraphs other than pars (57) and (58). Nothing in s 46(2) would save it.

211 The only amendment actually made was the addition of pars (57) and (58) and I have held those to be invalid, as I have held the whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice to be. The Minister has put forward in submissions a variety of possible matters to which he may have directed himself, none of which identifies, beyond the intention to add pars (57) and (58), what he was actually doing.

212 Senator Johnston addressed whether pars (57) and (58) should be added to the 'amended notice'. But he came to the incorrect conclusion that they should. I am of opinion that he did not consider the whole of the material afresh in such a way as would justify me in severing portions of the notice to preserve its validity. A considerable part of the notice could not have satisfied Senator Johnston had he correctly considered forming an opinion in accordance with s 16(2)(a)(ii). While s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act enables those portions which I have found to be invalid to be severed from the notice, the material in evidence comfortably satisfies me that the Minister was not addressing himself to the correct question when considering the amended notice. As Dixon J said in Avon Downs 78 CLR at 360:
 
 'It is not necessary that you should be sure of the precise particular in which he has gone wrong. It is enough that you can see that in some way he must have failed in the discharge of his exact function according to law.'</text>

<text>167 There is no explanation of how Mr Tervonen, when he was in jail between April and August 2004, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the activities of any of Messrs Siira, Raappana or S&ouml;derqvist. In order to establish Mr Tervonen's liability as a secondary offender in Australia, it was necessary for Senator Johnston to have before him identified conduct of Mr Tervonen which showed his intentional participation in each offence, with knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up that offence: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 667 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ applying Giorgianni [1985] HCA 29 ; 156 CLR 473. It is here that the material provided by Finland fails to provide a substantive link between the conduct alleged and how Mr Tervonen could be found to have been a secondary offender under the law of New South Wales. This deficiency in the material relied on is accentuated in respect of those offences which occurred while he was in jail between April and August 2004.</text>

<tocase>Zoeller v Attorney-General (Cth) (1987) 16 FCR 153</tocase>
<text>109 Under the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (Cth), there was a similar time limit (of 45 days after arrest) imposed for the giving of a notice by the Attorney-General as is now contained in s 17. Beaumont J held that that time limit under the repealed Act did not prohibit the bringing of multiple, subsequent, applications for extradition: Zoeller v Attorney-General (Cth) (1987) 16 FCR 153 at 162. He suggested that if multiple applications were made a remedy could be sought by the person whose extradition was sought based on the power of the Court to prevent an abuse by the Attorney-General of the exercise of the power. The question presented here is different. There is no suggestion of abuse in Senator Johnston's issuing a new notice.

110 If Senator Ellison's notice could not be withdrawn, then its status at the time Senator Johnston gave his s 16 notice must be determined. If Senator Ellison's notice were wholly or partly valid, Senator Johnston would have power to amend it pursuant to s 10(4). But if Senator Ellison's s 16 notice were wholly invalid, the question arises as to Senator Johnston's power to issue an amended or a fresh notice in circumstances where Mr Tervonen would have been held in custody without the lawful authority of an existing and valid s 16 notice. To that matter I now turn.</text>
