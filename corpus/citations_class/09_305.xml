<tocase>Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309</tocase>
<text>In Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5 ; (2004) 218 CLR 366 ( Bashford ), Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ said in a joint judgment that the principles to be applied in determining whether an occasion of publication was one of qualified privilege are well known. Their Honours referred to Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 Cr M &amp; R 181 (149 ER 1044) and Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309. They quoted (at [9]) the following oft cited statement made by Parke B in Toogood v Spyring (at 193) (ER 1049-1050): 
 In general, an action lies for the malicious publication of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character of another (within the well-known limits as to verbal slander), and the law considers such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned. In such cases, the occasion prevents the inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorized communications, and affords a qualified defence depending upon the absence of actual malice. If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society ; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits. [my emphasis] 

 
Their Honours said (at [9]) that "[r]eciprocity of duty or interest is essential", citing Adam v Ward at 334 where the following statement appears:
 
 It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.</text>

<tocase>Baldry v Jackson [1976] 2 NSWLR 415</tocase>
<text>In response to Veda's Limitation Act defence submission, the applicants argue that all of the amendments to their respective pleadings take effect as from the filing of the original statement of claim (on 25 January 2006 in Mr McGary's proceeding and on 16 December 2005 in the other eight proceedings). The applicants refer to Baldry v Jackson [1976] 2 NSWLR 415 at 419 per Samuels JA, O 13 r 3A of the Federal Court Rules , and Vintage Developments Pty Ltd v GHD Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1437 ( Vintage ). The applicants submit: Where the limitation period of one year applies any pleaded imputation after 16 December 2005 is within time, and in the case of Mr McGary, any publication after 25 January 2006 . 
 If there is a publication prior to 16 February 2003 then any subsequent publication will be within time by virtue of the savings provisions under s 14B(2) of the Limitation Act when amended with effect from 17 February 2003. All publications are of substantially the same matter.
 All causes of action pleaded in defamation are publications within the twelve month period prior to the commencement of the proceedings or they come within the savings provision under s 14B(2) of the Limitation Act .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/5.html</AustLII>
<text>In Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5 ; (2004) 218 CLR 366 ( Bashford ), Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ said in a joint judgment that the principles to be applied in determining whether an occasion of publication was one of qualified privilege are well known. Their Honours referred to Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 Cr M &amp; R 181 (149 ER 1044) and Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309. They quoted (at [9]) the following oft cited statement made by Parke B in Toogood v Spyring (at 193) (ER 1049-1050):

In such cases, the occasion prevents the inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorized communications, and affords a qualified defence depending upon the absence of actual malice. If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society ; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits. [my emphasis] 

 
Their Honours said (at [9]) that "[r]eciprocity of duty or interest is essential", citing Adam v Ward at 334 where the following statement appears:
 
 It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.

I return now to Bashford (see [279] above).

In Bashford , the publisher of a trade newsletter was sued for defamation. The High Court held (5:2) that the occasion was one of qualified privilege. The reciprocity of duty or interest necessary to attract the defence existed because only persons responsible for occupational health and safety subscribed to the newsletter and it covered only that subject. The majority rejected a submission that qualified privilege was displaced because the newsletter was published for profit. Their Honours acknowledged that in Macintosh v Dun , the fact that the mercantile agency was in the business of providing information for profit appeared to have been an important consideration leading to denial of the defence of qualified privilege. However, they thought it would be wrong to isolate the element of profit and to conclude that its presence will necessarily always deny the availability of the defence. In relation to Macintosh v Dun , their Honours said (at [16]): 
 ... [F]urther elements were identified: the disclosure of confidential information would be sought, and it would likely be sought by means condemned as at least inappropriate, if not unlawful. While these further considerations were seen as following from the existence of the profit motive, they were considerations critical to the conclusion that the occasion was not privileged.

In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ thought it important to recognise that the Privy Council in Macintosh v Dun did not endorse the proposition that had been urged in the Full Court that payment for information necessarily denies that the occasion of its communication is privileged (at [20]). Similarly, their Honours considered that the Privy Council did not hold that the voluntary assumption of obligation (whether by contract or otherwise) was necessarily inconsistent with the existence of mutual duty or interest. Their Honours said (at [20]): 
 What distinguished Macintosh from Howe &amp; McColough was the nature of the information conveyed and the manner of its collection. In Macintosh information which included private or confidential material gathered from and about third parties was being conveyed; in Howe &amp; McColough , information about a transaction to which the maker of the statement was a party was passed on. In Macintosh , the fear was that inappropriate methods would be used to assemble the information; in Howe &amp; McColough , the person who made the communication already possessed relevant knowledge.

It is noteworthy that s 30(5) of the uniform Defamation Act 2005 now reflects the view expressed in Bashford that the defence of qualified privilege is not defeated simply by the fact that the defamatory matter is published for reward. Following their discussion of Macintosh v Dun , Bashford and the uniform Defamation Act 2005 , the learned authors: Trindade, Cane and Lunney, The Law of Torts in Australia (4 th Ed, OUP, 2007) have no hesitation in saying that "[t]he communications of credit agencies to their client will therefore now be regarded as being covered by this category of qualified privilege" (at [7.7.4.1.1] p 394). I agree: and consider that s 30(5) reflected, rather than changed, the law in this respect.</text>

<tocase>Dun v Macintosh [1906] HCA 24 ; (1906) 3 CLR 1134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1906/24.html</AustLII>
<text>On appeal to the High Court ( Dun v Macintosh [1906] HCA 24 ; (1906) 3 CLR 1134) the Supreme Court's decision on the question of privilege was affirmed. In separate judgments, Griffith CJ, Barton J and O'Connor J expressed agreement with Pring J's judgment in the Supreme Court.

The plaintiff, a grazier and stock dealer, sued a firm that had reported him to the secretary who had informed the other members accordingly. The High Court held (4:1) that the occasion was privileged. Macintosh v Dun was distinguished as turning on its own facts. Griffith CJ said (at 371) that the Privy Council had not professed to lay down any new rule, and had thought that the communication complained of was not to be seen as having been made in answer to an enquiry but as information volunteered. The Chief Justice also thought that their Lordships had considered the contract in Macintosh v Dun as "contrary to public policy" (at 371).

Barton J agreed with the Chief Justice.

O'Connor J also distinguished Macintosh v Dun as turning on the special circumstances under which it was claimed the privilege arose (at 373). His Honour characterised Macintosh v Dun as a case concerning an individual, association or corporation "that makes a business of collecting information about traders' credit and selling it for reward to other traders" (at 373). O'Connor J saw the real ground of the decision as residing in Lord Macnaghten's reference to "the interest of the community" and "the welfare of society" (see [295] above).

The evidence shows that Veda was incorporated on 12 December 1967 under the name "Credit Reference Association of New South Wales Limited", as a company limited by guarantee. It has had several changes of name (see [2] above). Until the 1990s it was an unlisted non-profit public company, but it then ceased to be a non-profit entity and also became a company limited by shares and guarantee. As at November 1995 it members were all credit providers. Although the memorandum and articles of association in evidence did not limit the membership to credit providers, I infer from their names that the signatories were in fact all credit providers. Veda's name was then "Credit Reference Association of Australia Limited".

Clause 7 of the memorandum of association provided: 
 (1) Each member, and each other person as the Directors determine, may upon agreeing to the terms, conditions and fees determined by the Directors, be entitled to obtain from the Company such information as may be in the possession of the Company, to the extent allowed by the law in any manner prescribed by the Directors as concerns the credit, insurance claims history or any commercial information in relation to any person. 

 
 (2) The Company shall not be obliged to receive information relating to any person otherwise than from members of the Company, and only to the extent allowed by the law, and in receiving, holding and supplying such information the Company shall at all times be acting as the agent of each member. 

 
 (3) The member agrees to indemnify the Company in respect of all: 

 
(a) demands, claims, actions, proceedings or suits brought against the Company, whether in law or in equity;
 
(b) liabilities of the Company; and
 
(c) costs and expenses including legal costs and expenses (on a solicitor and own client basis) incurred by the Company
 
 
arising directly or indirectly out of the use or reliance upon information supplied by or through the member to the Company, which is inaccurate for any reason, including because of error or omission.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1910/67.html</AustLII>
<text>In Australia, Macintosh v Dun was distinguished in Howe and McColough v Lees [1910] HCA 67 ; (1910) 11 CLR 361. That was a case of an association of stock salesmen who carried on business in the Bendigo sale-yards, and who, by the rules of the association, had contracted to inform the association's secretary of any person's failure to settle for stock purchased within a stipulated period.

It seems clear that if Veda had remained a mutual association it would have been indistinguishable for present purposes from the Association in Greenlands or from the association of stock salesmen in Howe and McColough v Lees . Senior counsel for Veda informed the Court that Veda "demutualised and became a public company in the late 1990s". He submits that it would be "incongruous" and would be "the sort of thing that brings the common law into disrepute" if such a change in formal status could cause Veda to lose the defence of qualified privilege.</text>

<tocase>Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] 2 WLR 248</tocase>
<text>Like Sullivan v Moody , Tame v New South Wales is unlike the present cases in that it was concerned with duties imposed by statute on persons who perform certain functions in the interests of the public or of a cross-section of it (for a recent illustration from the United Kingdom see Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] 2 WLR 248). However, I think that the approach taken in Tame v New South Wales is applicable. The defence of qualified privilege is made available because it is seen to be required in the public interest. It would introduce an incoherence in the law to impose a duty of care on Veda directed to the accuracy of its credit reports to enquiring credit providers. 2. Did Veda commit a breach of any duty of care it owed to the applicants in relation to the accuracy of the credit reports concerning them that caused those credit reports to be inaccurate?</text>

<tocase>London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15</tocase>
<text>The Privy Council's decision has been criticised. In Watt v Longsdon [1930] 1 KB 130 at 148, Scrutton LJ said that the decision "must not be relied on too strongly" in the light of the decision of the House of Lords in London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15 ( Greenlands ).

In Greenlands the House distinguished Macintosh v Dun . The case concerned the London Association for the Protection of Trade (Association) which had over 6,000 members who paid an annual subscription. A member (Kydd) applied to the Association on a form provided by it for information on the commercial standing of a trading company (Greenlands) with which Kydd proposed to deal. The secretary to the Association (Hadwen) applied to a commercial agent and debt collector (Wilmshurst) at Hereford where Greenlands carried on business for such information. Having obtained the information from Wilmshurst, Hadwen passed it onto Kydd. Greenlands sued Wilmshurst, the Association and Hadwen for libel.

A jury returned verdicts against all three defendants, finding express malice against Wilmshurst. The Association and Hadwen appealed. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial as against them.

On the further appeal to the House of Lords, Greenlands consented to have the judgment against the Association set aside because it transpired that it was an unincorporated association.

The point of distinction that seems to be common to their Lordships' speeches is that in Greenlands the Association was an unincorporated not-for-profit association who business was carried on by a committee, which did not operate solely from motives of pecuniary gain, and Hadwen did not act as agent of the Association but as agent of Kydd.

Their Lordships emphasised that whether qualified privilege was attracted depended on a close scrutiny of all the circumstances of the individual case.

The present cases share some features with both Macintosh v Dun and Greenlands . Like the defendants in Macintosh v Dun : Veda is motivated by the desire for pecuniary gain; Veda is not itself in the business of providing credit but is in the different business of collecting and providing, for reward to itself, creditworthiness information sought by credit providers. 
On the other hand, as in Greenlands :

It seems clear that if Veda had remained a mutual association it would have been indistinguishable for present purposes from the Association in Greenlands or from the association of stock salesmen in Howe and McColough v Lees . Senior counsel for Veda informed the Court that Veda "demutualised and became a public company in the late 1990s". He submits that it would be "incongruous" and would be "the sort of thing that brings the common law into disrepute" if such a change in formal status could cause Veda to lose the defence of qualified privilege.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/UKPCHCA/1908/3.html</AustLII>
<text>I referred to Veda's pleaded defence of qualified privilege at [116] above. The applicants submit that publication by Veda was not made on an occasion of qualified privilege. They rely on Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390. Veda submits that Macintosh v Dun was wrongly decided and should not be followed.

I turn now to Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390.

On appeal, the Privy Council ([1908] AC 390 at 400) referred to the facts that:

Their Lordships identified "the real question" as being whether it was "in the interests of the community" and "for the welfare of society" that the protection that the law gave to communications made in legitimate self-defence or from a bona fide sense of duty "should be extended to communications made from motives of self-interest by persons who trade for profit in the characters of other people" (at 400). Answering this question "no", they added: 
 But information such as that which [the defendants] offer for sale may be obtained in many ways, not all of them deserving of commendation. It may be extorted from the person whose character is in question through fear of misrepresentation or misconstruction if he remains silent. It may be gathered from gossip. It may be picked up from discharged servants. It may be betrayed by disloyal employees. It is only right that those who engage in such a business, touching so closely very dangerous ground, should take the consequences if they overstep the law.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2007/719.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicants do not submit that Veda was subject to the broad duty of care that I have described. They quoted from the following summary by McDougall J in OzEcom &amp; Anor v Hudson Investment Group &amp; Ors [2007] NSWSC 719 ( OzEcom ) at [321] of the elements of the cause of action in negligence causing pure economic loss extracted from recent High Court judgments: 
 (1) Reasonable foreseeability of loss is not of itself a sufficient basis to impose a duty of care: Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 at 329 [6] (Gleeson CJ; Tame was a case of alleged psychiatric injury, but what his Honour said applies a fortiori to a case of pure economic loss); Sullivan v Moody And Others [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at 576 [420] (another case of alleged psychiatric and other injury; the comment just made in relation to Tame applies). 

 
 (2) Nonetheless, reasonable foreseeability is a necessary condition of duty: Tame at 355 [103] (McHugh J). 

 
 (3) The absence of reasonable foreseeability negates the existence of a duty of care (following from (2)). 

 
 (4) A plaintiff's 'vulnerability', in the sense of its inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, is an important requirement in analysing whether any such duty of care is owed: Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd And Another [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at 530 [23] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). 

 
 (5) Another important consideration is assumption of responsibility coupled with known reliance: Woolcock Street at 531 [24] (ibid). 

 
 (6) The existence and terms of any relevant contract may bear upon the existence and content of a duty of care: Astley And Others v Austrust Limited [1999] HCA 6 ; (1999) 197 CLR 1 , 22 [47] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). To adapt the words of Lord Steyn (with whom the rest of the House of Lords agreed) in Williams And Another v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830 at 857, the role of the law of tort is to fill gaps where other remedies are not available. 

 
 (7) The relevant statutory and common law context, including the allocation of responsibilities and the provision of remedies, is relevant to the determination, whether a duty of care should be imposed in a particular case: Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 282 and 286 (Mc Hugh J [sic]); and see Perre And Others v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [5] (Gleeson CJ; his Honour repeated this sentiment in Tame at 329 [6]), 226 [120] (McHugh J)." 

 
As McDougall J acknowledged, the material relevant to the seven headings might overlap to some extent.

Veda responded to the applicants' submissions based on the passage from OzEcom set out at [379] above. I therefore turn now to the five elements summarised at [380] above. 1. Foreseeability of economic loss

As indicated earlier I am prepared to assume in favour of the applicants that it was reasonably foreseeable that if an inaccurate credit report was issued concerning them, they were likely to suffer economic loss. As also indicated earlier, the assumption may not be warranted. The question whether an applicant actually did suffer economic loss as a result of a particular inaccurate credit report would arise at the damages stage of these proceedings.</text>

As McDougall J acknowledged, the material relevant to the seven headings might overlap to some extent.

In Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 , a case concerning pure economic loss, Gummow J said (at [198]): 
 The question in the present case is whether the salient features of the matter gave rise to a duty of care owed by Apand. In determining whether the relationship is so close that the duty of care arises, attention is to be paid to the particular connections between the parties. ... There is no simple formula which can mask the necessity for examination of the particular facts.

In its submissions, Veda summarised " the particular facts" in the present cases as follows: 
 [ 18 ] (a) the Respondent operates a credit reporting business regulated by the Privacy Act 1988 ; 

 
 (b) the business involves entering into contracts with subscribers for provision to them of the services provided by the Respondent, pursuant to which the subscribers are obligated to report credit defaults to the Respondent by posting such reports on the Respondent's database for the benefit of other subscribers; 

 
 (c) the legislation places restrictions on the type of credit information which credit providers are permitted to post onto the database and imposes certain obligations on both the Respondent and the credit providers to take steps to ensure the credit information on the credit file was accurate; 

 
 (d) the Respondent maintains the database but does not control the posting of information onto the database or when the information on credit files is posted onto the database; the manner in which consumer credit information is posted onto the database is controlled by the Act; 

 
 (e) the Respondent has no contractual or other pre-existing relations with the persons the subject of credit files on the database, and has no knowledge of their personal or financial circumstances; 

 
 (f) while the subscribers could be said to rely on the credit information which they are provided with, the persons subject to credit files held on the database do not rely on the credit files in any direct or conscious way, though they may be aware of their existence; 

 
 (g) so far as the evidence in these proceedings revealed, the Applicants did not seek to access their credit files, or concern themselves with their contents, until after they became aware that the files may contain information which was interfering with them obtaining credit; 

 
 (h) the posting of default information onto credit files can be done via the internet in a manual fashion, but overwhelmingly is done by automated computer downloads with minimal human intervention at the credit provider end and none at the Respondent's end under either process the Respondent does not see the default information before it is registered onto the credit files; 

 
 (i) the Respondent has no direct knowledge of the default information which subscribers post on the database the subscribers are the controllers and source of that information which they create in their own business records; the subscribers have similar, if not more onerous, obligations as to accuracy of the information imposed on them by the legislation; 

 
 (j) the Respondent does not trigger or control when the access is made to the database; it is a contractual obligation to make the credit information placed on there by credit providers available at all times to other credit provider subscribers; 

 
 (k) the Respondent does not use the information for any purpose it is a passive repository for the credit information, akin to a notice board or clearing house for the benefit of third parties; 

 
 (l) the obligations imposed on the Respondent under the legislation in relation to prevention of inaccurate or misleading credit information are limited to reasonable steps and reacting once it becomes aware of inaccuracies; 

 
 (m) the purpose of enquiries of the credit files by subscribers is to assist them in assessing credit applications by members of the public; at the time of such credit enquiries the Respondent has no knowledge of the particular application or the reasons for it; 

 
 (n) a refusal of credit may or may not involve the applicant for credit in suffering financial harm; 

 
 (o) the Respondent carries out various activities designed to correct alleged inaccuracies in credit information on the database, including training credit provider's employees, audit procedures, and complaints handling and investigation on behalf of members of the public, all within the restrictions on disclosing personal information imposed on the Respondent by the legislation; 

 
 (p) as the Applicants concede, the provision of credit reporting services by the Respondent is of significant social and economic utility in enabling members of the public to obtain appropriate credit quickly and safely and at reasonable cost.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/59.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicants do not submit that Veda was subject to the broad duty of care that I have described. They quoted from the following summary by McDougall J in OzEcom &amp; Anor v Hudson Investment Group &amp; Ors [2007] NSWSC 719 ( OzEcom ) at [321] of the elements of the cause of action in negligence causing pure economic loss extracted from recent High Court judgments: 
 (1) Reasonable foreseeability of loss is not of itself a sufficient basis to impose a duty of care: Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 at 329 [6] (Gleeson CJ; Tame was a case of alleged psychiatric injury, but what his Honour said applies a fortiori to a case of pure economic loss); Sullivan v Moody And Others [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at 576 [420] (another case of alleged psychiatric and other injury; the comment just made in relation to Tame applies). 

 
 (2) Nonetheless, reasonable foreseeability is a necessary condition of duty: Tame at 355 [103] (McHugh J). 

 
 (3) The absence of reasonable foreseeability negates the existence of a duty of care (following from (2)). 

 
 (4) A plaintiff's 'vulnerability', in the sense of its inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, is an important requirement in analysing whether any such duty of care is owed: Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd And Another [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at 530 [23] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). 

 
 (5) Another important consideration is assumption of responsibility coupled with known reliance: Woolcock Street at 531 [24] (ibid). 

 
 (6) The existence and terms of any relevant contract may bear upon the existence and content of a duty of care: Astley And Others v Austrust Limited [1999] HCA 6 ; (1999) 197 CLR 1 , 22 [47] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). To adapt the words of Lord Steyn (with whom the rest of the House of Lords agreed) in Williams And Another v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830 at 857, the role of the law of tort is to fill gaps where other remedies are not available. 

 
 (7) The relevant statutory and common law context, including the allocation of responsibilities and the provision of remedies, is relevant to the determination, whether a duty of care should be imposed in a particular case: Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 282 and 286 (Mc Hugh J [sic]); and see Perre And Others v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 192 [5] (Gleeson CJ; his Honour repeated this sentiment in Tame at 329 [6]), 226 [120] (McHugh J)." 

 
As McDougall J acknowledged, the material relevant to the seven headings might overlap to some extent.

It must be emphasised that foreseeability of economic loss is only the beginning of the enquiry as to whether a duty of care exists: see, for example, Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [42] .

The method of posing the foreseeability question is not free of difficulty. I have expressed it as relating to the foreseeability of economic harm arising from the provision of an inaccurate credit report to an enquiring credit provider. However, an alternative is to express it as the foreseeability of economic harm arising from a failure by Veda to take certain steps by way of training or warning or monitoring subscribers with a view to ensuring that they enter only accurate data into the database. I am prepared to assume that it was foreseeable that in the case of some listing credit providers there would be some steps in the nature of training, warning or monitoring that might prevent an inaccurate listing of a default which was likely to cause an individual economic loss. Much would depend on the extent, persistence and intensity of the training, warning and monitoring, and on the particular credit provider's desire to cooperate. I should make it clear that the extent, persistence and intensity of the training, warning and monitoring may need to be very great indeed. It may even require Veda to assume the role of a day to day enforcement authority with a presence in the credit provider's business establishment, in order to exclude the possibility of inaccurate listings. 2. Vulnerability of the loss sufferer

The applicants were not powerless in relation to the information recorded in their credit information files maintained by Veda. Section 18H of the Privacy Act gave them a right of access to their file and s 18J entitled them to have Veda make appropriate corrections, deletions or additions to ensure that information in their file was accurate, up-to-date, complete and not misleading, or, if Veda did not do so, to have it include a statement in their credit information file.

Veda submits that the general law background to Part IIIA of the Privacy Act also tells against the imposition of a duty of care of the kind that the applicants must establish. Veda refers to the law relating to defamation and to statements by the High Court in Sullivan v Moody and Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 , generally to the effect that a duty of care will not be recognised where its recognition would render the common law incoherent. In particular, Veda relies on the defence of qualified privilege claims in defamation a defence that is made available in the public interest. The defence is made available by the common law when a credit reporting agency provides an inaccurate credit report to a credit provider. It is argued that it would be destructive of that defence if the same common law were to impose a duty of care on the credit reporting agency as the foundation for a liability in negligence.

Sullivan v Moody was concerned with notifications by various categories of professional persons to the authorities of suspicions on reasonable grounds that certain offences had been committed against children. Certain medical practitioners and social workers employed by the South Australian Department of Community Welfare issued reports to the authorities that certain children had been sexually abused. The fathers of the children alleged that as a result of negligent examination, diagnosis and reporting by those professional persons, they, the fathers, had suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and resultant personal and financial loss.

The High Court held that it would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of the professional or statutory responsibilities of those involved in investigating and reporting upon alleged sexual abuse, for them to be subjected to a legal duty to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of the harm. Their Honours emphasised (at [42]) that foreseeability of harm to the fathers was not sufficient to ground a duty of care.

Sullivan v Moody is not on all fours with the present case because it involved a statutorily imposed duty on the professional persons to provide reports. There is no duty imposed by the Privacy Act on Veda to engage in its credit reporting business.

Notwithstanding this difference, in my view Sullivan v Moody gives guidance in the circumstances of the present cases. The passage from Sullivan v Moody quoted above is not expressed to depend on the imposition of the reporting duty by statute, or on the "professional" responsibilities of the medical practitioner and social workers. Rather, the passage addresses the relationship between the imposition of a duty of care and the existence of the defence of qualified privilege.

Once I have held that even an inaccurate defamatory credit report issued by Veda does not expose it to liability for defamation by reason of the defence of qualified privilege, it would introduce incoherence in the common law to impose a duty of care. Veda would, contrary to the convenience of the community and welfare of society that give rise to the defence, be inhibited in passing on the creditworthiness information in its database to those who have a legitimate interest in receiving it.

At [28], Gleeson CJ stated (citations omitted): ... as in Sullivan v Moody , this is a case where the appellant claims to have been injured in consequence of what others were told about her. There is the same intersection with the law of defamation, and the same need to preserve legal coherence ... In the events that occurred, Mrs Tame's reputation was not harmed. But suppose it had been. Then the law would have engaged in an exercise of balancing the rights and responsibilities of Mrs Tame and Acting Sergeant Beardsley by reference to considerations many of which would be rendered irrelevant by the application of the law of negligence. 
 
Similarly, Gaudron J stated (at [58] citations omitted):
 The second matter which indicates that Acting Sergeant Beardsley did not owe a duty of care to Mrs Tame is the fact that the direct cause of her psychiatric illness was not the inaccurate recording of her blood alcohol level, but its communication to others. Thus, in this case as in Sullivan v Moody , "there is an intersection with the law of defamation which resolves the competing interests of the parties through well-developed principles about privilege and the like" ... And as in Sullivan v Moody , "[t]o apply the law of negligence in the present case would resolve that competition on an altogether different basis". At the very least, the law of negligence with respect to psychiatric injury ought not be extended in a disconformity with other areas of the law.
 
McHugh J observed (at [122] and [123] citations omitted):
 Mrs Tame's psychiatric illness is the product of her concern for her reputation. There is no doubt that the publication of the P4 report to the insurer defamed her. She could have sued for damages for defamation. If successful, she could have recovered all the damages in that action that she sought in the present action including damages for her psychiatric illness. 
 In determining whether Acting Sergeant Beardsley owed a duty of care to Mrs Tame, it is proper to take into account quite apart from the issue of reasonable foreseeability that the law of defamation appears a more appropriate medium for dealing with the facts of her case than the law of negligently inflicted nervous shock. Her action arises out of a communication to a third party, her concern is with her reputation and the law of defamation has various defences that reconcile the competing interests of the parties more appropriately than the law of negligence. This Court has already taken the view that, independently of policy issues relevant to the interests of the parties and persons like them, the need for the law to be coherent is a relevant factor in determining whether a duty exists. In Sullivan v Moody , ... the Court said that coherence in the law was a relevant factor in determining whether a duty of care existed. In Sullivan , the Court held that officers of the Department of Community Welfare owed no duty of care to a person affected by a communication made as the result of investigating, under a statutory power, a sexual assault allegation.
 
Finally, Callinan J, (at [323], [325]) stated (citations omitted):
 Whilst it may be accepted that a plaintiff is entitled to avail herself of whatever remedies are available to her, it is important that a decision and the reasoning leading to it, in an unusual case, which this one is, be in harmony with, so far as is possible, available related causes of action, and the common law as a whole or, as it was put by this Court in Sullivan v Moody , ... that they not offend the "coherence of the law". The facts of this case might conceivably have given rise to actions in negligent misstatement (if that action is not confined to claims for economic loss) and defamation. That these causes of action may also be available on the facts of the case, and would then be governed by special rules affected by policy considerations, is relevant to the question whether the appellant should recover damages for "nervous shock" on the basis of those facts. As to the former cause of action, Barwick CJ in Mutual Life &amp; Citizens' Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt ... said: 
 "But I think it is quite clear that the relationship of proximity, adequate for compensation of injury caused by physical acts or omissions, would be inappropriate in the case of utterance by way of information or advice which causes loss or damage. The necessary relationship in that connexion must needs be more specific." 
 ... 

 Many controls and special defences, both statutory and at common law, ordinarily operate to restrict claims in defamation; for example, defences of qualified and absolute privilege, and the need for a plaintiff to prove absence of good faith on the part of the defendant.

Like Sullivan v Moody , Tame v New South Wales is unlike the present cases in that it was concerned with duties imposed by statute on persons who perform certain functions in the interests of the public or of a cross-section of it (for a recent illustration from the United Kingdom see Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] 2 WLR 248). However, I think that the approach taken in Tame v New South Wales is applicable. The defence of qualified privilege is made available because it is seen to be required in the public interest. It would introduce an incoherence in the law to impose a duty of care on Veda directed to the accuracy of its credit reports to enquiring credit providers. 2. Did Veda commit a breach of any duty of care it owed to the applicants in relation to the accuracy of the credit reports concerning them that caused those credit reports to be inaccurate?</text>

As McDougall J acknowledged, the material relevant to the seven headings might overlap to some extent.

Veda submits that the general law background to Part IIIA of the Privacy Act also tells against the imposition of a duty of care of the kind that the applicants must establish. Veda refers to the law relating to defamation and to statements by the High Court in Sullivan v Moody and Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 , generally to the effect that a duty of care will not be recognised where its recognition would render the common law incoherent. In particular, Veda relies on the defence of qualified privilege claims in defamation a defence that is made available in the public interest. The defence is made available by the common law when a credit reporting agency provides an inaccurate credit report to a credit provider. It is argued that it would be destructive of that defence if the same common law were to impose a duty of care on the credit reporting agency as the foundation for a liability in negligence.

Tame v New South Wales is the second case relied on by Veda. Ms Tame was the driver of a car that was involved in a traffic accident. She had a nil blood alcohol level, but when completing a report on the accident, a police officer mistakenly recorded that her blood alcohol level was 0.14. While the error was subsequently noticed and corrected, a copy of the uncorrected report was provided to the insurer which was handling Ms Tame's claim against the nominal defendant in respect of the accident. The insurer nevertheless admitted liability.

Some time after the accident Ms Tame's solicitor told her about the entry concerning her blood alcohol level in the police report that had been given to the insurer. The police confirmed that the entry was wrong and they apologised. The insurer confirmed that liability for the accident was admitted. Nonetheless, Ms Tame became obsessed with the mistake that the police had made and ultimately developed a psychiatric disorder. She sued the State, claiming that it was vicariously liable for the negligence of the police officer.

The High Court held that the police officer had not owed a duty to take reasonable care to avoid psychiatric injury to Ms Tame.

Like Sullivan v Moody , Tame v New South Wales is unlike the present cases in that it was concerned with duties imposed by statute on persons who perform certain functions in the interests of the public or of a cross-section of it (for a recent illustration from the United Kingdom see Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] 2 WLR 248).

<tocase>Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 Cr M &amp; R 181 (149 ER 1044)</tocase>
<text>In Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 5 ; (2004) 218 CLR 366 ( Bashford ), Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ said in a joint judgment that the principles to be applied in determining whether an occasion of publication was one of qualified privilege are well known. Their Honours referred to Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 Cr M &amp; R 181 (149 ER 1044) and Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309. They quoted (at [9]) the following oft cited statement made by Parke B in Toogood v Spyring (at 193) (ER 1049-1050): 
 In general, an action lies for the malicious publication of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character of another (within the well-known limits as to verbal slander), and the law considers such publication as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned. In such cases, the occasion prevents the inference of malice, which the law draws from unauthorized communications, and affords a qualified defence depending upon the absence of actual malice. If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society ; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits. [my emphasis] 

 
Their Honours said (at [9]) that "[r]eciprocity of duty or interest is essential", citing Adam v Ward at 334 where the following statement appears:
 
 It was not disputed, in this case on either side, that a privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.</text>

 If there is a publication prior to 16 February 2003 then any subsequent publication will be within time by virtue of the savings provisions under s 14B(2) of the Limitation Act when amended with effect from 17 February 2003. All publications are of substantially the same matter.
 All causes of action pleaded in defamation are publications within the twelve month period prior to the commencement of the proceedings or they come within the savings provision under s 14B(2) of the Limitation Act .

Veda submits that Vintage is distinguishable because the application in that case was an application to amend the capacity in which a party sued under O 13 r 2(6). However, Veda submits that O 13 r 2(6) is also subject to O 13 r 2(3)'s requirement of leave where the limitation period has expired, and that the correctness of Vintage is doubtful because the parties did not refer Her Honour to O 13 r 2(3).

The parties' submissions raised two issues for decision. The first relates to the construction and application of s 14B(2003). The second relates to the construction and application of O 13 rr 2 and 3A of the Federal Court Rules .

Both issues were argued by reference to general principles, and I will decide them accordingly, leaving it to the parties to apply my decision to the nine individual proceedings. Section 14B(2003)

Vintage does not assist one way or the other. In that case the applicants moved under O 13 r 2 for leave to amend, and regard was had to subrules (3) and (6) of that rule and to rule 3A. With respect, Bennett J correctly observed (at [20]) that the effect of rule 3A(1)(b) was that if the Court did not otherwise order when granting leave to amend under O 13 r 2, the amendment would take effect when the document the subject of the amendment was first filed.

Rule 3A is a default provision. When dealing with an application under rule 3 for leave to amend, the Court must bear in mind that unless it orders otherwise, rule 3A will have effect.

Since I have decided that s 14B(2003) did not apply, I need say nothing further in relation to O 13 r 2 and 3A of the Federal Court Rules .</text>

<tocase>Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394</tocase>
<text>Prior to the amendment of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA Act) by the insertion of subs (2B) in s 59 by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (No 84 of 1994), it was generally accepted that the Court could not, under its rule-making power, deprive a litigant of the benefit of a limitation defence. This idea can be traced back to Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394 ; and see the annotations to O 13 r 2 in Practice &amp; Procedure High Court and Federal Court of Australia at [40,455.15].

Subsection (2B) was introduced into s 59 of the FCA Act on 23 June 1994. It provides: 
 The Rules of Court may make provision for: 
 (a) the amendment of a document in a proceeding; or
 (b) leave to amend a document in a proceeding;
 even if the effect of the amendment would be to allow a person to seek a remedy in respect of a legal or equitable claim that would have been barred because of the expiry of a period of limitation if the remedy had originally been sought at the time of the amendment.

Pursuant to this amendment, O 13 r 2 was amended on 1 August 1994 by Statutory Rules 279 of 1994. The amendments substituted a new subrule (3) of rule 2 and added new subrules (4), (5), (6) and (7) to that rule.</text>
