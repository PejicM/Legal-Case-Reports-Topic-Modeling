<text>2 The federal magistrate had previously dealt with the matter in a way which was beneficial to the applicant. However, that initial determination was set aside by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 171 ; (2008) 245 ALR 501. In the first of his judgments the learned federal magistrate had determined that the applicant was entitled to prerogative writs on the basis of the fraud of a migration agent. He was able to identify sufficient elements in the evidence before him to make good that determination of fraud. The Full Court held that the evidence which was before the federal magistrate could not, at the requisite Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 standard, make good the fraud allegation. The Court remitted the matter back to the federal magistrate to be determined in accordance with its reasons. The federal magistrate then conducted a rehearing. At the rehearing, some additional material was placed before the federal magistrate. Some of that material was accepted. Part of that material was rejected.</text>

<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>8 The primary application before me is, of course, an application pursuant to Order 52 rule 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules to allow the filing and service of the notice of appeal out of time. That rule is only activated if there are present special reasons. What is connoted by the concept of special reasons is discussed in the Full Court's decision in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 in the following terms:
 
... an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served.

9 I do not think that the explanation which has been proffered for the delay constitutes special circumstances. The affidavit material proffered by the applicant this morning did not disclose anything other than that he had missed the time limit because he had made an ongoing ministerial intervention request. That would not constitute a special reason. The mere fact that one avenue is being pursued does not justify not pursuing another. Certainly, even to the extent that it could, that extent could not be described as constituting special reasons.

10 When the matter came before me this morning the applicant also relied on some correspondence which was tendered. That correspondence does not establish anything other than that he sought to withdraw his application for a bridging visa. That does not constitute special reasons or, indeed, any reasons at all. In all those circumstances, but particularly having regard to the apparent futility of the proposed appeal, it is inappropriate to exercise the discretion in the applicant's favour. It follows that the application for an extension of time pursuant to Order 52 rule 15(2) must be dismissed.</text>
