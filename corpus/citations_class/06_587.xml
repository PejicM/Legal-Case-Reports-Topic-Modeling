<tocase>Craine v Colonial and Mutual Life Fire Insurance Company Limited [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1920/64.html</AustLII>
<text>39 As Isaacs J observed giving the judgment of the Court in Craine v Colonial and Mutual Life Fire Insurance Company Limited [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305 at 326:
 
 '"Waiver" is a doctrine of some arbitrariness introduced by the law to prevent a man in certain circumstances from taking up two inconsistent positions (see per James L.J. in Pilcher v. Rawlins (7 Ch App 259, at pp. 268 et seqq)). It is a conclusion of law when the necessary facts are established. It looks, however, chiefly to the conduct and position of the person who is said to have waived, in order to see whether he has "approbated" so as to prevent him from "reprobating"--in English terms, whether he has elected to get some advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled, so as to deny to him a later election to the contrary (see per Lord Shaw in Pitman v. Crum Ewing ((1911) AC 217, at p. 239)). His knowledge is necessary, or he cannot be said to have approbated or elected.'

40 This, of course, is not a case of election per se but it is a case in which the appellant sought to get from the Tribunal the benefit of having his new migration agent act for him, apparently on the evidence, by instructing that agent to seek an adjournment. Such was Mr Sardar's request of 28 April 2003.

41 I think that if the appellant wants to rely on that request having been made for an adjournment, as having been one which the Tribunal should have taken notice of, he must accept that it was reasonable for the Tribunal in the circumstances to take Mr Sardar as being the person authorised to receive communications in response to that request, including a rejection and to leave it to him to communicate with the appellant about it. Therefore, in addition to the reasons that his Honour gave for rejecting the argument concerning the refusal of the adjournment for these additional reasons above, I would also refuse that ground of appeal. I hasten to add that I agree with his Honour's analysis and the analysis for rejecting that ground as an independent ground.

42 The appellant argued that the letter of 31 March 2003 was not signed by a person within the meaning of s 407 of the Act, being a Registrar of the Tribunal, a Deputy Registrar or other officer of the Tribunal. In my opinion this ground is without substance. The letter stated that there was a contact officer, Ms Flores, who I infer, pursuant to my powers under the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) from the form of the document was authorised to send the document. It is a business record. It records accurately that Ms Flores was an officer of the Tribunal as it stated. She was the person who sent the document or on whose behalf it was sent. Therefore it was a document that emanated from an officer of the Tribunal. I reject the ground of appeal that asserts to the contrary.

43 Next it was argued that there was non-compliance with the statutory regime prescribed by Division 4, Part 7 of the Act in relation to the way in which the letter of 31 March 2003 notified the hearing. It is necessary to set out the relevant sections of the Act, namely ss 425, 425A, 426A and 427(1): 
 
 
 S 425 
 ' Tribunal must invite applicant to appear 
 
 
 (1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. 
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if: 
 
 (a) the Tribunal considers that it should decide the review in the applicant's favour on the basis of the material before it: or 
 (b) the applicant consents to the Tribunal deciding the review without the applicant appearing before it: or 
 (c) subsection 424C(1) or (2) applies to the applicant. 
 
 
 
 (3) If any of the paragraphs in subsection (2) of this section apply, the applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal. 
 
 
 
 S 425A 
 Notice of invitation to appear 
 
 
 (1) If the applicant is invited to appear before the Tribunal, the Tribunal must give the applicant notice of the day on which, and the time and place at which, the applicant is scheduled to appear. 
 
 
 
 (2) The notice must be given to the applicant: 
 (a) except where paragraph (b) applies by one of the methods specified in section 441A; or 
 (b) if the applicant is in immigration detention by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving documents to such a person. 
 
 
 
 
 (3) The period of notice given must be at least the prescribed period or, if no period is prescribed, a reasonable period. 
 
 
 
 (4) The notice must contain a statement of the effect of section 426A. 
 
 
 
 S 426A 
 Failure of applicant to appear before Tribunal 
 
 
 (1) If the applicant: 
 
 
 
 (a) is invited under section 425 to appear before the Tribunal; and 
 (b) does not appear before the Tribunal on the day on which, or at the time and place at which, the applicant is scheduled to appear; 
 
 the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it. 
 
 
 (2) This section does not prevent the Tribunal from rescheduling the applicant's appearance before it, or from delaying its decision on the review in order to enable the applicant's appearance before it as rescheduled. 
 
 
 
 S 427 
 Powers of the Refugee Review Tribunal etc. 
 
 
 (1) For the purpose of the review of a decision, the Tribunal may: 
 
 
 
 (a) take evidence on oath or affirmation; or 
 
 
 
 (b) adjourn the review from time to time; or 
 
 
 
 
 (c) subject to sections 438 and 440, give information to the applicant and to the Secretary; or 
 
 
 
 (d) require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation, or any medical examination, that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review, and to give to the Tribunal a report of that investigation or examination.'</text>

<tocase>Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/57.html</AustLII>
<text>59 Counsel for the appellant argued that what had been said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 117 [82] - [83] was apposite and that I should have regard to the fact that in that case a 4-month delay was not seen as disqualifying the prosecutor from relief to which she would otherwise have been entitled after jurisdictional error had been established.

60 In my opinion the facts in that case are quite remote from the facts in the present case. In this case it seems to me that the delays, in the history that I have set out, are substantial. They have no substantive meritorious explanation that would weigh the exercise of my discretion to ignore them to allow points which might be argued in favour of the appellant, including an error I found under s 424A, and the possible constructional error of some nicety in relation to the notification provisions, to be addressed. Both the error in relation to s 424A and possible error to which I have adverted are not, in my opinion, an injustice sufficient to overcome the delay of the appellant in this case.

61 I can take into account in considering that there is substantial unexplained delay or inadequately explained delay after many applications to the Court as in this case, as a matter to affect the exercise of my discretion. However, I am not going to do that in this particular case.

62 In my opinion there is a public interest in finality of litigation. It is important that litigants know that Courts are here to administer justice fairly and impartially, but once their cases have been heard or the procedures of the law have been put in motion and the litigants have had adequate opportunity to appear and present their cases and do not take the opportunity up for reasons which are not substantial enough, it is wrong to put the other party or parties to further expense by allowing the litigation to proceed.

63 It seems to me that it would be quite unfair to the respondent Minister, in this case having been engaged now in the fifth separate application to the Court, that the appellant has made, bearing in mind there were applications that were disposed of by Stone J, Emmett J the High Court and the trial Judge below and now by me, to decide this case on new arguments which are presented on the appeal for the first time to suggest errors in what had happened when the matter was heard by the Tribunal in 2003.

64 I see no error in the way that his Honour would have exercised his discretion had there been a jurisdictional error. But for the reasons that I have given, I am of the opinion that no adequate explanation for the delay has been given and that the interests of justice would not be served having regard to the delays with or without any such explanation by granting prerogative relief. I would refuse to exercise my discretion even were I satisfied that there were an additional error, to the one I have identified, in the new argument about notification sought to be raised.

65 I do not think that this case is a proper vehicle in which those arguments should be raised. The appellant had the opportunity to put fully his case to the Tribunal, in writing, in his application for review. He did not do so. He had the opportunity to attend and give evidence to the Tribunal, albeit that there is some explanation for his not doing so, the fact is he did not give his account to the Tribunal in writing even after the scheduled but unattended hearing. Maybe that was a result of his being unrepresented; that will enable him to have his remedies against whoever gave him bad advice.

66 In my opinion, the consequences of that bad advice should not be visited in the circumstances of this case on the respondents. The explanations, such as they are, that have been given do not satisfy me that in the exercise of my discretion I should grant relief. In my opinion the appeal should be should be dismissed with costs.

67 The Minister has asked that I fix $5500 as the amount of the costs to which, in an order for costs, she would be entitled. I am of the opinion that that is a reasonable sum and it is appropriate, in the exercise of my discretion, that I do fix it. Accordingly the orders I make are the appeal is dismissed; the appellant is to pay the costs of the first respondent in the sum of $5500.
 


 I certify that the preceding sixty seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In substance, what was asserted in the submissions considered by his Honour was that the invitation to a hearing in the letter of 31 March 2003 did not comply with the statutory requirements of the Act as it failed to give a prescribed notification period to the applicant. That ground has not been pressed, as I understood the argument today before me. Next the appellant submitted that the Tribunal had failed to give a prescribed notification period under s 425A(3) to him and therefore by reason of the decision of the High Court in SAAP v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 there was a jurisdictional error.

30 His Honour noted that the Minister's submissions pointed out that the contravention of s 425A(3) alleged then was that the appellant had got more than the prescribed statutory period of notice. His Honour then noted submissions on the merits that the applicant had made to him. His Honour considered and rejected the argument that there had been a non-compliance with s 424A in relation to the material in [36] of the Tribunal's reasons. However, I think that argument was well-founded and the trial judge erred in rejecting it. His Honour dismissed the argument on the basis that [36] was not 'integral' to the Tribunal's reasoning process. In my opinion, that is unlikely to be correct because of the way in which the Tribunal expressed its reasons. In [36], it stated that its earlier conclusion (that in light of the consideration that the material put forward by the applicant for review did not justify a finding that he was the subject of persecution for his political activities or that there was a real chance of him being persecuted if returned to India) was supported by the travel activities of the appellant which led to the final conclusions in [37] and [38].

48 The appellant says that by failing to notify the appellant in the letter of 31 March 2003 of the effect of s 426(2) the Tribunal fell into the same kind of jurisdictional error as occurred in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162. It was said that one of the purposes of the requirement of giving notice was to ensure that the natural justice to which the appellant was entitled by force of s 422B(1) would be provided and any failure to adhere strictly to this code constituted a jurisdictional error.

56 I do not think there was any injustice whatsoever in the failure to tell the appellant of the travel matters, the subject of [36] of the Tribunal's reason. In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, it was held that where jurisdictional error occurs, it is not a proper basis, in the exercise of discretion, to refuse relief because to do so would be in the opinion of the Court futile or that the case is so weak that it does not warrant appellate intervention.

57 However, the critical passages in that case, for present purposes are what the majority said about the issue of discretion in a case where, unlike that case, there had been delay or other circumstances which would actuate the exercise of the discretion. McHugh J said, 215 ALR 183-184 [80]:
 
 '[80] The issuing of writs under s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act is discretionary. Discretionary relief may be refused under s 39B if the conduct of the party is inconsistent with the application for relief. It may be inconsistent, for example, if there is delay on the part of the applicant or the applicant has waived or acquiesced in the invalidity of the decision or does not come with clean hands. Discretionary relief may also be refused if the applicant has in fact suffered no injustice, for example, because the statutory law compels a particular outcome.'

58 Hayne J, with whom Kirby J on this point expressly agreed 215 ALR 203 [174], said at 215 ALR 212 [211]:
 
 'For the reasons given earlier the decision reached by the tribunal is invalid. There is no basis, in this case, on which the undoubted discretion to refuse relief sought should be exercised against its grant. There has been no suggestion of delay, waiver, acquiescence or other conduct of the appellant said to stand in their way.'</text>

<tocase>SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/2.html</AustLII>
<text>15 I note that in [36] of the Tribunal's reasons there is material that was not submitted for the purposes of the review, within the meaning of the authorities, especially SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2.

16 Dissatisfied with this result, the appellant applied to this Court for judicial review by an application filed on 19 June 2003. The grounds for review in the application made to the Court on that occasion did not assert that the appellant had been aggrieved by the failure of the Tribunal to hear him give evidence. The grounds of review asserted, relevantly, that the Tribunal had affirmed the decision of the Department, the appellant was aggrieved by that; the Tribunal had failed to take into consideration the merits of the case; it had failed to act on proper principles of fairness and natural justice and it did not act in good faith to make the decision.

17 Grounds for those contentions were set out as being: the decision made by the Tribunal was an improper exercise of the powers conferred by the Act and the regulations and it involved an error of law, being an incorrect interpretation of the applicable laws and the incorrect application of the law to the facts. The application did not get any more specific than that.

31 In SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs , [2006] FCAFC 2 Allsop J at [233], with whom Weinberg J agreed at [155], said that if it could be shown that a reason given by the Tribunal for affirming the decision under review which failed to follow the procedure mandated by section 424A was entirely independent of another basis which did not fall foul of any jurisdictional error, the independent basis could support the decision under review notwithstanding the other jurisdictional error.

32 The appellant also argued to his Honour that he had not been given an opportunity to give evidence at the hearing before the Tribunal. His Honour concluded that it was open to the Tribunal to refuse the request for the adjournment that had been made by Mr Sardar and, inter alia, adopted the opinion expressed by McHugh and Heydon JJ in their reasons for refusing special leave which I have set out above.</text>

<tocase>SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/93.html</AustLII>
<text>33 An applicant for review is bound by the way in which his agent acts on his behalf even though the agent may do things that cause the applicant to be unaware of what is happening. As Jacobson J said in SZEYH v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 at [25] : 
 
 'In NADK of (2002) v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 a Full Court dealt with a claim by an applicant that his migration agent did not notify him of the hearing. The Full Court concluded at [16] that " the asserted fact that the applicant was unaware of the Tribunal's hearing was of no legal relevance" .'

34 I do not see any error in what his Honour said. However, the appellant argued that because of the irregularity of what purported to be the appellant's signature on the form 956 sent in by Mr Sardar on 28 April 2006, the Tribunal ought to have realised that the appellant had not authorised Mr Sardar to receive communications and then in some way it should then have not merely communicated with Mr Sardar or perhaps not communicated with him at all but sought to communicate with the appellant. A number of hurdles appear to this argument.

35 The first involves the fact the appellant, on the material before the Court, namely that I have set out, appeared to authorise Mr Sardar to make the application. There is no evidence that his signature is a forgery. I accept the signature looks different. I have already dealt with an application to adduce further evidence on appeal and rejected it for reasons I gave earlier today. Accordingly, on the material before me, in the conduct of this appeal, there is no evidence that the signature, albeit that it was different to the ordinary signature appearing on other documents at least that the Tribunal had before it, would have, in the ordinary course, been looked at by the Tribunal as being or be thought by it to be anything other than regular.

36 Secondly, the appellant sought an adjournment from the Tribunal which was rejected. Communication of the rejection was made to the agent. If Mr Sardar, was unauthorised, to be the appellant's agent because the signature on the form 956 was a forgery or if the Tribunal had accepted the reasoning which I am asked to accept that a glance at the form 956 would have shown Mr Sardar had put forward a signature that could not be relied on as that of the appellant, then communications with him should have been of no moment to the Tribunal. The fact is Mr Jivani was previously notified of the hearing and had sent back, as recently as 17 April 2003, a form of response to an invitation to hearing indicating that the appellant knew of the hearing and wished to give evidence. Mr Jivani had not sought any adjournment.

37 A party is not entitled to blow hot and cold about a position such as that which is relied on here. What the appellant is seeking to do is approbate the application for an adjournment as being made on his behalf but reprobate its source, namely Mr Sardar. Albeit this is an application for judicial review, it is difficult to understand why a person in the position of the Tribunal, having received an application for adjournment apparently made on behalf of the appellant and having communicated the refusal of that application to the person who made it, should be bound to go behind that communication and communicate directly with the appellant in the circumstances of the notification of the application at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon before the hearing and its consideration and rejection early the next morning.</text>

<tocase>SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/78.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The Minister responded by arguing that in SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [7] - [8] Bennett J had explained why a failure to comply strictly with a 14 day notification period when a rescheduling or adjournment occurred before an appellant had actually given evidence at a hearing was the exercise of power under s 427(1)(b) of the Act. Her Honour applied a remark of the Federal Magistrate in that case that it was clear that the Tribunal had seen itself as exercising its adjournment power in rescheduling when video conferencing facilities were not available due to technical difficulties on the day and at the time appointed for the hearing.

50 I think that the present facts are different in that the re-schedulings that have occurred in the history of the appellant's notifications all happened well before any hearing had been appointed, apart from the first which was done at his request on the day before the hearing. I am fortified in this view by the fact that the language of ss 425A and 426A use the expression 'scheduled and rescheduling' rather than the word 'adjourned' as in s 427(1)(b).

51 Bennett J did not, of course, have this argument before her when deciding the case to which I have just referred. In my opinion there is some substance in the argument, but I do not propose to decide it as I think it is appropriate to decide this matter on a different ground. I have already referred to the substantial delays which this matter has had in its progress. The appellant, for whatever reason, sought an adjournment without appearing before the Tribunal on 29 April 2003. I understand the argument that that occurred because his migration agent asked for an adjournment, it was refused and the appellant was not able to attend, whether because he was not told of the adjournment having been refused, or was unable to make it to the hearing that day for other reasons.

52 Then, when the matter first came before this Court, the appellant put forward material to Stone J seeking an adjournment which gave no basis in the medical certificate on which the Court could exercise its discretion and he left it to the Court to do as it might. Thereafter, the appellant delayed a period of over 10 months before filing an application seeking leave to appeal. No explanation is before the Court for that delay.

53 Once again it appears from the material accepted by his Honour in evidence, that an application was made to Emmett J on medical grounds that an adjournment should be had of that application. Once again that was refused. Then almost 3 months later, on 4 February 2005, an application for special leave to appeal was filed in the High Court and after that was refused another 2 months delay occurred before an application was filed before the Federal Magistrates Court.

54 Although the appellant asserts that he wants to give evidence to the Tribunal and did in fact accept its invitation to do so on two occasions by the responses sent in by Mr Jivani, there is nothing in the material before me to suggest any reason for the unexplained delays and the failure of the appellant to look after his own interests, particularly after the first unfortunate experience before the Tribunal of not having someone present when the hearing was set down. To then treat this Court, on two occasions, as not requiring him to attend, even when he had, accepting that he did have, some kind of medical problems, is, in my opinion, a substantial factor to be weighed in considering whether the time of the Court should be taken up by further applications or appeals.

55 I have taken into account that this is the first occasion on which the appellant has been legally represented and competently so, but the delays that had occurred up to the time at which the matter was heard by his Honour below were such that I can see no reason why, in the exercise of the discretion to grant prerogative relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), I should do so. The period of delay was not explained before his Honour beyond what was in the appeal papers. His Honour's independent reason for refusing to grant relief, albeit on the assumption contrary to what I have found, at least on the s 424A point, that there was a jurisdictional error, seems to me to be perfectly well warranted.</text>
