<tocase>Adsteam Building Industries Pty Limited v The Queensland Cement and Lime Company Limited (No 4) [1985] 1 Qd R 127</tocase>
<text>36 The Commission submits that an allegation that action was taken by an unknown servant or agent is not liable to be struck out, nor does the fact that the pleading does not specify the person who appointed the agent. The Commission cited various authorities for these propositions. In those circumstances, the Commission submits, it cannot be said that the allegations cannot amount to the conspiracy alleged and the claim should not be struck out ( Adsteam Building Industries Pty Limited v The Queensland Cement and Lime Company Limited (No 4) [1985] 1 Qd R 127 per McPherson J at 133).

37 Mr George contends that the cases relied on by the Commission are not apposite. However, he has not established that the absence of identification is sufficient to cause that part of the pleading to be struck out.

38 From subsequent submissions, it would seem that Mr George does not complain about the lack of specificity of the pleading of agency. He does, however, contend that there are insufficient material facts in relation to the allegations of the tenth to twelfth respondents carrying on business in varying parts of Australia.

45 As was pointed out by McPherson J in Adsteam (at 133) direct evidence in a case of conspiracy is rarely available to the person alleging it. Proof generally rests on inference deduced from acts done in pursuance of the apparent common purpose. His Honour observed that this may mean that evidence of the actual making of the agreement cannot be provided but what can be given are particulars of the acts relied upon to justify the inferences sought to be drawn.

46 The Commission asserts that it has pleaded sufficient specific acts on the part of Mr George. He can respond to allegations that identify conduct in which he engaged together with the tenth to twelfth respondents. The pleading now specifies a greater degree of specificity so far as Mr George's alleged conduct is concerned. The Commission contends that Mr George should be able to respond to those allegations to the extent that they relate to his actions, whether or not all of the other participants in the activity are identified.</text>

<tocase>Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk (2005) ATPR 42-053</tocase>
<text>41 As was said by Sackville J in Seven Network v News Ltd [2003] FCA 388 at [21] material facts, not conclusions, must be pleaded with a sufficient degree of specificity, having regard to the subject matter, to convey to the opposite party the case that party has to meet. His Honour observed that it must be apparent on the face of the document that the facts pleaded if proved would establish the cause of action relied on. An example given by Sackville J at [22] was that a mere assertion that an agreement contained a provision that had the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition is not a proper pleading. It is not suggested by the Commission and it would not cure the pleading if Mr George could request further particulars ( Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk (2005) ATPR 42-053 at [20]-[25]; Shelton v National Roads &amp; Motorists Assn Ltd (2004) 51 ACSR 278 at [18]-[22]). The pleading of a conclusion without underlying material facts is liable to be struck out ( Australian Wool Innovation, Shelton ).</text>

<tocase>Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd [2002] FCA 243 ; (2002) 118 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/243.html</AustLII>
<text>44 Mr George says that it is simply not sufficient to plead that a company is "carrying on business". He relies on what was said by Merkel J in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd [2002] FCA 243 ; (2002) 118 FCR 1 at [62] to the effect that carrying on business is a question of fact that may be affected by agency, location and control by another party. There is a difference between a subsidiary carrying on its own business or whether it is carrying on the business of the parent company. At [72] his Honour observed that, where there is an integrated global enterprise, a subsidiary which is subjected to the exercise of control or influence of the parent should be viewed as carrying on business in Australia as agent of the parent. Justice Merkel emphasised the different factors that would be relevant to a determination of whether the relevant activities are those of the agent or those of the parent. While Mr George says that each of the material facts should be pleaded, it is apparent from the discussion in Bray that the whole of the evidence must be considered in order to come to a conclusion.</text>

<tocase>Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd (2006) 58 ACSR 435</tocase>
<text>42 As was observed by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at [35] [37] a cause of action can be pleaded at different levels of generality depending on the nature of the case and the subject matter and most pleadings set forth the material facts at a level which involves some element of conclusion. However, broad conclusions asserted at such a high level of generality that the opposite party cannot understand the case he or she has to meet are not sufficient.</text>

<tocase>Johnson Tiles v Esso [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1572.html</AustLII>
<text>67 The Commission says that full and extensive argument on the effect of s 6 of the Act is necessary to determine the question. That, in turn, will be affected by findings of fact made at trial. The Commission's position is that it cannot be said that the point is manifestly bad or so fatally flawed that it should not see the light of day at the trial ( Johnson Tiles v Esso [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564 at [50] )

68 As the Court said in Johnson Tiles at [50] an application to strike out which involves prolonged and serious argument should only be entertained if the Judge not only harbours doubt about the soundness of the pleading but is also satisfied that striking out will avoid the need for a trial or substantially reduce the burden of its preparation. Strike out procedures should not stultify the development of the law. The question is an important one and should be determined in the ordinary course to enable the law to be determined, if necessary on appeal, in the context where the factual issues are also determined.

69 As was observed in Johnson Tiles at [50] , it is inappropriate to decide such a question on hypothetical facts, or as a separate question, where the answer would not determine the proceedings or mean that Mr George or any other respondent would be removed as a party to the proceedings. I accept that the question has not been fully considered and answered. It is not appropriate to strike out these paragraphs as manifestly bad or fatally flawed or unarguable.

70 The nature of the case alleged against Mr George is apparent from the further amended statement of claim. Such particulars as have been and will be provided outside the pleading can be incorporated into a further amended pleading at the appropriate time. The matter is complex as is not unexpected in a case of the type as advanced by the Commission. It has already been amended following the hearing of the strike out application in response to matters raised by Mr George. Rather than engage in a further paragraph by paragraph analysis of the pleading, it may be appropriate to require the Commission to file its evidence before requiring the respondents to file their defences. I will hear from the parties as to that possible course.

71 The Commission sought to file the pleading after the hearing of the application to strike out the amended statement of claim. I will hear from the parties as to the appropriate order for costs.

 I certify that the preceding seventy one (71) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

<text>54 In answer to Mr George's assertion that the pleading of knowledge on the part of Mr George does not comply with the principles of Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661, the Commission relies on Giorgianni v R [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473 and contends that the pleading of the allegations of aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the making of the alleged agreement complies with the principles applicable to accessorial conduct in Giorgianni .</text>

<tocase>Gold Coast City Council v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1998) 157 ALR 135</tocase>
<text>43 In anticipation of a claim by the Commission that the complexity of the case and the fact that the Commission cannot identify in proper fashion the precise case it hopes to make out until after discovery, Mr George maintains that it is necessary properly to plead the case ( Gold Coast City Council v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1998) 157 ALR 135 at 154 per Drummond J). A badly pleaded case cannot, Mr George submits, be allowed to stand in the hope that the gaps and deficiencies will be remedied by subpoenas and discovery. He submits that a right to seek particulars is no answer and, in any event, the Commission has apparently provided such particulars as it can provide. He submits that if that is not the case, the Commission should provide such available particulars and, if there are none, the offending paragraphs and then the entire pleading should be struck out. The Commission has included as a particular, a reservation of a right to supplement the particulars after discovery.</text>

Mr George relied on a number of authorities that would argue against this proposition. However, in relying on this proposition, the pleading cannot be said to be unarguable so that, to the extent that it alleges liability both as the principal and as accessory, it should be struck out.</text>

<tocase>Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd [1991] FCA 557</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1991/557.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The Commission submits that a pleading of a conclusion is not necessarily objectionable; a pleading alleging agency is not objectionable ( Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd [1991] FCA 557 per French J at 7). It submits that the pleading represents a reasonable articulation of the case which is sought to be tried. A conclusion of agency will depend on the evidence to be adduced.

47 The Commission accepts that parts of the pleading state conclusions and are of a general nature. It submits that such pleading may still define the issues and inform the respondents of the case they have to meet. In the present case, the Commission says that a level of generality is appropriate and that a conclusion may also be a pleading of a material fact ( Kernel Holdings per French J; State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete [2003] FCA 1454 ; (1999) ATPR 41-961 per Drummond J). It submits that this, like Pioneer , is a case in which it is unnecessary to strike out a conclusionary pleading. It is not, the Commission submits, a question whether the facts pleaded are sufficient in themselves to give rise to a cause of action but whether it would be open on the pleadings to prove the facts at the trial which would constitute a cause of action (Pancontinental Mining Pty Ltd v Posgold Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 121 ALR 405 per Beaumont J at 414). The Commission submits that it has pleaded the overt acts of the alleged conspirators and the conclusion. The Commission says that, taken together, this leads to the conclusion that there was an arrangement or understanding which contained a provision of the type impugned.</text>

<tocase>Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 3 All ER 918</tocase>
<text>34 Broadly, the Commission alleges that AAA Club meetings occurred for the purpose of coordinating prices in various markets, including but not limited to Australia. At some meetings the attenders have been identified. Some of the meetings were attended by the fourteenth respondent who was a servant or agent of APP Australia. APP Australia then implemented the agreed prices. Accepting that the Commission cannot identify all of the members of the group and that the pleading alleges directions by unidentified members, the Commission relies upon Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 3 All ER 918. The Commission says that Meridian stands for the proposition that the process of determining whether a particular individual's act or knowledge is attributable to a corporation is complex and is based on all of the evidence. The Commission emphasises that this is established by the evidence, not the pleading.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1966/11.html</AustLII>
<text>66 The Commission contends that there is authority to support the proposition that s 6(2) does extend the application of the principal provisions of the Act to corporations while they are engaged in overseas trade and commerce ( CLM Holdings at 244; Seamen's Union of Australia v Utah Development Co [1978] HCA 46 ; (1978) 144 CLR 120 at 136 137; Meyer Heine Pty Ltd v China Navigation Co Ltd [1966] HCA 11 ; (1966) 115 CLR 10 per Menzies J at 38). It submits that, with the changing times and more experience with cartels, the High Court may adopt an "effects test" to competition law jurisdiction. The Commission's submission is that this is a novel question in an area of law that is still developing. It accepts that cases and texts relied upon by Mr George, such as Zhu contain dicta and comment in support of his position but submits that there is no binding authority on the point. The Commission concedes that the dicta in Zhu is contrary to its case on the application of s 6 of the Act. However, it points out that the point has not been fully argued and that there is authority, including what it describes as a powerful dissenting opinion in the High Court to supports its contention.</text>

<text>24 The Commission submits that it is arguable that, as in a case of criminal conspiracy, a person may be liable under s 45 of the Act for conspiring with persons unknown. Similarly, it is arguable that a person may be liable for having an understanding restricted to the conduct to be pursued by one of the parties without any element of mutual obligation so far as the other party or parties to the understanding are concerned ( Morphett Arms Hotel Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1980) 30 ALR 88; Trade Practices Commission v Email Limited (1980) 43 FCR 383).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/6.html</AustLII>
<text>65 Under the heading "contraventions", the pleading bears a sub-heading "nexus with Australia". The parties accept that the effect of paragraphs 177 and 179 in this part of the pleading is to bring conduct occurring outside Australia within the reach of the Act by the operation of s 6(2)(b) of the Act. Mr George contends that s 6(2)(b) does not give the Act extra-territorial operation. He relies upon authority such as R v Australian Industrial Court; ex parte CLM Holdings Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 6 ; (1977) 136 CLR 235 at 234 235 and Zhu v The Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at [96] in support of that proposition. He submits that s 6(2)(b) provides wider constitutional support for the Act but does not operate to bring conduct carried on outside Australia within the ambit of the Act.

66 The Commission contends that there is authority to support the proposition that s 6(2) does extend the application of the principal provisions of the Act to corporations while they are engaged in overseas trade and commerce ( CLM Holdings at 244; Seamen's Union of Australia v Utah Development Co [1978] HCA 46 ; (1978) 144 CLR 120 at 136 137; Meyer Heine Pty Ltd v China Navigation Co Ltd [1966] HCA 11 ; (1966) 115 CLR 10 per Menzies J at 38).

<tocase>Stanley v Layne Christenson &amp; Co [2006] WASCA 56</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASCA/2006/56.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Central to the Commission's submissions is the principle that in a modern form of pleading some generality and the pleading of conclusions are allowable. Further, the Commission submits that in claims of conspiracy sought to be proved by inference from acts done in pursuance of the apparent common purpose, it may be appropriate to defer the provision of particulars until after appropriate discovery or not require them where they are within the knowledge of the respondent ( Stanley v Layne Christenson &amp; Co [2006] WASCA 56 per Wheeler J [50]). It may also be appropriate simply to require the Commission to put on its evidence.

49 It is relevant that this is a complex case, alleging cartel behaviour. This necessarily involves pleading conduct the effect of which is known and some of the alleged participants identified, but where information cannot be provided until after discovery and subpoenas. I do not consider that the Commission has impermissibly pleaded conclusions, although some conclusions are present in the pleading. The pleading sets out, with sufficient clarity, the case against Mr George.

50 Mr George's complaint seems to be that, by pleading what he describes as material facts, being the details of known incidences of meetings of the AAA Club as particulars, the Commission can add other meetings. The same applies to other specific paragraphs referred to by Mr George. The concern expressed was not really as to the form of the pleading, which may not be susceptible to a strike out, but as to the lack of real detail. He fears that the Commission will attempt to fill the gaps in the case by the process of rolling discovery and subpoenas. Mr George is not alleged to have been present at any of the AAA Club meetings. He is not alleged to have been present when the alleged arrangements were made and understandings arrived at. His alleged knowledge and actions in contemplation of the arrangement or understanding must, therefore, be based on inferences. Mr George complains that there are no material facts pleaded from which those inferences are invited to be drawn. He wants those facts, matters and circumstances to be included formally in the pleading and not provided as particulars, as offered by the Commission.</text>

Similarly, it is arguable that a person may be liable for having an understanding restricted to the conduct to be pursued by one of the parties without any element of mutual obligation so far as the other party or parties to the understanding are concerned ( Morphett Arms Hotel Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1980) 30 ALR 88; Trade Practices Commission v Email Limited (1980) 43 FCR 383). The Commission also says that a meeting of minds does not require the identity of the other party or parties to be known, as long as there is sufficient material from which it can be inferred that Mr George had a meeting of minds with another person.</text>

<text>54 In answer to Mr George's assertion that the pleading of knowledge on the part of Mr George does not comply with the principles of Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661, the Commission relies on Giorgianni v R [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473 and contends that the pleading of the allegations of aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the making of the alleged agreement complies with the principles applicable to accessorial conduct in Giorgianni .</text>

<tocase>Zhu v The Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/56.html</AustLII>
<text>65 Under the heading "contraventions", the pleading bears a sub-heading "nexus with Australia". The parties accept that the effect of paragraphs 177 and 179 in this part of the pleading is to bring conduct occurring outside Australia within the reach of the Act by the operation of s 6(2)(b) of the Act. Mr George contends that s 6(2)(b) does not give the Act extra-territorial operation. He relies upon authority such as R v Australian Industrial Court; ex parte CLM Holdings Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 6 ; (1977) 136 CLR 235 at 234 235 and Zhu v The Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at [96] in support of that proposition. He submits that s 6(2)(b) provides wider constitutional support for the Act but does not operate to bring conduct carried on outside Australia within the ambit of the Act.

66 The Commission contends that there is authority to support the proposition that s 6(2) does extend the application of the principal provisions of the Act to corporations while they are engaged in overseas trade and commerce ( CLM Holdings at 244; Seamen's Union of Australia v Utah Development Co [1978] HCA 46 ; (1978) 144 CLR 120 at 136 137; Meyer Heine Pty Ltd v China Navigation Co Ltd [1966] HCA 11 ; (1966) 115 CLR 10 per Menzies J at 38). It submits that, with the changing times and more experience with cartels, the High Court may adopt an "effects test" to competition law jurisdiction. The Commission's submission is that this is a novel question in an area of law that is still developing. It accepts that cases and texts relied upon by Mr George, such as Zhu contain dicta and comment in support of his position but submits that there is no binding authority on the point. The Commission concedes that the dicta in Zhu is contrary to its case on the application of s 6 of the Act. However, it points out that the point has not been fully argued and that there is authority, including what it describes as a powerful dissenting opinion in the High Court to supports its contention.</text>
