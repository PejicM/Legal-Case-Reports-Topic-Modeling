<text>4 The applicant relies on O 13 r 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') which permits the amendment of ' any document in the proceeding '. That applies to a native title determination application, subject to the constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B of the [2003] FCA 1423 ; Act ( Anderson v Western Australia (2003) 134 FCR 1 at [36] per French J; Strickland v Western Australia [1999] FCA 221 ; (1999) 89 FCR 117 at [9] per Nicholson J). The constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B are not relevant to the first motion.</text>

<tocase>Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/760.html</AustLII>
<text>23 Section 251B of the Act reflects the communal character of native title. The authorisation process must be able to be traced to a decision of the native title claim group who adopt that process ( Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760 per French J at [44]). A meeting which purports to authorise the replacement of applicants should be attended by persons ' fairly representative of the native title claim [group] concerned ' ( Bolton at [46]). There is no suggestion that this was not the case. The evidence of Jodi Neale, the anthropologist who attended the meeting and on whose research the replacement claim group description is based, is that those in attendance were reasonably representative of the replacement claim group.

24 In summary, the resolutions were made by a group of Njamal people. Those persons were sufficiently representative of the replacement claim group and made the resolutions in accordance with an agreed process. It follows that the decision-making processes required by s 66B have been proved ( Bolton at [42]).

25 By s 64(5) of the Act, if a claimant application is amended to replace the applicant with a new applicant, the amended application must be accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the new applicant attesting to the matters specified in subss 64(5)(a) and (b). Each of the replacement applicants has sworn and filed an affidavit and I am satisfied that s 64(5) has been complied with.

26 The only person opposing this application to replace the applicant is Mr McPhee. He complains that the meeting was ' flawed ' because the members in attendance were not properly informed of matters relevant to their decision. Mr McPhee submits that the Court should not, as a matter of discretion, make orders to replace the applicant. Mr McPhee did not attend the meeting.

39 The withdrawal and conferring of authority for the purposes of a s 66B application must be shown to flow from the claim group ( Bolton at [44]). Once this is established, the actions of the claim group and the means by which it makes decisions is a matter for it. It is not for the Court to interfere with decisions reached in accordance with the Act. It is not for the Court to consider the wisdom of those decisions or whether, in this case, there is merit in Mr McPhee's concerns. It is for him to communicate those concerns, if he wishes to do so, to the other claimants and for the applicant, on receipt of instructions from the claim group, to act as authorised. Upon the making of the orders sought by the first motion, the terms of s 66B of the Act will be satisfied. The Court has a discretion as to whether it should exercise its power under s 66B (subs 66B(2) of the Act; Daniel at [18]). That discretion should be exercised to make the orders sought by the replacement applicant.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/597.html</AustLII>
<text>14 Section 66B of the Act provides for a procedure for the replacement of the applicant ( Chapman on behalf of the Wakka Wakka People # 2 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 597 per Kiefel J at [2]). Under subs 66B(1)(a)(i), members of a claim group who seek to replace an existing applicant must relevantly establish ( Daniel v The State of Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 per French J at [17]) that:
 
(1) There is a claimant application.
 
(2) Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the claim group.
 
 (3) The persons to be replaced are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.
 (4) The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</text>

<tocase>Daniel v The State of Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278</tocase>
<text>14 Section 66B of the Act provides for a procedure for the replacement of the applicant ( Chapman on behalf of the Wakka Wakka People # 2 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 597 per Kiefel J at [2]). Under subs 66B(1)(a)(i), members of a claim group who seek to replace an existing applicant must relevantly establish ( Daniel v The State of Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 per French J at [17]) that:
 
(1) There is a claimant application.
 
(2) Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the claim group.
 
 (3) The persons to be replaced are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.
 (4) The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.

16 As to the remaining criteria, s 251B of the Act governs when a person (or persons) is authorised by all of the persons in the claim group and applies in determining when a person is authorised for the purposes of s 66B ( Daniel at [14]). Authorisation may be in accordance with a process of decision-making according to traditional laws and customs (s 251B(a) of the Act). Where there is no such process, it may be in accordance with a process agreed and adopted by the claim group (s 251B(b) of the Act).

17 Whether there is authorisation for the purposes of s 66B in any given case is a question of fact. In the present case, the evidence is that there is no precise process or cultural precedent under the traditional laws and customs of the Njamal people that must be followed for decisions of the kind contemplated by s 66B of the Act or otherwise for authorising claim group members to represent the group as applicant. Decisions as to the authorisation or removal of applicants are not part of Njamal traditional law and culture. Instead, the Njamal people have agreed to and adopted a process of making decisions (s 251B(b) of the Act). Pursuant to that process, decisions are made by resolution or consensus at community meetings organised by the Pilbara Native Title Services ('PNTS'). All known Njamal people are included on a mailing list and invited by letter to attend such meetings. The mailing list has been compiled with the input of anthropologists who have been involved in researching the claims and genealogies. Notices are also sent to communities where Njamal people reside. Meetings have been called and held where families are represented and individuals or families with particular interest or authority in relation to the decisions being contemplated are present. Decisions at those meetings have been made by consensus and by way of formal resolutions.

18 Although it is not possible for every member of the claim group to attend each community meeting, the group regards itself as bound by the decisions of those who are present. Major decisions have been made over a number of years in this manner. At such meetings of the larger Njamal community decisions have been made to form a working group to deal with day to day claim group business and to participate in surveys in Njamal country. The Njamal people chosen at these meetings are not all members of the current claim group.

19 Community meetings have become the accepted way of making major decisions on matters such as the claim areas, authorisation of the applicant and major future act decisions. Where there is not a reasonably representative group of people at a community meeting or insufficient attendees, the persons present may decide that it is inappropriate for a decision to be made at that meeting. The resolutions at the meeting were in accordance with the decision-making process previously used and, I am informed, also used to authorise the current applicant.

20 The sole agenda items at the meeting were ' claim group description ' and ' replacement of the applicants '. Following discussion of each item, the members present resolved:
 
 &#8226; to amend the claim group description (the first resolution);
 &#8226; no longer to authorise the current applicant ' as a group ' to make the application in these proceedings or to deal with matters in relation to it;
 &#8226; to remove 11 of the 17 persons who currently comprise the applicant and to include three new persons as applicant (the second resolution);
 &#8226; to authorise the replacement applicant to be the applicant in these proceedings and to deal with matters related to the application in accordance with decisions of the Njamal native title claim group through community meetings; 
 &#8226; to authorise the replacement applicant to bring an application in this Court to replace the current applicant and to authorise them to instruct PNTS to act for them, or to organise or appoint legal representatives to act for them, in relation to that application.

39 The withdrawal and conferring of authority for the purposes of a s 66B application must be shown to flow from the claim group ( Bolton at [44]). Once this is established, the actions of the claim group and the means by which it makes decisions is a matter for it. It is not for the Court to interfere with decisions reached in accordance with the Act. It is not for the Court to consider the wisdom of those decisions or whether, in this case, there is merit in Mr McPhee's concerns. It is for him to communicate those concerns, if he wishes to do so, to the other claimants and for the applicant, on receipt of instructions from the claim group, to act as authorised. Upon the making of the orders sought by the first motion, the terms of s 66B of the Act will be satisfied. The Court has a discretion as to whether it should exercise its power under s 66B (subs 66B(2) of the Act; Daniel at [18]). That discretion should be exercised to make the orders sought by the replacement applicant.</text>

<tocase>Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/132.html</AustLII>
<text>40 Section 62A of the Act relevantly provides that the applicant in a claimant application may deal with all matters arising under the Act in relation to the application. That includes the amendment of the application from time to time ( Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169 at [12] per French J).

41 The procedural chronology is as follows:
 
 &#8226; The description of the replacement claim group is agreed (25 October 2006).
 &#8226; The replacement claim group resolves that the current applicant ' as a group ' is no longer authorised to deal with the application (25 October 2006). 
 &#8226; The replacement applicant is authorised by the replacement claim group (25 October 2006). 
 &#8226; The first motion is filed (27 February 2007). It lists the replacement applicant as the party moving the Court for orders. 
 &#8226; The first motion is amended to specify the current applicant as the moving party (28 February 2007). 
 &#8226; The Court is moved for orders by the current applicant pursuant to the first motion as amended (21 March 2007 and 28 May 2007).

42 A question arises as to whether the current applicant can move the Court for orders to amend the application in these circumstances. On one view, until the making of orders to replace the current applicant, it remains the applicant in the proceedings and may deal with the application and bring the first motion. On the other hand, however, the unchallenged evidence is that the replacement claim group withdrew the current applicant's authority to deal with the application at the meeting. That would, on its face, include a revocation of the authority to file and prosecute a notice of motion to amend the application.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1517.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The adoption of a process of decision-making does not require all members of the claim group to be involved in making the decision. Nor does it require a unanimous vote ( Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 per Stone J at [25]). The members of the claim group should be given every reasonable opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. It cannot, logically, be the case that all, in the sense of each and every member of the claim group must be involved in and agree to the proposed decision. That would, as has been pointed out in Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378 at [33] per O'Loughlin J include persons who are unable to participate by reason of age, mental capacity or unknown whereabouts and would permit an individual to prevent the progress of a claim. To cancel a meeting merely because one member is unable to attend would also constitute a waste of limited resources. The costs of holding a Njamal community meeting can exceed $13,000.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/135.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The proposed technical amendments, broadly and in summary:
 
 &#8226; correct typographical errors; 
 &#8226; exclude category B past and intermediate period acts wholly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of any native title rights or interests;
 &#8226; exclude a claim of native title rights and interests conferring exclusive rights over areas in relation to which a previous non-exclusive possession act has been done; 
 &#8226; distinguish between rights and interests claimed over areas where a claim of exclusive possession can be recognised and areas where such a claim cannot be recognised, in accordance with s 190B(9)(c) of the Act; 
 &#8226; delete certain rights and interests claimed, to reflect decisions of the High Court ( Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1) and the Full Federal Court ( Northern Territory v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135) ; and
 &#8226; better address the requirements of the Act (ss 62(2)(e) and 190B(5)) in describing the native title rights and interests claimed.

11 The technical amendments do not affect the substantive rights and interests claimed and they are supported by the first respondent, the State of Western Australia. There is no evidence that the technical amendments were approved by the replacement claim group. Subject to the procedural matters that I will later outline, however, it is appropriate that the application be so amended.

12 In the second motion, the replacement applicant applies for orders that it replace the current applicant. The replacement involves the removal of 11 persons and the addition of three new persons. Of the 11 persons proposed to be removed, three are deceased and seven consent to being removed. The other is Mr McPhee. There is no opposition to the removal of the deceased applicant members or to the addition of the proposed new members. Six members of the current applicant will remain members of the replacement applicant.</text>
