<tocase>Nelson v Comcare [2008] AATA 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2008/214.html</AustLII>
<text>On 19 March 2008, the Tribunal affirmed the two decisions made by the respondent dated 27 September 2006 and 2 May 2007 ( Nelson v Comcare [2008] AATA 214).

The applicant appeals to this Court from that decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). An appeal under that section must be on a question of law.

The applicant's Notice of Appeal raises four questions of law and advances several grounds in support of his contentions in respect of those questions of law.

Despite the length of the Notice of Appeal, the applicant's appeal raises only one issue, namely, whether the Tribunal failed to address and make a determination concerning the applicant's contention that his underlying psychiatric condition was " aggravated " within the meaning of the definition of " disease " in s 4(1) of the Act by his employment with Centrelink. The applicant accepted that the above formulation of the matters which the applicant seeks to raise on appeal from the Tribunal captures the essence of the applicant's case on appeal.

Section 14 of the Act provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work or impairment.</text>

<tocase>Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 245 ALR 561</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/236.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition had been aggravated by his employment in the sense contemplated by the definitions in s 4 of the Act. The argument was not developed much but this does not detract from the fact that the argument was put. The Tribunal was obliged to turn its mind to the argument and to deal with the question of aggravation. It was a significant part of the applicant's case before the Tribunal. The argument was seriously advanced by the applicant and was worthy of serious consideration. Whilst it is true that the Tribunal is not required to consider and address every submission made to it, serious submissions of the type to which I have just alluded must be addressed ( Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276 277 per Jenkinson J). It is an error of law for the Tribunal not to consider such a submission and not to reveal its consideration of that submission in its Reasons for Decision (see Hartnett v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2004] FCA 50 at [50] ; and Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 245 ALR 561 at [88] [89] (pp 579 480)). This statement of principle is consistent with the more general statements of principle directed to giving content to the concept of error of law made by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 at [59] (pp 597 598).</text>

<text>It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that an ailment will be aggravated within the meaning of those expressions in the definitions contained in s 4 of the Act if it becomes more severe or is hastened in some way. The terms aggravation and acceleration in the present context have been given their normal English meanings in judgments of this Court (see Casarotto v Australian Postal Commission [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 404 405 and Martin v Australian Postal Corporation [1999] FCA 655 at [22] [28]).</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/15.html</AustLII>
<text>The Tribunal then returned to the concept of " material contribution ". At this point in its reasons, it referred to and discussed the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536.

The Tribunal then concluded its Reasons with the following (at [60]): 
 
 After considering all the evidence, in particular the possible factors that may have contributed to the onset or aggravation of the Applicant's psychiatric condition, we find that the circumstances of the Applicant's employment with Centrelink did not substantially contribute to his disease. Mr Nelson is not entitled to compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Act. It follows that he is not entitled to compensation in respect of medical expenses under section 16, nor is he entitled to compensation for incapacity under sections 19 , 20 , 21 or 21A of the Act.

The only places that the concept of " aggravation of an ailment " were mentioned at all in the Tribunal's Reasons was at [5] (when s 4 of the Act was extracted) and at [60].

In the present case, in order to make good the contention concerning aggravation of an existing ailment which the applicant submits was advanced to the Tribunal, the applicant would need to demonstrate that, at the time he commenced his employment with Centrelink, he was suffering an ailment within the relevant definition and that that ailment was aggravated (ie made more severe) by his employment by Centrelink or that the aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by his employment by Centrelink. The notion of material contribution was explained by Finn J in Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536. In that case, his Honour concluded that, in order to assess whether the aggravation of an ailment was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment, the Court was obliged to evaluate all relevant contributing factors in order to determine whether the employment made a contribution which was more than a mere contributing factor. His Honour described the exercise as a matter of fact and degree ( Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536 at [16] (p 542 543)).

The fundamental premise of the applicant's argument is that the Tribunal simply failed to address his case based upon alleged aggravation of an existing ailment (viz his underlying psychiatric condition).

The Tribunal described the applicant's complaint at [1] of its Reasons as a complaint to the effect that his psychological condition was sustained because of his employment. That language tends to suggest that the Tribunal regarded the applicant's case as being confined to a case based upon the contention that he sustained an ailment as an employee of Centrelink, being an ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by Centrelink. The terms of the general formulation of the issue in [1] of the Tribunal's Reasons tend to suggest that the Tribunal did not regard aggravation of an existing ailment as being an alternative basis for the applicant's claims before it.</text>
