<tocase>WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 624</tocase>
<text>16 The notice of appeal raises two grounds not in issue before the Federal Magistrate. In WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 624, new appeal grounds were substituted at the last minute when the appellant had been assigned pro bono counsel. French J noted at [18]:
 
 It is ordinarily regarded as exceptional to allow a point to be raised on appeal that was not raised at first instance University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68; 59 ALJR 481; Crampton v R [2000] HCA 60 ; (2000) 206 CLR 161; 176 ALR 369. But as Branson and Katz JJ said in H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 63 ALD 43 at [3]:
 
 
 "This does not mean that an issue can never be argued on appeal that was not argued at the hearing at first instance."

17 His Honour continued at [19]:
 
 To allow too readily the running of new points, or indeed a whole new case, on appeal is to undermine the appellate process by rendering the trial process almost irrelevant.

18 There appear to be no "exceptional" circumstances in this case. The appellant sought to impugn the Tribunal's decision under s 425(1) of the Act before the Federal Magistrate. That point has now been abandoned in favour of two quite different grounds. To allow the appellant to agitate those grounds would be to render the process before the Federal Magistrate irrelevant and indeed contrary to the policy in the Act, as this Court would be made the Court of first instance. The appellant, who was unrepresented on appeal, could not explain why the present course had been adopted and why the matters sought to be agitated could not have been raised before the Federal Magistrate. For those reasons, in my opinion, it would have been inappropriate to have allowed the appellant to argue those matters on this appeal. However, there is a more compelling reason for reaching that conclusion. Both new grounds would fail for the simple reason that the Tribunal did not rely on any country information. The grounds of appeal are therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal's decision.

19 The appeal must be dismissed and the appellant must pay the first respondent's costs.

 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander J.
