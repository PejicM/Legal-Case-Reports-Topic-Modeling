<tocase>Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1458.html</AustLII>
<text>It is true that the authorities, including three recent cases that have considered the question in relation to international air freight services, accept the proposition (either expressly or impliedly) that a global market is capable of constituting a market in Australia: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] , Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166 at [21] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd (2009) 253 ALR 89 at [35]; Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 at [70] .

In Auskay , Tracey J dealt with an application to strike out a pleading in a class action that alleged contraventions of ss 45 and 45A of the Act in relation to understandings between Qantas and other international airlines in terms that resemble the nature of the allegations in the present case.

Referring to the geographic location of the market, Tracey J said at [21]: 
The respondents in the present proceeding are entitled to know where in Australia it is said that they compete with each other named respondent for the provision of international airfreight services. This will depend on where negotiations between the respondents and their customers take place and contracts are entered into.

The deficiency which Tracey J identified in the pleading was that it failed to identify any market whatsoever. That is sufficient to distinguish Auskay from the present proceeding.

That proposition is somewhat at odds with the remarks of Middleton J in Emirates at [66] that the place of contracting is not determinative of the geographic location of the market. Nevertheless, his Honour did leave open at [72] the possibility that the place of contracting will have some relevance to the determination of the place where the competition takes place. His Honour went on to say of the observations of Tracey J in Auskay : 
I do not read his Honour's comments (made in the context of a pleading dispute) as dictating that in determinating [sic] the geographic location of the market one is confined by the location of the making of the contract for the subject services.

However, I do not need to consider whether Middleton J's explanation of the earlier remarks of Tracey J in Auskay is correct. That is because, on the view I have reached, the pleading is defective for reasons which do not depend upon the relationship between the place of contracting and the geographic location of the market.

<text>In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v British Airways PLC [2008] FCA 1977 at [20] , Lindgren J adopted the remarks he had earlier expressed in ACCC v Qantas. However, this observation is also to be read in light of admissions made by British Airways in that case. It does not, in my view, amount to a statement of general principle which is sufficient to support the present pleading.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd (2009) 253 ALR 89</tocase>
<text>It is true that the authorities, including three recent cases that have considered the question in relation to international air freight services, accept the proposition (either expressly or impliedly) that a global market is capable of constituting a market in Australia: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] , Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166 at [21] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd (2009) 253 ALR 89 at [35]; Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 at [70] .

In my opinion, neither Auskay, Emirates nor ACCC v Qantas , to which I have referred above, answer the question of whether the pleading is deficient in the respects that I have stated.

In ACCC v Qantas , Lindgren J imposed penalties and other relief on Qantas for contravention of s 45 of the Act in relation to understandings of the type alleged in the present proceeding.

However, in reading his Honour's remarks, it is necessary to bear in mind that, for the purpose of the proceeding, Qantas admitted that its conduct contravened s 45 of the Act.

His Honour determined the appropriate penalty in light of a statement of agreed facts which included an admission by Qantas that there is a worldwide market for air cargo services and that its conduct may also be considered by reference to a number of narrower markets, including a market or markets in Australia.

Lindgren J referred at [31] to the relevant territorial connection provisions stated in ss 4E and 5 of the Act. He was satisfied that s 5 extended the provisions of s 45 of the Act to the relevant conduct because Qantas is incorporated in Australia. Similarly, s 5 would apply in the present case (subject to the elimination of the identified defects) because Singapore Airlines carried on business here.

The two critical paragraphs of the judgment of Lindgren J are [35] and [38] which I will set out below: The definition of "market in Australia" in s 4E excludes, however, a market that is wholly outside Australia. Part of the present global and international air cargo market necessarily falls within the territorial boundaries of Australia. The fuel surcharge understanding necessarily affected the prices exacted from persons, including persons in Australia, in respect of the international transport of cargo by air. 
...
 Since the fuel surcharge understanding had the purpose and effect of substantially lessening competition in the worldwide market for air cargo services (including by virtue of the operation of s 45A), giving effect to it anywhere in the world contravened s 45(2)(b) of the Act.

Mr O'Bryan relied on those paragraphs of Lindgren J's judgment to support the pleading. However, I do not think they assist. This is because they are to be read in light of the admissions to which I referred above.

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v British Airways PLC [2008] FCA 1977 at [20] , Lindgren J adopted the remarks he had earlier expressed in ACCC v Qantas. However, this observation is also to be read in light of admissions made by British Airways in that case. It does not, in my view, amount to a statement of general principle which is sufficient to support the present pleading.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/11.html</AustLII>
<text>It is true, as was observed by Dawson J in Banque Commerciale SA en liquidation v Akhil Holdings Limited [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 293, that pleadings are but a means to an end, not an end in themselves. But the function of pleadings is an important one because it is the pleading which defines the issues and presents the claim with reasonable clarity.

For the reasons mentioned above, the Statement of Claim does not fulfil that function. It leaves open the fundamental nature of the ACCC's case that the conduct in question substantially lessens competition in a market in Australia. Subject to one exception, there are simply no material facts stated which demonstrate that the price fixing understandings in respect of international air freight services between destinations outside Australia have the proscribed effect on competition in a market in Australia.

As Mr Archibald submitted, the key vice in the pleading is that the entirety of the conduct that occurs in respect of the making and giving effect to each of the understandings is said to involve a contravention. It is the breadth and generality of that allegation, without material facts to support it, which constitutes the real defect.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/312.html</AustLII>
<text>It is true that the authorities, including three recent cases that have considered the question in relation to international air freight services, accept the proposition (either expressly or impliedly) that a global market is capable of constituting a market in Australia: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] , Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166 at [21] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd (2009) 253 ALR 89 at [35]; Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 at [70] .

Also, in Emirates , Middleton J accepted that inbound and outbound air freight services are capable of being part of the Australian market: Emirates at [62], [63].

It follows in my view that Singapore Airlines cannot succeed on its first objection to the Statement of Claim because the pleaded markets are at least capable of amounting to markets in Australia.

But it does not follow that this provides an answer to the second ground of attack on the pleading. That is because the Statement of Claim alleges a very large number of price fixing understandings, many of which concern freight services between routes which, on their face, have no connection with Australia. This is illustrated in the pleading of the May 2003 Indonesia Understanding and the UAE 2004 Level 5 surcharge understanding which I have set out at [38] and [39] above.

Also, for s 45A(1) to be engaged, the services that are the subject of the anti-competitive provision must be supplied by the party to the illegal understanding in competition with the other party in a market in Australia: see Emirates at [22], citing Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty Limited (1991) 30 FCR 385 at 419 420; South Sydney District Rugby League Ltd v News Ltd [2000] FCA 1541 ; (2000) 177 ALR 611 at [195] and ss 45A(8), 4D(1)(a) and 4D(2) of the Act.

The observations made by Tracey J at [21] as to the relationship between the geographic market and the place of contracting were somewhat diluted by the remarks of Middleton J in Emirates at [72]. I will refer to that issue below but it does not affect the pleading deficiencies which I have identified in the ACCC's Statement of Claim.

In Emirates , the applicants, who were Emirates and Singapore Airlines, sought to challenge, inter alia , the validity of notices issued to them under s 155 of the Act. The notices sought documents and information in relation to alleged price fixing arrangements relating to international air cargo services. That phrase included international flights inbound to, and outbound from, Australia.

The essential question was whether the notices were invalid on the ground alleged by Emirates and Singapore Airlines, namely that they did not relate to a market in Australia. That ground failed because the applicants were unable to eliminate any reasonable hypothesis which was inconsistent with the contention that the market was wholly outside Australia.

Middleton J was of the view that on the evidence adduced before him, the market for air cargo services into Australia may be part of the international cargo market and the Australian market is, or may be, a part of that international market.

It is true that this observation and his Honour's other observations at [60] [73] support the proposition that the markets pleaded in the present case are capable of amounting to markets in Australia. But these observations do not answer the question which arises in the present application, namely whether the pleading states the material facts that support the allegation that the totality of the impugned conduct substantially lessens competition in a market in Australia.

Mr O'Bryan submitted that the decision in Emirates gives rise to an issue estoppel. In my view it does not because, for the reasons stated above, Emirates did not decide the same question as that which arises in the present case: Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at [21] , [40]. The relevance of the place of contracting

That proposition is somewhat at odds with the remarks of Middleton J in Emirates at [66] that the place of contracting is not determinative of the geographic location of the market. Nevertheless, his Honour did leave open at [72] the possibility that the place of contracting will have some relevance to the determination of the place where the competition takes place. His Honour went on to say of the observations of Tracey J in Auskay : 
I do not read his Honour's comments (made in the context of a pleading dispute) as dictating that in determinating [sic] the geographic location of the market one is confined by the location of the making of the contract for the subject services.

Nevertheless, I do not consider the defect to be incurable. The recent decisions to which I have referred show that it may well be possible for the ACCC to cure the defects. This is particularly so in the light of the remarks of Middleton J in Emirates because his Honour specifically endorsed the proposition that price fixing between two international points in relation to the supply of international air cargo services, wherever engaged in, may have the proscribed effect on competition in a market in Australia.

I therefore propose to grant leave to the ACCC to replead within a period to be agreed between the parties. The Exception

Mr Archibald conceded that the seventh type of understanding referred to at [35] above, namely the Australian-Middle East understanding, does not suffer from the defects to which I have referred.</text>

<text>In my view, his Honour's observations do not stand for the proposition that it is sufficient to plead a global market, and the giving of effect to it anywhere in the world, in order to give rise to an arguable claim of contravention of s 45(2) of the Act. That was not the issue before his Honour, and the apparent breadth of his Honour's remarks at [38] seem to me to be explicable by the admissions made by Qantas: Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] .</text>
