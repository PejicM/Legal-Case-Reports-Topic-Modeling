<tocase>Kolotex Glo Australia Pty Ltd v Sara Lee Personal Products (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 1</tocase>
<text>12 The next use of the words GO WACKO relied upon as use as a trade mark, is in the expression DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS which appears on the front of Effem's packaging. It is possible for a word or words forming only part of a composite expression to be used as a trade mark. Examples are found in Kolotex Glo Australia Pty Ltd v Sara Lee Personal Products (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 1 (" Kolotex ") and Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 242. There are also cases in which a word (which is a registered trade mark) appears in an expression used by an alleged infringer where it has been held that such use does not constitute infringement. Pepsico was such a case. Before discussing the two authorities where words within an expression were used as trade marks, it is desirable to refer to the judgment of the High Court in Mark Foy's Ltd v Davies Coop and Company Ltd [1956] HCA 41 ; (1956) 95 CLR 190.

16 In Kolotex, the applicant was the owner of the registered trade mark SHEER RELIEF, although the registration was subject to a disclaimer of any right to the separate exclusive use to the words "sheer" and "relief". For over 20 years, the applicant had successfully marketed lines of pantyhose and stockings styled "Sheer Relief". Wilcox J considered whether the words "Sheer Relief", which were used by the respondent in the phrases "Sheer Relief for Active Legs" and "Sheer Relief For Active Legs That Doesn't Show" on the packaging of its products, were used as a trade mark. His Honour found that the respondent had decided to market a line of pantyhose and stockings to directly compete with the "Sheer Relief" line. In an infringement action, the respondent raised the defences that the use of the expression "Sheer Relief" was descriptive of the character or quality of the product and also was not use as a trade mark.

17 Wilcox J rejected both defences. The respondent's contention that "Sheer Relief" was not used as a trade mark was rejected partly on the basis of the significance of those words in the expression which appeared on the packaging. Early in his reasons, he accepted a submission of the applicant (not disputed by the respondent) that the registered mark was a pun or clever play on words. The word "sheer" described the physical nature of the fabric, yet also related to the extent of relief offered. It was absolute or unqualified. The word "relief" conveyed a freedom from tiredness or fatigue. Each word of the combination could have worked separately but also as a qualification for the other word which enhanced the meaning of both. The combination did not have an exclusive meaning but displayed an attractive plurality of meanings.

18 Later in his reasons, Wilcox J noted that the expression "Sheer Relief for Active Legs" was used on the respondent's packaging for pantyhose three times and in such a manner as to indicate that the words "Sheer Relief" were connected in some way with the applicant's goods. Wilcox J noted that the expression "Sheer Relief for Active Legs" was used twice on the packaging as a subheading appearing immediately following product titles used by the respondent. Wilcox J then said (at [25] and [26]):
 
 ... The phrase "Sheer Relief for Active Legs" acts as a third title or caption. It does so by using two catchy and memorable words, which contain a clever double meaning and are already well-known in the trade. Having regard to the evidence that the respondent set out to copy the applicant's product exactly, there can be little doubt that its intention was to appropriate, if it could, the reputation attaching to that subtitle. It appears to have achieved some success in that endeavour. There is evidence of two incidents, in different stores, where customers picked the respondent's product from the display shelves in the belief that it was that of the applicant. 
 
 The use of the additional words "for active legs" is important in considering whether the words "Sheer Relief" are used by the respondent for product identification; but, once it is concluded that they are so used, the existence of the other words cannot derogate from the conclusion that there is an infringement.

<tocase>Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (t/as Frito-Lay Australia) v Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd (1996) 135 ALR 192</tocase>
<text>7 The starting point in determining whether the words GO WACKO are a trade mark is the definition of "trade mark" in s 17 of the Act. That section defines "trade mark" as a sign used to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from the goods or services of another. Whether a "sign" (which is defined broadly in s 6) is used in this way is to be assessed objectively, having regard to the context in which the sign is used. Many of the relevant authorities were discussed by Sackville J in Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (t/as Frito-Lay Australia) v Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd (1996) 135 ALR 192 (" Pepsico ") at 209-214.

8 WACKO is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary (third edition) as a noun: "a person who is insane in some way; an eccentric", and as an adjective: "crazy; weird; eccentric". An alternative spelling is also given, namely WHACKO. The latter spelling has an additional meaning as an interjection constituting "an expression denoting pleasure, delight etc". Potentially, therefore, the word (spelt WACKO or WHACKO) has a double meaning.

9 I am not satisfied that use of the words GO WACKO on the back of the packaging amounts to use as a trade mark. In the images of the packaging in evidence (which appear to be colour photocopies) the packaging is predominantly red. The words GO WACKO are white and the background colour of the voice balloon is blue. The text containing the instructions appears to be black, against a bright yellow background. The words GO WACKO are quite prominent on the packaging.

12 The next use of the words GO WACKO relied upon as use as a trade mark, is in the expression DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS which appears on the front of Effem's packaging. It is possible for a word or words forming only part of a composite expression to be used as a trade mark. Examples are found in Kolotex Glo Australia Pty Ltd v Sara Lee Personal Products (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 1 (" Kolotex ") and Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 242. There are also cases in which a word (which is a registered trade mark) appears in an expression used by an alleged infringer where it has been held that such use does not constitute infringement.

<text>28 This leads to a consideration of whether Wandella's registered mark, WHACKOS, is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to Effem's two registered marks, for the purposes of s 44 as well as s 60. The deceptive similarity issue (but not substantial identicality) was raised in relation to both grounds and is essentially the same. The proper approach to considering deceptive similarity is well settled. It involves a comparison between Wandella's registered mark and an imperfect recollection of Effem's marks and whether there is a real and tangible danger of consumers being led to believe that Wandella's goods came from the same source as Effem's goods: Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 73 ; (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 595.

29 Firstly, I consider whether Wandella's mark is deceptively similar to the SCHMACKOS mark. The type of products which Wandella proposes to sell using the mark WHACKOS closely correspond with the type of products sold by Effem. They are "similar goods" as required by s 44(1)(a)(i) and defined in s 14(1). It can be anticipated that Wandella would use the mark selling products in the same way as Effem presently sells its SCHMACKOS products, namely, in supermarkets and pet shops where the consumer selects the products from a shelf. Other methods of sale may be deployed by Wandella.

30 Wandella's mark WHACKOS would probably be viewed by the consumer as a made up word, as would clearly be the case with Effem's mark, SCHMACKOS. I accept that there are similarities both visual and aural between the two marks, WHACKOS and SCHMACKOS. Effem's submission was that Wandella's mark naturally broke into two components. The first was WH, which was a soft consonant "breathed" when spoken and visually registered in the mind as soft and subservient, more a breath than a sound. The second element was the ACKO, which could be treated as having two syllables (separated by a hard consonant) or a single syllable. Both words involved a distinctive sounding combination, with short vowel sounds at the beginning and end separated by the hard consonants. The ACKO completely dominated the total mark aurally. The final S of SCHMACKOS was not significant as it was clearly a plural form. It was accepted, however, that the first component SCHM was more significant visually than the shorter WH.</text>

<text>12 The next use of the words GO WACKO relied upon as use as a trade mark, is in the expression DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS which appears on the front of Effem's packaging. It is possible for a word or words forming only part of a composite expression to be used as a trade mark. Examples are found in Kolotex Glo Australia Pty Ltd v Sara Lee Personal Products (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 1 (" Kolotex ") and Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 242. There are also cases in which a word (which is a registered trade mark) appears in an expression used by an alleged infringer where it has been held that such use does not constitute infringement. Pepsico was such a case. Before discussing the two authorities where words within an expression were used as trade marks, it is desirable to refer to the judgment of the High Court in Mark Foy's Ltd v Davies Coop and Company Ltd [1956] HCA 41 ; (1956) 95 CLR 190.

20 Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd is a more recent authority. It concerned the alleged infringement of the applicant's registered mark, LIVING WATER. The applicant had used the mark in relation to water produced by its "Wellness water filter". One of the classes in respect of which the mark was registered was Class 32, which covers "bottled water, spring and mineral water". The respondent advertised, distributed and sold its bottled water by reference to "Pro-Bio Living Waters". One issue was whether the expression used by the respondent constituted a single mark or two marks. Bennett J concluded that the words "Living Waters" were used by the respondent as a trade mark in itself. This conclusion was partly based on the way in which the expression was graphically represented. Bennett J accepted the applicant's submission that "Pro-Bio" had been deliberately created as an embellished mark on bottles and signs, while "Living Waters" was more understated. There were differences in font, style and size of the two components. The two components performed quite distinct and separate functions. "Pro-Bio" was used to identify the source of the product range. "Living Waters" was used as a secondary mark in respect of the products that formed part of the respondent's Living Waters' bottled water range. Bennett J concluded that "Pro-Bio" was used to denote the company that was the origin of the "Living Waters" range.

21 In the present case, the words said to be an unregistered trade mark, GO WACKO, appear in the expression DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS on the front of the packaging. There is a natural connection within the entire expression between GO and WACKO and that latter word loosely rhymes with SCHMACKOS later in the expression. This rhyming gives prominence to the words WACKO and SCHMACKOS particularly when spoken. However the entire expression appears in a black border against a yellow background which tends to integrate the expression and focus attention on it as a whole. Also the expression is significantly less prominent than the obvious indicator of the nature and source of the goods, the word SCHMACKOS, which appears elsewhere on the front of the packaging in much larger text, again in a black (and thicker) border with the bright yellow background. That word tends to dominate the front of the packaging though often in association with the description of the specific product and an image of a dog. I do not think the words GO WACKO in the expression on the front of the packaging would be taken to be a signifier of the source of the goods by a person looking at the packaging. Again I have had regard to the repetition of the words on the back of the packaging and their use in advertising to which I now turn.

22 The advertising relied on by Effem was television advertising. A DVD recording of twelve advertisements was tendered by Effem. However, ultimately only seven of the advertisements were relied on to demonstrate, amongst other things, the use of the words GO WACKO as a trade mark. The titles of the advertisements relied on were: "Vet", "Crackle 'N' Crunch", "Bath", "Tea party", "Things that go bump", "Builder's mate", "Sing" and "Be nice to cat". Each of the advertisements involved a story acted out by speaking clay animation figures together with voice-overs. It is unnecessary to describe each advertisement in detail, as all except "Be nice to cat" had a very similar format. The six with the common format involved a story generally which developed, with minor variations, in a sequence.

23 There is an opening scene or scenes involving a dog and its owner which create a context in which the dog is asked to do something. In the advertisements listed (excluding "Be nice to cat"), this is to submit to an examination by the vet, take a bath, participate in a child's tea party, investigate noises caused by an intruder, retrieve a dropped hammer and sing a song. In each instance, the dog shows great reluctance to do the requested act. A person then seeks to induce the dog to do the act by offering food but is unsuccessful. The dog is then offered a SCHMACKOS product which is referred to by name in the voice-over, having the effect of highlighting the offering of a SCHMACKOS in contrast to the earlier offering. The dog is then given SCHMACKOS by a person, who refers to the product as a SCHMACKOS.

24 An image of the packaging is then shown, generally taking the form discussed earlier in relation to the actual packaging but with the word SCHMACKOS appearing in exaggerated form. The dog responds positively and vigorously and does what had been requested in an exaggerated way. The advertisement concludes with a jingle sung as a voice-over, with the words DOGS GO WACKO, DOGS GO WACKO, FOR SCHMACKOS. The way it is sung, the first two phrases are sung quickly, with no discernible prominence given to the words GO WACKO. The word SCHMACKOS is emphasised by being drawn out and sung in an exaggerated warbling voice. At about the same time, the words DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS appear as a superimposed graphic. The "Be nice to cat" advertisement ends slightly differently, not with the jingle but with a song sung more slowly and concluding with the lines I'D GO WACKO WITHOUT SCHMACKOS AND YOU.</text>
