<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Foodcorp Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 796</tocase>
<text>22 The present application does not call for a detailed discussion of the principles that govern the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 436B(2) of the Act. The reason is that, in my view, on any approach, the discretion should be exercised in favour of the granting of leave for the Liquidators to appoint themselves as administrators. The main question under s436B(2) of the Act is whether the Court is satisfied that the liquidator is an appropriate person to be appointed as administrator. After all, a liquidator is at liberty under s 436B(1) of the Act to appoint another person as administrator without the necessity of leave: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Foodcorp Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 796 ( Foodcorp) ; Re Cobar Mines Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) (1998) 30 ACSR 125; John R Turk &amp; Sons (Artarmon) Pty Ltd v Newmont Television Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 622 ; Nardell Coal Corporation Pty Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (in liq) (2003) 47 ACSR 122. It has been suggested, however, that the Court should also have in mind considerations of commercial morality: see Re Data Homes Pty Ltd (in liq) [1972] 2 NSWLR 22; Re Depsun Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 644; Foodcorp at 798-9.</text>

26 It would be wasteful to put the Liquidators to that effort and expense, having regard to the fact that the members of the committee of inspection in the liquidation have unanimously supported the Proposal, in general, and, in particular, the re-appointment of the Liquidators as administrators for the purpose of advancing it. For this reason I made the order sought under s 447A of the Act. I note that such an order has been made in somewhat similar circumstances in Re Cobar Mines Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) (1998) 30 ACSR 125; John R Turk &amp; Sons (Artarmon) Pty Ltd v Newmont Television Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 622 and Re Nardell Coal Corporation Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) (2003) 47 ACSR 122.</text>
