<tocase>Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/151.html</AustLII>
<text>24 In this case there appeared to be limited material before the Minister as to the best interests of each of the applicant's children under the age of 18. Ms Wheatley for the Minister submitted that there was no obligation on the Minister to initiate further inquiries as to information concerning the children, and indeed this point was not in contention: cf Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314, Taylor [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] , Yalniz v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 426 at [24] . Relevant material before the Minister in relation to the applicant's case, which is also before me, included:
 
 
 &#8226; from the Issues Paper, information including:
 o the applicant has four children under the age of 18
 o one child, Darryl Holani is autistic 
 
 
 
 
 o the applicant has an order of the court dated 15 October 2003, allowing him regular contact with his children Darryl and Nikita, "at all reasonable times as may be agreed between the parties" but on no less than four days per fortnight 
 
 
 
 
 o according to Ms Susan Amery, the mother of Joshua: 
 
 
 
 
 "Clyde is a wonderful &amp; loving father. Our son and he are very close. The bond they enjoy is enormous and I fear the Joshua will not be able to understand or cope with suddenly losing someone who is such a big part of his life. He look (sic) up to his father and loves him so much."
 
 o it was open to the Minister to find from the information given that the cancellation of the applicant's visa and his removal from Australia would have a detrimental effect on his younger children 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a submission from the applicant wherein, inter alia , the applicant stated that:
 o if his visa were removed his children would suffer the consequences
 o he had duties towards his children 
 
 
 
 
 o there was a very close and strong bond between himself and his children 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a submission from Larni Holani in support of her father, indicating a close relationship with her father. In that letter Ms Holani made no reference to access or living arrangements except to say that her mother has raised her, as has her father (RBRD 1 p 244)
 &#8226; a submission from Leonard Holani, a child of the applicant over 18 years of age, dated 6 October 2006 wherein Mr Holani stated that his five brothers and sisters all relied on the applicant either financially or emotionally, and that "I believe my youngest brothers and sisters would be affected the most as they are still quite young and need a father figure in their lives as does any child" (RBRD 1 p 245)
 &#8226; a submission from James Gordon Wallace dated 1 October 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 248-249) wherein Mr Wallace states that, inter alia , the applicant is a doting and loving father of six children, and that, with respect to the children under 18 years,
 "Larni Holani, his eldest daughter, presently attends the Carina San Sisto Girls College and again Clyde Holani has paid for her schooling.
 Darryl Holani is autistic, attends a special school and needs the ongoing support of his father. Nakita [sic] and Joshua Holani attend a public primary school prior to receiving a private school education ostensibly to be funded by their father should he still reside in Australia."
 
 &#8226; a submission from Sqn Ldr S J Curran (Rtd) dated 25 September 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 254-255) containing the following:
 "His elder daughter is Larni born 2 November 1989 completes year 12 this year.
 Three younger children are:
 Darryl born 21 November 1996
 Nakita [sic] born 31 March 1998
 Joshua born 22 August 2000
 Clyde paid for his children's education to ensure they would have a good future.
 The four younger children show great affection for their father. I think I recall I said in my last letter it would be heartbreaking to separate the children from their father, particularly as their biological mother shows little affection toward them.
 Clyde's partner Vicky Wallace has been living with him since 2000. She is very good with the young children and it is obvious that they are also very affectionate toward her."

29 Second, while it appears that there was no evidence before the Minister as to the living arrangements of Larni and Joshua, and no evidence as to access arrangements, the highest at which any assumptions of the Minister could be put was that the Minister had erred in fact, and as a general rule the Court has no jurisdiction in relation to such an error. No submissions were made that any errors were jurisdictional errors. In any event, as pointed out by Ms Wheatley, no submissions were made by the applicant through his Counsel, that the living and access arrangements in respect of Larni and Joshua were such that the Minister had clearly erred in reaching his decision. In the language of the Full Court in Taylor [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] :
 
 If the material on those matters was sparse or absent, the circumstances were not such as to oblige the Minister to procure the expansion of that material. It was readily within the power of the appellant to have done so. (cf Djalic 139 FCR at 314)</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/568.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister refers to the children cumulatively, singling out only one child (Darryl Holani). This in itself would not necessarily mean that the Minister has not taken into account the best interests of each of the applicant's children, in particular Larni and Joshua as submitted by the applicant, if the reasons of the Minister indicated that their interests had been taken into account: cf Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 292; Burchett J in Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1998) 150 ALR 608 at 614, Lei Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 at [283] .
 Primary consideration

23 The key issue in this case is whether, in making findings concerning the best interests of Larni and Joshua, the Minister has in fact given the best interests of the children "proper, genuine and realistic consideration" (Branson J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 631; Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [34] ).
 Material before the Minister

30 In my view this not a case where the interests of Larni and Joshua are "dismissed with...almost perfunctory curtness" (cf Burchett J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 614). Further, this is not a case where the Minister has failed to identify anywhere in his Statement of Reasons what the best interests of the children indicated that he should decide with respect to the applicant's visa (cf Branson, North and Stone JJ in Lei Wan [2001] FCA 568 at [26] - [27] ): the Minister clearly stated that the best interests of the children required that the applicant's visa not be cancelled. The only real information of relevance before the Minister concerning Larni and Joshua other than their ages concerned their close relationship with their father and the support he provided them, and this issue was clearly taken into account.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/13.html</AustLII>
<text>11 It is not in dispute that, in making his decision, the Minister was bound to take into account as a primary consideration the best interests of the children of the applicant under the age of 18. Failure to do so as a primary consideration would result in the decision of the Minister being affected by jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lorenzo [2005] FCAFC 13 at [57] - [58] .

12 Guidance for decision-makers in making decisions to refuse or cancel a visa under s 501(2) is found in the Minister's "Direction under section 499 - Visa Refusal and Cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act - No 21" ("Direction No 21"). Although not binding on the Minister himself, the Minister indicated at para 5 of the Statement of Reasons that he had followed his usual practice and proceeded in accordance with Direction No 21. It is not in dispute that it is relevant for the Minister to have regard to the contents of Direction No 21 in making his decision.

13 Paragraph 2.3 of Direction No 21 states the primary considerations for the decision-maker in respect of a decision to refuse or cancel a visa:
 
 "2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations: 
 
 (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community;
 (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and
 (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>10 It is not in dispute that the Minister's decision is a privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474(2) , or at least a purported privative clause decision within the meaning of s 5E. The Federal Court therefore has original jurisdiction in relation to this decision in accordance with s 476A of the Act . However, the jurisdiction of the Court is limited to the same as the jurisdiction of the High Court under para 75(v) of the Constitution (s 476A(2)). Accordingly, in this case the Court can only set aside the Minister's decision for jurisdictional error: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506-508 and 511 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 172 at [8] . An error of fact which may have been made by the Minister is not reviewable by this Court unless it relates to a jurisdictional fact or is a manifestation of some error of law, substantive or procedural, which constitutes jurisdictional error and thereby vitiates the purported decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351-352 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [53] .</text>

<text>22 In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister states that he gave primary consideration to the best interests of the children and that he gave that consideration "substantial weight". The weight given by the Minister to a relevant factor can not be the subject of judicial review: Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] . However the issue of whether the Minister actually undertook the task is a matter for this Court. As noted by Toohey J in Turner v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 35 ALR 388 at 392:
 
 "In many cases it will be clear whether or not the decision maker has taken a relevant consideration into account. That is not to say that the mere assertion by the decision maker that he has done so will conclude the matter. It may be possible to demonstrate from a consideration of all the reasons leading to the decision, or indeed from the decision itself, that a consideration has not been taken into account in any real sense. Conversely the omission of an express reference to some consideration will not lead inevitably to a conclusion that it was not taken into account. An examination of the reasons for decision and of the decision itself may justify the inference that it was ." (emphasis added)
 (cf Branson J in Vaitaiki 150 ALR at 631)

24 In this case there appeared to be limited material before the Minister as to the best interests of each of the applicant's children under the age of 18. Ms Wheatley for the Minister submitted that there was no obligation on the Minister to initiate further inquiries as to information concerning the children, and indeed this point was not in contention: cf Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314, Taylor [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] , Yalniz v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 426 at [24] . Relevant material before the Minister in relation to the applicant's case, which is also before me, included:
 
 
 &#8226; from the Issues Paper, information including:
 o the applicant has four children under the age of 18
 o one child, Darryl Holani is autistic 
 
 
 
 
 o the applicant has an order of the court dated 15 October 2003, allowing him regular contact with his children Darryl and Nikita, "at all reasonable times as may be agreed between the parties" but on no less than four days per fortnight

 "Clyde is a wonderful &amp; loving father. Our son and he are very close. The bond they enjoy is enormous and I fear the Joshua will not be able to understand or cope with suddenly losing someone who is such a big part of his life. He look (sic) up to his father and loves him so much."

Relevant material before the Minister in relation to the applicant's case, which is also before me, included:
 
 
 &#8226; from the Issues Paper, information including:
 o the applicant has four children under the age of 18
 o one child, Darryl Holani is autistic 
 
 
 
 
 o the applicant has an order of the court dated 15 October 2003, allowing him regular contact with his children Darryl and Nikita, "at all reasonable times as may be agreed between the parties" but on no less than four days per fortnight 
 
 
 
 
 o according to Ms Susan Amery, the mother of Joshua: 
 
 
 
 
 "Clyde is a wonderful &amp; loving father. Our son and he are very close. The bond they enjoy is enormous and I fear the Joshua will not be able to understand or cope with suddenly losing someone who is such a big part of his life. He look (sic) up to his father and loves him so much."
 
 o it was open to the Minister to find from the information given that the cancellation of the applicant's visa and his removal from Australia would have a detrimental effect on his younger children 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a submission from the applicant wherein, inter alia , the applicant stated that:
 o if his visa were removed his children would suffer the consequences
 o he had duties towards his children 
 
 
 
 
 o there was a very close and strong bond between himself and his children 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a submission from Larni Holani in support of her father, indicating a close relationship with her father. In that letter Ms Holani made no reference to access or living arrangements except to say that her mother has raised her, as has her father (RBRD 1 p 244)
 &#8226; a submission from Leonard Holani, a child of the applicant over 18 years of age, dated 6 October 2006 wherein Mr Holani stated that his five brothers and sisters all relied on the applicant either financially or emotionally, and that "I believe my youngest brothers and sisters would be affected the most as they are still quite young and need a father figure in their lives as does any child" (RBRD 1 p 245)
 &#8226; a submission from James Gordon Wallace dated 1 October 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 248-249) wherein Mr Wallace states that, inter alia , the applicant is a doting and loving father of six children, and that, with respect to the children under 18 years,
 "Larni Holani, his eldest daughter, presently attends the Carina San Sisto Girls College and again Clyde Holani has paid for her schooling.
 Darryl Holani is autistic, attends a special school and needs the ongoing support of his father. Nakita [sic] and Joshua Holani attend a public primary school prior to receiving a private school education ostensibly to be funded by their father should he still reside in Australia."
 
 &#8226; a submission from Sqn Ldr S J Curran (Rtd) dated 25 September 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 254-255) containing the following:
 "His elder daughter is Larni born 2 November 1989 completes year 12 this year.
 Three younger children are:
 Darryl born 21 November 1996
 Nakita [sic] born 31 March 1998
 Joshua born 22 August 2000
 Clyde paid for his children's education to ensure they would have a good future.
 The four younger children show great affection for their father. I think I recall I said in my last letter it would be heartbreaking to separate the children from their father, particularly as their biological mother shows little affection toward them.
 Clyde's partner Vicky Wallace has been living with him since 2000. She is very good with the young children and it is obvious that they are also very affectionate toward her."</text>
