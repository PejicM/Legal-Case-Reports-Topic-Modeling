<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1167.html</AustLII>
<text>18 The decision of the Registrar to accept or reject an application is a purely administrative function, the decision depending upon whether or not such application satisfies the prescribed criteria ( Gudjala People #2 v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 1167 at [15] ). Similarly, the decision by the Registrar or his delegate that he is, or is not, satisfied of the requirement under s 190C (4)(b) is an administrative decision under the Act . As French J said in Strickland v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1530 ; (1999) 168 ALR 242 at 261 in relation to the concept of "satisfaction" of the Registrar under s 190B , 
 There is scope for evaluative judgment in an expeditious administrative process carried out by people with relevant specialist experience. It is not for the Court, in reviewing the Registrar's decision, to substitute its own view of the sufficiency of the native title rights and interests for those of the Registrar unless it can be shown that the Registrar's state of satisfaction is based upon some error of principle.</text>

<tocase>Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/1384.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In my view the applicant's argument confuses the terms of ss 190C (2) and 190C (4)(b). While there is obvious intersection between ss 190C (2) and (4), the matters of which the Registrar is required to be satisfied by each section are, in my view, quite different. In relation to s 190C (2), the Registrar must be satisfied as to the contents of the application and that it contains information required by ss 61 and 62 (cf Mansfield J in Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112 at [35] ), whereas in relation to section 190C (4) the Registrar must be satisfied as to the identity of the claimed native title holders including the applicant.

30 The applicant relied on Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112 , where I note Mansfield J held in relation to s 190C (2)
 In my judgment, s 190C(2) relevantly requires the Registrar to do no more than he did. That is to consider whether the application sets out the native title claim group in the terms required by s 61. That is one of the procedural requirements to be satisfied to secure registration: s 190A(6)(b). If the description of the native title claim group were to indicate that not all the persons in the native title claim group were included, or that it was in fact a sub-group of the native title claim group, then the relevant requirement of s 190C(2) would not be met and the Registrar should not accept the claim for registration... It is not suggested that the face of the application in this matter raises such difficulties. (at [36])

31 However while Doepel may be authority that, for the purposes of section 190C (2), the Registrar is not required to look beyond the terms of the application (cf Wakaman People No 2 v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 1198 ; (2006) 155 FCR 107 at 118), it does not necessarily follow that the same principle applies to the satisfaction required of the Registrar or his delegate by s 190C (4)(b). Indeed in the Wiri #2 Application, although the delegate was not satisfied as required by s 190C (4)(b), after considering each of the requirements of ss 61 and 62 the delegate was satisfied that the Application contained all the details and other information required by those sections, and accordingly complied with s 190C (2). With specific reference to the native title claim group, the delegate observed :
 There is nothing on the face of the description of the persons in the native title claim group to indicate that not all persons in the native title claim group are included in the description or that it is in fact a sub-group of the native title claim group for the area of the application. Having said that, I do have regard to information elsewhere before me in relation to this issue in my consideration of the authorisation condition under s. 190C (4)(b). But with the authority of Doepel in mind, I do not consider this information under this condition...

33 In my view the applicant is incorrect in submitting that Doepel is authority that, once the Registrar is satisfied of those matters under s 190C (2), in the case of an uncertified application the requirements of s 190C (4)(b) are met by the Registrar being satisfied that the claim group described in the application authorised the making of the application.

35 In that case an application was made by Mr Quall which stated that the native title claim group were eight "members of the Danggalaba Clan" who were all members of the one family. O'Loughlin J held that the delegate had erred in accepting the relevant application for registration. As his Honour pointed out, although the persons who claimed to be the native title claim group also claimed to be members of the Danggalaba Clan, they did not claim to be the only members of that Clan (at [40]). Further, as his Honour noted, it was apparent to the delegate that the family of eight was not the native title claim group - but, at most, only part of the relevant group (at [60]) - which comprised approximately 140-150 people. His Honour quashed the decision of the delegate on the basis that it should not have been accepted for registration. On reviewing the decision it is clear that his Honour was correct for at least two reasons relevant to the application before me - namely that:
 
(i) the description of the native title claim group in the application before his Honour - clearly on its face a sub-group of a larger clan - did not comply with s 61 (1) and hence could not be satisfactory to the delegate for the purposes of s 190C (2); and 
 
(ii) because on the material before the delegate it was clear that the delegate could not be satisfied within s 190C (4)(b) that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group.</text>

<tocase>Risk v National Native Title Tribunal (2000) FCA 1589 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1589.html</AustLII>
<text>11 The submissions of the applicant in relation to grounds 1 and 2 can be summarised as follows :
 
 
 &#8226; The delegate misconstrued the principles set out in Risk , and, as a consequence, erroneously considered that she was required to adjudicate between differing descriptions of a native title claim group, and make a factual determination as to the "correct" description of the group. This function is reserved for the Court in native title proceedings;
 &#8226; The delegate, because of her misconstruction of the principles in Risk , failed to appreciate that, in so far as the registration test is concerned, an assessment of the composition of a native title claim group is a function of the duty contained in s 190C (2), not s 190C (4)(b), and is limited to an assessment of the description of the claim group as it appears in the application and accompanying material; and
 &#8226; Having been satisfied that the requirements of s 190C (2) were met, the only matter which the delegate was required to be satisfied of in relation to section 190C (4)(b) was whether the claimant group, as it was described in the Wiri #2 Application, had authorised the making of the application.

12 In summary, the Registrar submitted in reply that s 190C (4)(b), on its proper construction, required the delegate's satisfaction that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group (as that phrase is defined in ss 253 and 61 (1) of the Act ) and this requirement involved consideration of the composition of the native title claim group. In other words, the Registrar's role goes beyond merely accepting the correctness of an applicant's assertion that the persons who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold communal rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed are confined to those named or described in the application.

13 The term "native title claim group" for the purposes of the Act is defined by s 253 which, so far as relevant, reads:
 native title claim group means : 
 
 (a) in relation to a claim in an application for a determination of native title made to the Federal Court - the native title claim group mentioned in relation to the application in the table in subsection 61 (1)
 ...

34 Finally, I do not accept the applicant's argument that the delegate misconstrued the decision of O'Loughlin J in Risk v National Native Title Tribunal (2000) FCA 1589.

35 In that case an application was made by Mr Quall which stated that the native title claim group were eight "members of the Danggalaba Clan" who were all members of the one family. O'Loughlin J held that the delegate had erred in accepting the relevant application for registration. As his Honour pointed out, although the persons who claimed to be the native title claim group also claimed to be members of the Danggalaba Clan, they did not claim to be the only members of that Clan (at [40]). Further, as his Honour noted, it was apparent to the delegate that the family of eight was not the native title claim group - but, at most, only part of the relevant group (at [60]) - which comprised approximately 140-150 people. His Honour quashed the decision of the delegate on the basis that it should not have been accepted for registration. On reviewing the decision it is clear that his Honour was correct for at least two reasons relevant to the application before me - namely that:
 
(i) the description of the native title claim group in the application before his Honour - clearly on its face a sub-group of a larger clan - did not comply with s 61 (1) and hence could not be satisfactory to the delegate for the purposes of s 190C (2); and 
 
(ii) because on the material before the delegate it was clear that the delegate could not be satisfied within s 190C (4)(b) that the applicant was authorised to make the application by all the other persons in the native title claim group.

36 So explained, the finding of the delegate in the matter before me - relying on Risk - that she was satisfied of the Application's compliance with s 190C (2), but not satisfied of its compliance with s 190C (4)(b), is correct. Further, I do not agree with the submission of the applicant that it was clear from O'Loughlin J's reasons that, notwithstanding the continued existence of the dispute between the relevant parties, if the purported native title claim group in the Quall application had been differently framed, the delegate could, lawfully, have accepted the application for registration. On the contrary - in my view it is clear from his Honour's reasons that not only did the evidence indicate that the applicant was not authorised by all the other persons in the native title claim group, but a reframing of the application by the applicant to so contend (when he was clearly not authorised) would not have allowed the delegate to accept the application for registration (see in particular his Honour's comments at [63]-[66]).

37 Accordingly, in my view grounds 1 and 2 of the applicant's claim cannot be substantiated.

38 Ground 3 of the applicant's claim relates to grounds 1 and 2, and raises no additional issues. This is clear from the terms of ground 3 itself, and the submission of the applicant that, had the delegate not misdirected herself regarding the principles in Risk , she would have been satisfied that the requirements of s 190C (4)(b) were met.

39 I have already considered the decision of the delegate in relation to her state of satisfaction under s 190C (4)(b), and found that no error was made in the delegate's reasons for decision.

40 Like grounds 1 and 2, this ground also fails.
 
THE COURT ORDERS THAT:
 
1. The application be dismissed.

 I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

<tocase>Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/652.html</AustLII>
<text>1 I have before me an amended application by Len Watson, Vassa Hunter and Nancy Riehl jointly on behalf of the Wiri People ("the applicant") to review a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Native Title Registrar ("the Registrar") not to accept the Wiri People #2 Claimant Application (QUD 6251 of 1998) ("the Wiri #2 Application") for registration under section 190A Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act "). The decision was made by the delegate on 24 May 2007. The jurisdiction of the Court to review a decision of the Registrar not to accept a claim for registration is enlivened by s 190D of the Act , with the Court being seized of broad powers pursuant to that section ( Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 at 49-50).

2 The relief sought by the applicant is as follows :
 
A. An order setting aside the decision of the Registrar to not accept the Wiri #2 Application for registration effective as from 24 May 2007
 
B. An order directing the Registrar to accept the Wiri #2 Application for registration and include in the Register of Native Title claims details of the application with effect from 24 May 2007
 
C. Such other orders as the Court thinks just and necessary.

3 The Wiri #2 Application was first entered on the Native Title Register on 2 April 1998. The application covered a broad area of country in Central Queensland, the eastern boundary of which abutted and extended to offshore islands beyond the coastline to the north and south of Mackay and the western boundary of which was located well inland of the coastline.

17 Reading together ss 190A (6) and 190C (4)(b), the logical conclusion is that, unless the Registrar or his delegate is satisfied that the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the other persons in the native title claim group, the Registrar or his delegate must not accept the claimant application for registration. The information which the Registrar or his delegate can consider in making a decision as to whether the claimant application should be accepted is defined broadly by s 190A (3), and includes not only information contained in the application and other documents provided by the applicant (s 190A (3)(a)), but also any information obtained by the Registrar as a result of any searches conducted by the Registrar of registers of interests (s 190A (3)(b)). The breadth of the information the Registrar can take into account pursuant to s 190C (4)(b) was recognised by the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland at 52

19 Further, the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 at 53, in considering the state of satisfaction required under s 190C (4)(b), agreed with French J that the decision of the Registrar or his delegate should stand if the decision was reached on material available to the Registrar's delegate, and it was not shown that the delegate had been informed by any error in principle in so doing.

20 In the circumstances of this case the delegate, inter alia :
 
 
 &#8226; was informed by the Central Queensland Land Council that, pursuant to s 203BE of the Act , it had certified another claim of the Wiri People, which overlapped and competed with the Wiri #2 Application, namely the Wiri Core Application;
 &#8226; considered anthropological reports attached to the Wiri Core Application supporting the existence of wider native title claim group than identified in the Wiri #2 Application;
 &#8226; after searching the Tribunal records, noted that the Wiri #2 Application and the Wiri Core Application were but two of a number of applications that had been made over the years by differently described or differently composed groups of Wiri People; and
 &#8226; noted that the meeting notice for the authorisation meeting for the Wiri #2 Application invited only the very persons ultimately described as the native title claim group in the Wiri #2 Application.

21 In these circumstances, it was open to the delegate to find that the relevant native title claim group was larger than the group identified in the Wiri #2 Application. The finding of the delegate that she was not satisfied that the applicant was authorised to make the application and deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other persons in the native title claim group was, in my view, available on the material.

22 In relation to grounds 1 and 2 of the applicant's claim I consider that the applicant has itself misconstrued the basis of the delegate's decision, and incorrectly described the principles on which the delegate was required to make her decision. I take this view for the following reasons.

23 First, as I have already observed, s 190C(4)(b) does not confine the Registrar or his delegate to the statements made in the affidavit or the information provided in the application in reaching the relevant state of satisfaction : Western Australia v Strickland at 52. The existence and nature of, and information in, the Wiri Core Application, which had been before the Native Title Tribunal previously, was both available to the delegate and relevant to her consideration of whether the applicant in the Wiri #2 Application was authorised to make the application on behalf of all the other persons in the native title claim group.

24 Second, in written submissions the applicant contended that the delegate erroneously considered that she was required to adjudicate between differing descriptions of a native title claim group, and make a factual determination as to the "correct" description of the group. However, it is clear from reading the delegate's Reasons for Decision that the delegate carefully avoided making such a determination. Indeed, the delegate clearly stated that :
 the identity or composition of the Wiri People native title claim group is an intractable dispute of many years standing.... The dispute amongst those who claim to be Wiri is not one that I can decide or resolve in the course of this administrative decision as it is not my role to determine the identity of all the persons who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed in the area of this application.

25 While the delegate did consider at some length the fact, and nature, of the Wiri Core Application, there is no indication the delegate was adjudicating between that group and the group identified in the Wiri #2 Application. As I have already found however, it was open to the delegate, in reaching her decision under s 190C (4)(b), to take into consideration, inter alia , the existence of that overlapping and competing application, the fact that the native title claim group it described was broader than the description in the Wiri #2 Application, and the fact that it had been certified pursuant to s 203BE by the Central Queensland Land Council.

28 Fourth, I do not accept the applicant's argument that s 190C (4)(b) restricts the Registrar to considering whether he is satisfied that the applicant is authorised to make the application by the persons described in the application as the native title claim group. Indeed, this argument runs contrary to findings in other cases, including that of the Full Court (endorsing the decision of French J) in Western Australia v Strickland , that the Registrar or his delegate is not confined in s 190C (4) to statements made in the affidavit or the information in the relevant application.</text>
