<text>1 This matter involves an appeal from a decision of Raphael FM in Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FMCA 274. The appeal is listed for hearing on Tuesday 16 September 2008. The appellants have applied by notice of motion filed on 5 September 2008 to adjourn the hearing of the appeal. The order sought is that the hearing of the notice of appeal listed for 16 September 2008 be adjourned pending the fitness of the first appellant, Ms Klewer, to attend Court. In affidavits in support of the motion, Ms Klewer has stated that she is unable to deal properly with the hearing of the main proceedings due to her poor health. She also states that the second appellant, her son, is disabled and unable to participate in the proceedings.

2 Ms Klewer says that when she is exposed to stressful situations, such as court hearings, her chest tightens and restricts her breathing in a way similar to a cardiac event. She states that she has been hospitalised on various occasions as a result of this condition, that she is under the care of various doctors and that she has not been able to appear or file submissions in this matter.

3 The medical evidence presented by Ms Klewer in support of her claims describes the symptoms related by Ms Klewer to the various doctors and the findings of those doctors following their examinations of her. It is clear from the medical reports provided to the Court by Ms Klewer that the doctors who have examined her have not been able to find any structural cardiac reasons for the symptoms that she describes. The conclusion that the various medical practitioners draw regarding Ms Klewer's chest pains is that the symptoms seem to be stress-related or, possibly, in the case of one opinion, that they are caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux. I note that the medical treatment for Ms Klewer's health problems is ongoing. There is reference to other medical problems but they are not the basis of the application for the adjournment of the hearing.</text>
