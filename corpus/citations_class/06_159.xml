<text>5 With that in mind, the matter was adjourned to enable consideration to be given to a cure for that. I have now received written undertakings along the lines of those accepted by Barrett J in Brolrik Pty Ltd v Sambah Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1171 ; (2001) 40 ACSR 361 particularly at [49]. The effect of those undertakings to the Court are to ensure that what were described as the subordinated liabilities will be in truth subordinated to the claim of any unsecured creditor.</text>
