<text>8 This appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM was set down for hearing on 7 November 2007. On that occasion the appellant made an application that I disqualify myself from hearing the matter. No proper basis was made out as to why I should disqualify myself ( BRGAB of 2007 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1748 at [12] ).

9 The appellant then applied for an adjournment.

10 For the reasons in BRGAB [2007] FCA 1748 at [18] [25], the oral hearing continued as scheduled on 7 November 2007. The appellant chose not to make oral submissions on this occasion or to sit in the Court to hear the oral submissions made on behalf of the Minister ( BRGAB [2007] FCA 1748 at [22] ) to which she could later respond in writing.

11 I granted the appellant an extension of time in which to file and serve her written submissions after the hearing. The appellant subsequently made two requests that this time be extended on the basis of her incapacity to prepare those submissions because of her mental state. One of those requests was accompanied by a medical certificate. I granted the appellant extensions of time on both occasions. On the occasion of the last extension which was not as lengthy as that sought, the Court notified the appellant that no further extensions of time would be granted. No written submissions have been received from the appellant. On the extended day on which those submissions were due, the appellant sought a further extension. She now says that she now wishes to forward the Federal Magistrate's judgment to counsel who may be interested in her case and requests that the Court makes an Order 80 referral to that counsel.

12 The matter was set down for hearing and orders were made to file submissions on 2 August 2007. The appellant's submissions were due to be filed by 30 October 2007. The hearing was scheduled for 7 November 2007. Since the hearing, the appellant has had over one month in which to file written submissions, being submissions that should have been filed prior to the hearing. That is, the appellant has had four months in which to prepare and file her submissions.

15 The appellant appeared in person before the Federal Magistrate. She prepared and relied upon detailed written submissions in relation to that application. Those detailed contentions of fact and law are before me. The appellant drafted the notice of appeal herself and, as she acknowledged at the hearing, the grounds of that notice reflect the grounds of the application that had been advanced before his Honour ( BRGAB [2007] FCA 1748 at [19] ).

16 At the hearing before the Tribunal, the appellant abandoned the grounds set out in her application for the protection visa that were based on her ability to continue then current litigation in Australia. She advanced two new claims with which the Tribunal dealt:
 
 &#8226; A media release issued by the Australian Federal Police on 31 July 2006 in relation to charges brought against the appellant had been reported in Japan ('the AFP media release'). The Japanese authorities were aware of the fact that the appellant had been charged with criminal offences. The appellant was concerned about the effect of this media release in Japan where 99.8% of defendants who appeared before a judge in criminal cases were found guilty.
 &#8226; There had been entries posted on an Internet bulletin board in Japan ('the bulletin board') that said that the appellant must be a Korean or that she should be a Korean. She feared persecution based on the statement that she was of Korean nationality. She also told the Tribunal that the bulletin board was not the cause of persecution but evidence of it.

17 The Convention ground relied upon by the appellant was nationality: a Japanese who had been charged with a criminal offence. The appellant said that the Japanese government would not be interested if she were a national of another country. The Tribunal rejected this as a basis for Convention-based persecution. It concluded that, if she were stopped or interviewed at the airport on return to Japan as the appellant said she feared, or if she were subsequently required to report to the authorities, the essential and significant reason would not be her nationality but the fact that she had been charged with criminal offences in Australia. This would also be the reason for any impact on her access to employment as a scholar in Japan and on her ability to travel overseas.</text>

<tocase>BRGAB of 2007 v MIAC [2007] FMCA 823</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/823.html</AustLII>
<text>7 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal decision in relation to her application for the protection visa in the Federal Magistrate's Court ( BRGAB of 2007 v MIAC [2007] FMCA 823). Federal Magistrate Jarrett dismissed the appellant's application to set aside the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

33 Federal Magistrate Jarrett cited the Tribunal reasons and found that the Tribunal did not fail to consider the appellant's case that she might be considered by some in Japan to have been convicted of, or guilty of, the offences of which she was charged in Australia ( BRGAB [2007] FMCA 823 at [35] ). The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal concluded that she would not suffer ' serious harm ' even if that assumption were made. Failure to refer to the specific evidence of the detail of Japanese criminal law and procedure did not reveal error. Federal Magistrate Jarrett pointed out at [37] that, with respect to the claim that the Tribunal failed to make a finding as to the chance of prosecution in Japan, no offence was identified and the Tribunal was not obliged to accept speculative assertions unsupported by evidence.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>34 I respectfully agree with the Federal Magistrate. It is clear that the Tribunal did consider each of the issues it was required to consider for the purposes of making a decision. Section 430(1)(c) of the Act requires the Tribunal to set out the findings which it made and which it considered to be material. It does not oblige the Tribunal to make findings on every question of fact which is objectively material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [9] and [67] [68]). There is no jurisdictional error in circumstances where the Tribunal has not specifically made mention of a particular piece of evidence in its reasons. As Jarrett FM said at [36], ' the case put by the [appellant] was considered, but rejected, by the Tribunal '.

35 This ground of appeal has not been established.

36 The appellant's complaint is that the Tribunal failed to identify the relevant principles for the determination of a particular social group within the meaning of Article 1A(2) of the Convention. The Tribunal did not discuss the principles of such determination. Federal Magistrate Jarrett pointed out at [38] that the appellant did not put her case on the basis that she was a member of a particular social group. The Minister concedes that the Tribunal did not follow the usual course when determining whether a group or class to which an appellant claims to belong is capable of constituting a particular social group under the Convention; namely whether there is an identifiable social group and whether the appellant is a member of such a group.</text>
