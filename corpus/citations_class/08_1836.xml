<text>28 Zinifex became aware of these proceedings when it was served with the application and statement of claim in December 2007. It sought a determination that the applicant was not empowered to bring the current proceedings. I decided that objection adversely to Zinifex: Smith v Zinifex Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 532. After that decision was handed down Zinifex co-operated with the enforcement authority and has agreed to these facts without the need for a trial. Although the Zinifex objection failed, it was clearly arguable and not an exercise in delay or obstruction.

29 In my opinion the foregoing facts would provide some mitigation for the contraventions by Zinifex. The contraventions were not the implementation of a deliberate policy, but rather arose out of a reaction to the particular circumstance created by the TIC decision. In the light of Zinifex's industrial history and the fact that it no longer has any connection with Smelter, there is not a substantial need for specific deterrence in this case. On the other hand, the contraventions are of a law regarded seriously by the Parliament, as the maximum penalties indicate. General deterrence is relevant. I think in all circumstances the penalties sought to be imposed are reasonable.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.
