<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<text>9 Only the first two of these causes of action are relied upon by the Applicants in a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief against the Respondents. The Respondents have sought to meet that claim for interlocutory injunctive relief not by the giving of particular undertakings but rather by submitting that, having regard to the principles which attend the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief, no claim for such relief is made out. Those principles are not in doubt. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 at 81-82, [65], Gummow and Hayne JJ, with whom Gleeson CJ and Crennan J agreed in this regard (at 68, [19]) stated:
 
 "The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618. This court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued: 
 
 
 
 'The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to a relief ... The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which is the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.' 
 
 
 
 By using the phrase 'prima facie case', their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial."

10 Whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction requires the exercise of a discretion informed by the application of these principles to the circumstances of the case as revealed by the material before the court at the time of the application.

11 The Applicants' claim for infringement of copyright is not, in my opinion, a strong one on present materials.</text>

<tocase>Coco v A.N. Clark (Engineers) Limited [1969] RPC 41</tocase>
<text>25 The elements of a claim in equity for the protection of confidential information are well settled. A person seeking such protection must be able to prove the following:
 
 &#8226; precisely what constitutes the information sought to be protected;
 &#8226; that a necessary quality of confidentiality reposes in that information;
 &#8226; that the information was received by the person against whom equitable relief is sought in such circumstances as to impart a duty of confidence; and
 &#8226; that there is an actual or a threatened breach of that duty of confidence in respect of the information. 
 See Coco v A.N. Clark (Engineers) Limited [1969] RPC 41 at 48; Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 at 443.</text>

26 Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 is also pertinent for the reminder given by Gummow J (at 443) as to the need in relation to a claim like the present for a plaintiff to be able to identify with precision, rather than in global terms, that which is said to be the confidential information.

27 Copies of certain drawings were exhibited to affidavits on behalf of the Applicants. An inspection of these discloses title blocks in which Linmac's name and ownership is stated. There is though, no overt claim of confidentiality or even copyright on the face of the drawings. Neither is there evidence of any written confidentiality agreement ever used at any stage by an alleged owner of the drawings in dealings with third parties.

28 There is evidence of a practice adopted by Linmac of allowing third parties to have copies of such drawings of its plans as where necessary in order to effect repairs. At best, it might perhaps be inferred that, as a matter of business practice, it was mutually understood as between Linmac or its alleged successive assignees and third parties that the drawings contained at least some confidential information.</text>

<tocase>Liberty Financial Limited v Scott (No 2) [2005] VSC 26</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSC/2005/26.html</AustLII>
<text>29 Even assuming this is in favour of the Applicants, it is still necessary that there be some evidence of a misuse of the information. In Liberty Financial Limited v Scott (No 2) [2005] VSC 26 at [7] , Arthur J cited with approval an observation made by Whitford J in Reinforced Plastics Applications (Swansea) v Swansea Plastics and Engineering Co Limited (1979) FSR 182 at 182:
 
 "It is not really to be contemplated that proceedings of this kind should be allowed to go forward on nothing more than a speculative basis; and unless the plaintiff can show that he has some basis for a reasonable belief in his assertion that the defendants are making use of his confidential information, then the action can only be characterised as speculative and fishing, and ought not, in my judgment, to be allowed to proceed. It must be something more than a mere assertion."</text>

<tocase>Ocular Sciences Limited v Aspec Vision Care Limited [1997] RPC 289</tocase>
<text>30 Another cautionary note was sounded by Laddie J in Ocular Sciences Limited v Aspec Vision Care Limited [1997] RPC 289 at 359:
 
 ".. it is well recognised that breach of confidence actions can be used to oppress and harass competitors and ex-employees. The Courts are therefore careful to ensure that the plaintiff gives full and proper particulars of all the confidential information upon which he intends to rely in the proceedings. If the plaintiff fails to do this the Court may infer that the purpose of the litigation is harassment rather than the protection of the plaintiff's rights and may strike out the action as an abuse of process." 
 
 .

31 The Respondents do not seek that the proceedings be struck out. That is not to say that the sentiments voiced in the passages just quoted are irrelevant. The First Respondent is certainly embarked upon a path that may see it come to be a competitor of the Applicants. It is a serious thing to allege that persons have breached a duty of confidence in respect of confidential information. There is force, in my opinion, in the Respondents' submission that there is no evidence that any of them have misused or are going to misuse any confidential information of the Applicants. It must be observed as well that similar difficulties to those which I have highlighted in relation to the breach of copyright claim attend the proof of the Applicants' ownership of the allegedly confidential information. Further, just what is said to constitute the information having the necessary quality of confidence is not identified with precision on the present state of the evidence. That in itself is telling as a person to whom injunctive relief is granted ought not be put in a position of doubt as to what is enjoined.

32 In short then it seems to me that, on the present state of the materials, the basis for there being a serious question to be tried is at least weak but better regarded as wanting.</text>

<tocase>Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Laboratories Pharm-a-Care (1995) 31 IPR 445</tocase>
<text>36 There is an interplay so far as the grant of interlocutory relief is concerned between the strength an applicant's claim that there exists a serious question to be tried and the balance of convenience: see for example Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Laboratories Pharm-a-Care (1995) 31 IPR 445 at 455. That interplay does not, in my opinion, tell in favour in the Applicants.

37 For these reasons, I decline the application for interlocutory injunctive relief. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
