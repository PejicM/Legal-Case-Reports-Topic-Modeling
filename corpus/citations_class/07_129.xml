<tocase>Darwin Broadcasters Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 21 FCR 524</tocase>
<text>4 On the hearing there was some discussion as to whether the 21 day period expires today 7 February 2007 or tomorrow 8 February 2007. The period of 21 days expires today, 7 February 2007 because references in statutes to periods 'beginning on' or 'commencing on' a particular day or date, are calculated on the basis that that day or date is counted as the first day of the period: Darwin Broadcasters Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 21 FCR 524 at 526-527; Watson v Uniframes Limited (1994) 55 FCR 556 at 560; Re Madden (1996) 131 FLR 430 at 432-434. Neither s 105 of the Act nor s 36(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) is relevant, because they are concerned with the expressions 'before' and 'after' (s 105) and 'from' (s36(1)). I note, however, that the line of authority in the cases just cited is consistent with s 3(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which provides that where an Act or instrument is expressed to come into operation 'on' a particular day, it shall come into operation 'immediately on the expiration of the last preceding day'. Similarly, the 21 day period here began immediately on the expiration of 17 January 2007 and ends immediately before the beginning of 8 February 2007.</text>
