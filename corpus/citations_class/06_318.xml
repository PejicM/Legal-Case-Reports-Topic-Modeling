<tocase>Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283 ; (2003) 134 FCR 16</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/283.html</AustLII>
<text>93 The Validation of Titles and Actions Act 1994 (NT) was amended by the Validation of Titles and Actions Amendment Act 1998 (NT) (the ' Amendment Act (NT) ') to include provisions to the same effect as ss 23D and 23DA of the NTA : see now Validation Act , ss 9JA, 11. The Amendment Act ( NT ) came into force on 1 October 1998. The enactment of these provisions allows the Territory to legislate to the same effect as s 23C of the NTA in respect of previous exclusive possession acts attributable to the Territory: NTA , s 23E.

94 The Validation Act adopts the meaning of 'previous exclusive possession act' given in s 23B of the NTA , 'which meaning in so far as it relates to the Territory is set out in Schedules 1 and 2 to the [ Validation Act ]': s 3A(1). In the event of any inconsistency between the Schedules to the Validation Act and s 23B of the NTA, the latter prevails: s 3A(2).

95 Schedule 1 to the Validation Act provides that an act is a 'previous exclusive possession act' if 'it is valid (including because of Division 2 ... of Part 2 of the Commonwealth Act' ). This definition is identical to s 23B(2)(a) of the NTA, except for the addition of the bolded words. It will be seen that Schedule 1 does not refer to an act which is valid because of the operation of s 4 of the Validation Act . According to the applicants, it follows that a past act which was invalid because of the existence of native title, but was validated by s 4 of the Validation Act , is not a previous exclusive possession act. The respondents take a different view of the effect of the definition in Schedule 1 (see section 26.1.1, below) .

548 The Commonwealth recognises that if the right to protect sites is merely intended to encompass a right to control the ceremonial activities of other Aboriginal people, Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283 ; (2003) 134 FCR 16 (' Ward (FC) (No 2) ') supports the proposition that the right could survive the grant of a pastoral lease. Mr Hughston formally submitted that, in this respect, Ward (FC)(No 2) was incorrectly decided.

549 Otherwise the Commonwealth appears to accept that the non-exclusive rights claimed by the applicants, if they existed as native title rights and interests, were not extinguished by the grant of the pastoral leases.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/226.html</AustLII>
<text>28 However, a Full Court of this Court has held that the transitional provisions of the NTAA 1998 do not require a claim made before the commencement of that Act to comply with the new authorisation requirements, at least in the absence of a material change in the composition of the compensation claim group: Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77, at [84], per Stone J; De Rose v South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 (' De Rose (FC) (No 1) '), at [26]-[28], per curiam . The respondents do not suggest that the Application changed the compensation claim group in a manner that required the applicants to comply with s 61(1) and s 61(3) of the NTA (as amended). Nor has any suggestion been made that the applicants' attempt in final submissions to further amend the Points of Claim requires compliance with s 61(1) and s 00061(3) of the NTA. Accordingly, no issue arises concerning authorisation of the compensation claim.</text>

<text>677 Dr Perry relied on authorities that establish that a registered proprietor under the Real Property Act of an estate or interest in land acquires an indefeasible title to that estate or interest notwithstanding that the dealing pursuant to which registration was obtained was void: Breskvar v Wall [1971] HCA 70 ; (1971) 126 CLR 376 at 385-386, per Barwick CJ; Hillpalm Pty Ltd v Heaven's Door Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 59 ; (2004) 220 CLR 472, at [52], per McHugh ACJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ. Dr Perry submitted that the fact the grant of the fee simple estate or lease (in the case of CL 256) was invalid by reason of the operation of s 10(1) of the RD Act does not prevent the grantee obtaining an indefeasible title upon the estate or interest being brought under the Real Property Act , just as a person registering a forged transfer obtains an indefeasible title to the registered estate provided he or she acts without fraud: Frazer v Walker [1967] AC 589; Breskvar v Wall , at 385-386, per Barwick CJ.</text>

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>300 A failure to cross-examine a witness on contentious issues may have at least two consequences: Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553, at 587, per Samuels JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed). First, the so-called rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, which reflects a principle of procedural fairness, may prevent the cross-examining party asking the court not to accept the evidence of the witness on that particular issue: J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence (6 th Aust ed, 2000), at [17460]. Secondly, the failure to cross-examine may provide a cogent reason for accepting the witness's evidence, particularly if it is not contradicted: Precision Plastics Pty Ltd v Demir [1975] HCA 27 ; (1975) 132 CLR 362, at 371. However, there is no rule that evidence which is unchallenged in cross-examination must be accepted by the trier of fact, especially if it appears to be inherently incredible or is contradicted by other credible evidence: Bulstrode v Trimble [1970] VR 840, at 849, per Newton J; Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital , at 586-588, per Samuels JA; Elkington v Shell Australia Ltd (1993) 32 NSWLR 11, at 17, per Kirby ACJ.

301 These authorities demonstrate that, subject to the operation to the rule in Browne v Dunn, a failure to cross-examine a witness does not necessarily mean that the Court is bound to accept the evidence of that witness. Nonetheless, general observations of the kind expressed by Professor Sutton about the reliability of some of his informants cannot substitute for an evaluation of their evidence given on oath or affirmation in open court. Generally speaking, if particular features of the evidence given by indigenous (or other) witnesses have not been challenged in cross-examination, there need to be cogent reasons for rejecting that evidence. An example might be where two Aboriginal witnesses have given contradictory evidence in relation to the same issue, in which case it may be necessary to choose between the two versions. However, the question still remains as to whether the evidence adduced by the applicants is sufficient to establish the essential elements of their case.

302 The Commonwealth tendered statements from seven witnesses as follows:
 
&#8226; Yami Lester, who gave evidence concerning, among other topics, his role as a member of ARAC in 1974-1975, including his participation during that period in site inspections and in consultations with the traditional owners of Uluru.
 
&#8226; Kane Hardingham, who was an Environment Manager with Voyages Hotels and Resorts Pty Ltd, based at Yulara. Mr Hardingham gave evidence that in June 2001 a number of Aboriginal women showed him a site located in a pit within the boundaries of Connellan Airport. He was told that the Two Sisters sat at this site.
 
&#8226; Colin French, a Project Manager with Geoscience Australia, who gave evidence as to whether the sites for a possible airport and town marked on drawings prepared in 1974 corresponded to the sites at which Connellan Airport and the tourist facilities were ultimately constructed.
 
&#8226; Ian Cawood, formerly an Assistant Ranger at Ayres Rock - Mt Olga National Park, who gave evidence of his experiences in the course of his extensive involvement with the area, including his participation in the work undertaken by ARAC from 1974 to 1976. Ian Cawood first arrived at Uluru in 1960 in order to work in the family business, the Ayres Rock Chalet. He remained at Uluru until 1982. For the last 14 years of his stay Mr Cawood worked with Derek Roff as Assistant Ranger at the Ayres Rock-Mount Olga National Park.
 
&#8226; Nicholas Browning, who worked with the Australian Presbyterian Board of Missions at Fregon and Everard Park (Mimili) for various periods from 1966-1974 and thereafter with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Alice Springs (1974-1981). Mr Browning gave detailed evidence of his work with ARAC and his involvement in consultations undertaken through that body in order to identify and locate Aboriginal people with interests in and around Uluru. Mr Browning knew Paddy Uluru and Reggie Uluru during his time at Fregon and Mimili. Mr Browning acquired fluency in the Yankunytjatjara, Pitjantjatjara and Luritja languages.
 
&#8226; Ivan Cebelo, who was employed in the construction of Connellan Airport from December 1995 until December 1996. Mr Cebelo gave evidence that the registered site now known as Katartitja was excavated in 1996. Mr Cebelo also authenticated contemporary photographs of the site and the surrounding area.
 
&#8226; Creed Lovegrove, who was Director of Welfare in the Northern Territory (1972-1974) and subsequently Director of Aboriginal Affairs (NT) (1974-1977). Mr Lovegrove gave evidence of his role in the consultations carried out under the auspices of ARAC in 1974 and 1975.
 
Three of these witnesses, namely Messrs Lester, Browning and Cawood, were cross-examined.

303 The Commonwealth submits that the evidence of the seven witnesses who provided statements is supported by contemporary documentary evidence (such as the records of ARAC) and corroborated by a number of witnesses called on behalf of the applicants, including some senior Aboriginal people. According to the Commonwealth, the evidence establishes the following propositions:
 
&#8226; the Commonwealth's decision to establish the Town of Yulara was made in deference to Aboriginal concerns over the presence of tourist facilities in close proximity to Uluru;
 
&#8226; the site for the Yulara township and airstrip was decided upon following extensive consultations with local Aboriginal people and with other senior Aboriginal people from the region;
 
&#8226; the site for the Yulara township and airstrip was agreed upon and approved by the Aboriginal people who were consulted;
 
&#8226; particular care was taken to ensure that the site for the proposed township and airstrip did not contain any culturally sensitive areas, such as sacred sites; 
 
&#8226; at the date when Aboriginal approval was obtained for the location of the proposed township and airstrip, the Application Area did not contain any culturally sensitive areas, such as sacred sites; and
 
&#8226; at the time Julia Munster and Kevin Murphy (both of whom were anthropologists engaged by the Central Land Council) carried out a cultural survey in 1996 of the proposed extensions to the airstrip and associated works, there were no culturally sensitive areas or sacred sites within the airport and, in particular, within the site of the proposed works.</text>

<text>707 The Self-Government Act was enacted pursuant to s 122 of the Constitution , which empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to 'make laws for the government of any territory ...': Capital Duplicators Pty Ltd v Australian Capital Territory [1992] HCA 51 ; (1992) 177 CLR 248, at 265-266, per Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ. The Self-Government Act came into force on 1 July 1978, as did the Self-Government Regulations.

708 Section 5 of the Self-Government Act established the Northern Territory of Australia 'as a body politic under the Crown'. Subject to the Self-Government Act , the Legislative Assembly has power with the assent of the Administrator or the Governor-General, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory: ss 6, 13.

709 Section 57(1) of the Self-Government Act gives all laws of the Territory in force on 1 July 1978: 
 
 'the same operation as they would have had if [the Self-Government] Act had not been enacted, subject to alterations or repeal by or under an enactment'.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1904/12.html</AustLII>
<text>729 In one of its earliest decisions, the High Court applied a longstanding rule of construction that statutes 'are not to be construed as interfering with vested interests unless that intention is manifest': Clissold v Perry [1904] HCA 12 ; (1904) 1 CLR 363, at 373, per Griffith CJ. In that case, the High Court held that a person who had a mere possessory interest in land, having entered as a trespasser, nonetheless had a statutory right to compensation upon the land being resumed. The principle stated in Clissold v Perry has subsequently been applied in many cases. As Professors Pearce and Geddes point out (S tatutory Interpretation in Australia (5 th ed, 2001), at [515]-[517]), the principle has two aspects. Legislation is presumed not to authorise the acquisition of property rights without adequate compensation; and legislation is presumed not to interfere with vested property rights.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/666.html</AustLII>
<text>570 The Commonwealth cites several first instance decisions as authorities to the contrary of Ward (FC) (No 2) . Leaving aside the fact that I am bound by Ward (FC) (No 2), each of these cases is distinguishable. In Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 298 , Cooper J was concerned with native title rights over certain waters which rights were expressed to be good against all the world other than people exercising public rights of fishing, navigation or innocent passage, or other rights lawfully conferred by statute. Cooper J, with respect, correctly considered that a formulation in these terms amounted to an attempt to control access to and use of the land in a manner that was inconsistent with the reasoning in Ward (HC) : see at [188]. Lardil Peoples v Queensland did not involve any native title right of the kind dealt with either in para 5(e) of the determination in Ward (FC) (No 2) or in the determination made in De Rose (FC) (No 2). Similarly, the passages cited from Daniel v Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 , at [134]-[136], and Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 , at [475], do not directly bear on a native title right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of land by Aboriginal peoples bound by traditional laws and customs.</text>

<text>279 Dr Willis has given evidence as an expert anthropologist in other proceedings, including De Rose v South Australia [2002] FCA 1342 (' De Rose (FCA) '). Initially, the applicants indicated that they wished to rely on Dr Willis' report as that of an expert containing the opinions of an anthropologist with specialist knowledge of the people of the eastern Western Desert. Ultimately, however, the applicants did not persist with that approach and tendered his statement simply as an account of his own observations and experiences as an initiated Pitjantjatjara man. This approach had the necessary consequence that some opinions expressed by Dr Willis were not admitted into evidence, since he was not put forward as a person having specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience for the purposes of s 79 of the Evidence Act .</text>

<tocase>De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/110.html</AustLII>
<text>560 A number of other propositions were endorsed in Ward (HC). They were recently summarised in De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose (FC) (No 2) '), at [145], as follows: (the references are to paragraphs in Ward (HC) ).
 
 
 
 
 '(i) Native title rights and interests are properly to be seen as a bundle of rights, the separate components of which can be extinguished separately (at [76]-[77]). 
 
 (ii) Where a grant of rights in land is made pursuant to statute, the question (so far as extinguishment is concerned) is whether the rights are inconsistent with native title rights and interests in respect of the land [(at [214])]. This is an objective inquiry which requires identification of and a comparison between two sets of rights, one deriving from traditional laws and customs and the other from 'the new sovereign authority that came with settlement' (at [78], [82]). Reference to the use of land is relevant only to the extent that it focuses attention upon the rights pursuant to which the land is used (at [78]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) Rights held under an interest in land less than a fee simple estate, such as a lease, can be inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests and therefore can extinguish them (at [80]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) There is no such thing as degrees of inconsistency of rights: 
 
 
 
 "Two rights are inconsistent or they are not. If they are inconsistent, there will be extinguishment to the extent of the inconsistency ... Absent particular statutory provision to the contrary, questions of suspension of one set of rights in favour of another do not arise " ( at [82]). (Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 (v) Section 23G(1)(b)(i) of the NTA contemplates that a previous non-exclusive possession act, such as a pre- RD Act pastoral lease, may grant rights and interests that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests and extinguish the latter (at [192]; see, too, Wilson v Anderson, at [46]). Where that occurs, no question of suspension of native title arises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) Section 23G(1)(b)(ii) of the NTA addresses the case where there is an inconsistent grant of rights which, apart from the NTA and its State [or Territory] counterpart, would not extinguish native title rights and interests. The example given is a post-1975 grant which, by operation of the RD Act , was ineffective to extinguish native title rights and interests (at [82]). (This seems to involve reading the expression "the grant of rights" in s 23G(1)(b) as including a purported grant, given that the RD Act would, apart from the NTA , presumably render the grant invalid.)' 
 

To these six propositions derived from Ward (HC) two others can usefully be added:
 
 
 (vii) Reference to the use of land in the context of extinguishment may distract attention from the true inquiry, namely whether rights have been created in third parties that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. Use of land may suggest, or even demonstrate, that such rights have been created, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not use (at [215]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (viii) The metaphor of a 'bundle of rights' is useful in two respects: 
 
 
 'It draws attention first to the fact that there may be more than one right or interest and secondly to the fact that there may be several kinds of rights and interests in relation to land that exist under traditional law and custom' (at [95]). (Emphasis added.)</text>

The following interests were protected from s 69 of the Real Property Act : the interest of any person in adverse possession of the land (or part of it); an 'omitted' easement (which expression encompasses an easement which is simply not on the register: Dobbie v Davidson (1991) 23 NSWLR 625, at 627; Williams v State Transit Authority of NSW [2004] NSWCA 179 ; (2004) 60 NSWLR 286 at [105] [109], per Mason P); the interest of a proprietor of land included in a certificate of title by wrong description; public rights of way and easements enjoyed by the public; and a short-term lease held under an unregistered instrument or agreement.</text>

<text>750 As I have noted, prior to the 1998 amendments, the NTA did not affect an act that was valid when done and which was effective at the time it was done to extinguish or impair native title. In Mabo (No 2), the High Court recognised that in Australia native title to land survived the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty (at 69, per Brennan J). From the outset, however, the High Court accepted that native title rights and interests:
 
 'are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. They can also be terminated by other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown'.

<tocase>Fejo v Northern Territory (1998) 152 ALR 477</tocase>
<text>757 I note in passing that at the time the 1997 Explanatory Memorandum was circulated (9 March 1998), litigation was under way to challenge the apparently clear proposition that the grant of a freehold estate in land necessarily extinguished all native title rights and interests in that land. The challenge had failed in the Federal Court on 27 February 1998 ( Fejo v Northern Territory (1998) 152 ALR 477), but in early March 1998 an appeal from this decision was apparently in contemplation. Part of that appeal was ultimately removed to the High Court and the challenge was finally rejected by the High Court on 10 September 1998, shortly before the NTAA came into force.

758 The 1997 Explanatory Memorandum stated (par 5.1) that Div 2B was to be inserted in Part 2 of the NTA in order to achieve points 2 and 4 of the 10 Point Plan. Those points relevantly provided as follows:
 
 'Point 2 Confirmation of extinguishment of native title on "exclusive" tenures 
 
 
 
 States and Territories would be able to confirm that 'exclusive' tenures such as freehold, residential, commercial and public works in existence on or before 1 January 1994 extinguish native title. Agricultural leases would also be covered to the extent that it can reasonably be said that by reason of the grant or the nature of the permitted use of the land, exclusive possession must have been intended. Any current or former pastoral lease conferring exclusive possession would also be included. 
 
 
 ... 
 
 Point 4 Native title and pastoral leases 
 
 
 
 As provided in the Wik decision, native title rights over current or former pastoral leases and any agricultural leases not covered under [Point] 2 above would be permanently extinguished to the extent that those rights are inconsistent with those of the pastoralist. 
 
 All activities pursuant to, or incidental to, "primary production" would be allowed on pastoral leases...'</text>

<tocase>Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11 ; (1985) 159 CLR 70</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/11.html</AustLII>
<text>661 The operation of s 10 of the RD Act has been considered in some detail by the High Court in Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11 ; (1985) 159 CLR 70, Mabo (No 1), the Native Title Act Case, and Ward (HC). The propositions set out below are derived from those cases.

662 1. The 'rights' referred to in s 10(1) of the RD Act are human rights, not necessarily legal rights enforceable under municipal law: Mabo (No 1) , at 217, per Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The human rights protected by s 10(1) include those referred to in art 5 of the Convention, notably the right to own and inherit property. That right encompasses an immunity from arbitrary deprivation of property and for this purpose 'property' includes native title rights and interests: Ward (HC), at [116].

663 In the Native Title Act Case the High Court pointed out (at 437) that s 10(1) of the RD Act , confers equality of enjoyment of the human right to own and inherit property on 'persons of a particular race'. Their Honours continued:
 
 'The [RD Act] does not alter the characteristics of native title, but it confers on protected persons rights or immunities which, being recognised by "the tribunals and all other organs administering justice", allow protected persons security in the enjoyment of their title to property to the same extent as the holders of titles granted by the Crown are secure in the enjoyment of their titles. "Property" in the context of the human rights with which we are concerned includes land and chattels as well as interests therein. Where, under the general law, the indigenous "persons of a particular race" uniquely have a right to own or to inherit property within Australia arising from indigenous law and custom but the security of enjoyment of that property is more limited than the security enjoyed by others who have a right to own or to inherit other property, the persons of the particular race are given, by s 10(1), security in the enjoyment of their property "to the same extent" as persons generally have security in the enjoyment of their property. Security in the right to own property carries immunity from arbitrary deprivation of the property. Section 10(1) thus protects the enjoyment of traditional interests in land recognised by the common law'. (Emphasis added.)

664 2. Section 10(1) of the RD Act applies in two different situations, insofar as State laws are concerned. If a State law omits to make a right universal, for example, by failing to confer that right on a person of a particular race, s 10(1) operates to confer the right on a person of that race. In this situation, the right conferred by the RD Act (a Commonwealth law) complements the right created by the State law. Because the RD Act shows no intention to occupy the field for the purposes of s 109 of the Constitution , the provisions of the State law remain unaffected: Gerhardy v Brown, at 98; Ward (HC), at [106]. Thus if a State law provides for the extinguishment of land titles, but provides compensation only in respect of titles other than native title rights and interests, the extinguishment remains valid, but the right to compensation is extended by operation of s 10(1) of the RD Act to the native title holders: Ward (HC) at [108].

665 The second situation is where the State imposes or authorises a discriminatory burden or prohibition, for example a law forbidding people of a particular race from enjoying a human right enjoyed by persons of another race. In this situation, as was pointed out by Mason J in Gerhardy v Brown, at 98-99:
 
 's 10 confers a right on the persons prohibited by State law to enjoy the human right or fundamental freedom enjoyed by persons of that other race. This necessarily results in an inconsistency between s 10 and the prohibition contained in the State [or Territory] law'. 
 

If a State law, for example, extinguishes only native title rights and interests and leaves other titles intact, s 10(1) operates to remove the discriminatory burden of extinguishment. The reason is that the State law, to that extent, is inconsistent with s 10(1) of the RD Act and is rendered invalid by s 109 of the Constitution : Ward (HC), at [108].

666 3. Section 10(1) of the RD Act is directed to the case where some people enjoy rights but others do not enjoy those rights, or do so to a more limited extent. Rights may be enjoyed unequally even if the laws concerned do not have a purpose that can be identified as discriminatory: Ward (HC), at [105]. It follows that s 10(1) does not require that the relevant law, or an act authorised by that law, be 'aimed at' native title rights and interests. Nor does it require the law to make an explicit distinction based on race.

667 Instead, s 10(1) of the RD Act is directed at 'the practical operation and effect' of the impugned legislation and is 'concerned not merely with matters of form but with matters of substance': Ward (HC) , at [115] citing Mabo (No 1), at 230, per Deane J and Gerhardy v Brown , at 99, per Mason J. Consequently, if a power is conferred by legislation which is non-discriminatory on its face and the power is exercised in a manner that is discriminatory as a matter of fact, s 10(1) is engaged: Ward (HC) , at [126].

668 4. Because native title is held by members of a particular race, interference with the enjoyment of native title is capable of amounting to discrimination on the basis of race. In Ward (HC) , it was held (at [122]) that Mabo (No 1) and the Native Title Act Case should be taken as having rejected the proposition that native title can be treated differently from other forms of title simply because it has characteristics different from other property rights and derives from different sources. As was said in Ward (HC) , at [121]:
 
 'the [RD Act] must be taken to proceed on the basis that different characteristics attaching to the ownership or inheritance of property by persons of a particular race are irrelevant to the question whether the right of person of that race to own or inherit property is a right of the same kind as the right to own or inherit property enjoyed by persons of another race. In this respect the [RD Act] operates in a manner not unlike most other anti-discrimination legislation which proceeds by reference to an unexpressed declaration that a particular characteristic is irrelevant for the purposes of that legislation.'

669 It follows that in considering whether the holders of native title do not enjoy the same rights, or enjoy them to a more limited extent, than the holders of other forms of title, s 10(1) of the RD Act does not require a comparison between the content of native title rights and interests and the content of non-native title rights to determine whether they are equivalent. The fact that native title has unique characteristics, including its vulnerability to extinguishment by legislative or executive action, is not a basis for denying the application of the RD Act to native title.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1004.html</AustLII>
<text>38 Prior to 1998, the applicants in native title claims or other litigation under the NTA were not constrained by the rules of evidence. Until the NTAA 1998 substituted a new s 82 for the original version, s 82(3) provided that the Court, in conducting proceedings under the NTA, was not bound by 'technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence'. Section 82(1) of the NTA now provides that the Court is bound by the rules of evidence, except to the extent it otherwise orders. Regrettably, as I observed in an interlocutory judgment in the present case, the applicants paid insufficient attention to the laws of evidence, especially in relation to the so-called Yulara Anthropology Report prepared by Professor Peter Sutton and Ms Petronella Vaarzon-Morel: see Jango v Northern Territory (No 2) [2004] FCA 1004 (' Jango (No 2) '), at [8]. Among other consequences, this has led to an unnecessary increase in the costs of conducting the case.

39 The validation and extinguishment regime established by the NTA , of which the compensation provisions form part, is extraordinarily complex. In this section of the judgment I outline the compensation regime, referring to the validation and extinguishment provisions only to the extent necessary to understand that regime.

40 Section 13(2) of the NTA provides that if the Court is making a determination of compensation in accordance with Div 5 of Part 2 , and an approved determination of native title has not previously been made in relation to the whole or part of the area concerned, the Court:
 
 'must also make a current determination of native title in relation to the whole or the part of the area, that is to say, a determination of native title as at the time at which the determination of compensation is being made'.</text>

<text>124 In 1911, the Acceptance Act came into force. The effect of the surrender of the Northern Territory by South Australia and its acceptance by the Commonwealth was to confer on the Commonwealth Parliament exclusive power to make laws for the government of the Territory: Constitution , s 122 ; Kruger v Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1996) 190 CLR 1, at 49-50, per Dawson J; Ward (HC), at [390]. The Acceptance Act continued all laws in force in the Territory at the time of the acceptance, but provided that all such laws could be altered or repealed under any law of the Commonwealth: s 7. All estates and interests held by any person from the State of South Australia within the Northern Territory continued to be held from the Commonwealth on the same terms and conditions: s 10.

125 The Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910 (Cth) (' Administration Act ') empowered the Governor-General to make ordinances having the force of law in the Northern Territory, although either House of Parliament could disallow an ordinance: s 13. This was essentially the position until 1947, when the Administration Act was amended to create a Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. The Legislative Council was given power to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, subject to the assent of the Administrator and a power of disallowance vested in the Governor-General: Administration Act , ss 4U, 4V, 4W. In 1978, the Northern Territory was established as a body politic under the Crown and the Legislative Assembly was given power to such laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory: Self-Government Act , ss 5, 6.

126 In 1914, according to Mr Tindale, a vast area of South Australia extending north-west from the Victorian border for over 3,200 kilometres, was in a severe drought that lasted until mid-1915. However, because of local summer thundershowers, the situation in the eastern Musgrave Ranges was nearly normal. The drought forced Pitjantjatjara people to the west to shift eastward. By 1916 they had usurped the territory of some Yankunytjatjara people in the eastern Musgraves, in turn forcing them southwards: N B Tindale, Aboriginal Tribes of Australia: Their Terrain, Environmental Controls, Distribution, Limits and Proper Names (Uni of California, 1974), at 69.</text>

<text>570 The Commonwealth cites several first instance decisions as authorities to the contrary of Ward (FC) (No 2) . Leaving aside the fact that I am bound by Ward (FC) (No 2), each of these cases is distinguishable. In Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 298 , Cooper J was concerned with native title rights over certain waters which rights were expressed to be good against all the world other than people exercising public rights of fishing, navigation or innocent passage, or other rights lawfully conferred by statute. Cooper J, with respect, correctly considered that a formulation in these terms amounted to an attempt to control access to and use of the land in a manner that was inconsistent with the reasoning in Ward (HC) : see at [188]. Lardil Peoples v Queensland did not involve any native title right of the kind dealt with either in para 5(e) of the determination in Ward (FC) (No 2) or in the determination made in De Rose (FC) (No 2).

<tocase>Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/23.html</AustLII>
<text>634 The Commonwealth points out that Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 (' Mabo (No 2) '), decided that the extinguishment of native title by a valid exercise of sovereign power inconsistent with the continued right to enjoy native title rights and interests does not entitle the native title holders to compensation. It follows, so it is said, that any general right to compensation must be created by statute. The mere fact that native title has been extinguished does not create a right to compensation. The Commonwealth also says that an act which occurred prior to the enactment of the NTA , which at the time was both valid and effective to extinguish native title, is not affected by the NTA (although the NTA confirms the extinguishment of native title by a valid 'previous exclusive possession act').

635 Assuming (contrary to the Commonwealth's principal submissions and my findings) that the applicants have established the existence of native title rights and interests over the Application Area at the date of the compensation acts, the Commonwealth submits that compensation is payable to them only if:
 
&#8226; the act in question was valid, but a right to compensation was created by s 10(1) of the RD Act so as to confer upon the native title holders the same rights as the holders of other forms of title ( NTA , s 45);
 
&#8226; the act in question was invalid by reason of the existence of native title (being a 'past act' as defined in the NTA , s 228), but was validated by the NTA or equivalent State or Territory legislation ( NTA , s 20); or
 
&#8226; the act was a 'previous exclusive possession act' within s 23B of the NTA which extinguishes native title under Div 2B of the NTA , but only to the extent that native title rights were not extinguished otherwise than under the NTA ( NTA, s 23J).

636 The Commonwealth accepts that the grants of fee simple estates over Crown land within the Application Area do not of themselves extinguish any native title rights and interests that may have survived the grant of the nineteenth century pastoral leases. The same concession is made in relation to CL 256. The concessions are said to be dictated by reasoning in Ward (HC), based on s 10(1) of the RD Act , in relation to certain leases of Crown land in the Territory. The Commonwealth accepts that the circumstances in Ward (HC) cannot be distinguished from those of the present case.

637 Nonetheless, the Commonwealth contends that any surviving native title rights and interests over the Application Area (other than the Lasseter Highway) were extinguished before the NTA or the Validation Act came into force. This result is said to flow from the operation of the so-called indefeasibility provisions of the South Australian Torrens system statute, the Real Property Act which, as amended by Territory laws, was then in force in the Territory. According to the Commonwealth, the Real Property Act conferred an indefeasible title on each grantee which title validly extinguished any surviving native title rights and interests. There was no inconsistency with s 10(1) of the Real Property Act , so it is argued, because the Real Property Act treats unregistered native title rights and interests in the same way as other unregistered interests in land brought under the Real Property Act . I deal with this argument later (see section 24.3, below).

638 The Commonwealth submits that, in these circumstances, native title holders are not entitled to compensation for the extinguishment of their rights and interests over the Application Area. Neither s 20 nor s 23J confers any right to compensation, since the extinguishment took place independently of the NTA and the Validation Act. The Commonwealth also submits that the construction of the Public Works by the Territory validly extinguished any surviving native title rights and interests independently of the operation of the NTA or the Validation Act . Thus no entitlement to compensation arises under the NTA in respect of the extinguishment of those rights and interests.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/38.html</AustLII>
<text>710 Section 50(1) of the Self-Government Act provides that:
 
 'The power of the Legislative Assembly conferred by section 6 in relation to the making of laws does not extend to the making of laws with respect to the acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms'. 
 

Section 50(1) is designed to impose a statutory restriction on the Legislative Assembly similar to the restriction imposed on the Commonwealth Parliament by s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution : Newcrest Mining (WA) Ltd v Commonwealth [1997] HCA 38 ; (1996) 190 CLR 513, at 542-543, per Brennan J. It follows that a law passed by the Legislative Assembly which provides for the acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms will be ultra vires the Legislative Assembly.

711 Part IV of the Self-Government Act is headed: 'The Administration'. Section 31 provides as follows:
 
 'The duties, powers, functions and authorities of the Administrator, the Executive Council and the Ministers of the Territory imposed or conferred by or under this Part extend to the execution and maintenance of this Act and the laws of the Territory and to the exercise of the prerogatives of the Crown so far as they relate to those duties, powers, functions and authorities.' 
 

Section 31 must be read with s 35 of the Self-Government Act , which states that:
 
 'The regulations may specify the matters in respect of which the Ministers of the Territory are to have executive authority.'

712 At all material times, reg 4(1) of the Self-Government Regulations has provided that, subject (relevantly) to subreg (4), the Ministers of the Territory are to have executive authority in respect of a number of matters including the following:
 
 'Matters in respect of which duties, powers, functions or authorities are imposed or conferred by or under another Act in force in the Territory on a Minister or the Territory 
 
 ... 
 
 Land, public and private (including internal waters) 
 
 ... 
 
 Surface transport regulation (including ... roads and bridges ...) 
 
 ... 
 
 Public works.' 
 

Regulation 4(3) states that the inclusion of any matters in subreg (1) 'does not derogate from or affect the generality of any other matter specified in that subregulation'.

750 As I have noted, prior to the 1998 amendments, the NTA did not affect an act that was valid when done and which was effective at the time it was done to extinguish or impair native title. In Mabo (No 2), the High Court recognised that in Australia native title to land survived the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty (at 69, per Brennan J). From the outset, however, the High Court accepted that native title rights and interests:
 
 'are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. They can also be terminated by other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown'.

<text>29 The preamble to the NTA contains what a Full Court of this Court has recently described as the 'moral foundation' on which the legislation rests: Northern Territory v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Group [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 (' Alyawarr Case '), at [63]. The preamble recites the factors that led Parliament to enact the NTA . These include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; the Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of Australia before European settlement;
 &#8226; they have been progressively dispossessed of their lands, largely without compensation; and
 &#8226; as a consequence, they have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society.

30 The intention of the people of Australia is said to be:
 
 
 '(a) to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Act, announced at the time of introduction of this Act into the Parliament, or agreed on by the Parliament from time to time, for securing the adequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and 
 
 (b) to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire.'

31 The Court in the Alyawarr Case observed (at [63]) that the legislative intention to recognise, protect and support native title stands despite the inclusion in the NTA of substantive provisions which are adverse to native title rights and interests and indeed provide for their extinguishment and for the validation of past acts. The competing policies are reflected in the objects of the NTA, stated in s 3 as follows:
 
 'The main objects of this Act are: 
 
 
 
 (a) to provide for the recognition and protection of native title; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) to establish ways in which future dealings affecting native title may proceed and to set standards for those dealings; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) to establish a mechanism for determining claims to native title; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) to provide for, or permit, the validation of past acts ... invalidated because of the existence of native title.'

561 In the Alyawarr Case , decided after argument in the present case had concluded, a Full Court considered the extinguishing effect of pastoral leases that had been granted over the claim area, a large tract of land near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. Most of the leases contained reservations in favour of Aboriginal people in terms similar to those contained in PL 456 and PL 1804 in the present case. None of the pastoral leases remained in force at the time the Alyawarr proceedings were commenced.

562 The following was common ground before the Full Court in the Alyawarr Case :
 
 
 &#8226; The pastoral leases were previous non-exclusive possession acts attributable to the Territory (at [123]).
 &#8226; The right to exclude all others from the claim area was extinguished by the grant of pastoral leases conferring rights inconsistent with the native title right to control access (at [42]).
 &#8226; The applicants retained the rights to hunt, fish and gather on the land, to use the resources of the land (such as food, plants, trees, charcoal, ochre and stone) and to have access to and the use of water on the land (at [121]).

563 The Full Court held that the following rights of the applicants had not been extinguished by the grant of the pastoral leases:
 
 
 &#8226; To live on the land, to camp, to erect shelters and other structures and to travel over and visit any part of the land and waters (at [133]). The Court rejected the Territory's contention that a native title right of permanent settlement was inconsistent with the rights of a pastoral lease holder (at [131]).
 &#8226; To engage in cultural activities, conduct ceremonies and participate in cultural practices on the land. The Court held that this right included the right to teach people on the land about the physical and spiritual attributes of places and areas of importance (at [135]).
 &#8226; To have access to, maintain and protect places and areas of importance on or in the land (at [138], [140]). The Court held that the word 'protect' was appropriate, since it did not imply that the applicants were entitled to exclude others entirely from the relevant places and areas (at [139]-[140]).
 &#8226; To share or exchange subsistence and other traditional resources obtained on or from the land. The Court rejected the applicants' contention that they had a right to trade in the resources of the land, on the ground that the evidence fell short of establishing the existence of any such traditional right (at [157]).</text>

<tocase>Paulette v The Queen [1977] 2 SCR 628</tocase>
<text>687 Callinan J acknowledged that there were Canadian authorities to the effect that caveats could not be lodged to protect Aboriginal title under the Torrens system. However, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Paulette v The Queen [1977] 2 SCR 628, turned on the fact that the land had never been granted by the Crown and was not the subject of any registered title (see Paulette v The Queen, at 630). The decision therefore said nothing about whether native title rights and interests could be protected by caveat after a Crown grant had issued in respect of the land. His Honour considered that other Canadian decisions turned on the particular provisions of the Torrens statutes in force: see Uukw v British Columbia (1987) 37 DLR (4 th ) 408, followed in Skeetschestn Indian Band v British Columbia (Registrar of Land Titles) [2001] 1 CNLR 310 (both decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal).</text>

<text>300 A failure to cross-examine a witness on contentious issues may have at least two consequences: Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553, at 587, per Samuels JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed). First, the so-called rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, which reflects a principle of procedural fairness, may prevent the cross-examining party asking the court not to accept the evidence of the witness on that particular issue: J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence (6 th Aust ed, 2000), at [17460]. Secondly, the failure to cross-examine may provide a cogent reason for accepting the witness's evidence, particularly if it is not contradicted: Precision Plastics Pty Ltd v Demir [1975] HCA 27 ; (1975) 132 CLR 362, at 371. However, there is no rule that evidence which is unchallenged in cross-examination must be accepted by the trier of fact, especially if it appears to be inherently incredible or is contradicted by other credible evidence: Bulstrode v Trimble [1970] VR 840, at 849, per Newton J; Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital , at 586-588, per Samuels JA; Elkington v Shell Australia Ltd (1993) 32 NSWLR 11, at 17, per Kirby ACJ.</text>

<text>275 I set out below the names and brief biographical information concerning the Aboriginal witnesses, based primarily on their own evidence. I refer to these witnesses by their preferred names or by the names used by counsel for the applicants. All but four of the witnesses are identified by the applicants in their proposed amendment to the pleadings as members of the compensation claim group (see par 230, above). The four witnesses who have not been included in the group are Barbara Tjikartu, Dora Haggie Walkabout, Pantjiti Mckenzie and Donald Fraser. I also include some information relating to Yami Lester, a knowledgeable and senior Aboriginal man, who was called as a witness by the Commonwealth.
 
&#8226; Johnny Jango (Jingo) . Mr Jango was Chairperson of the Mutitjulu community at the time of the hearing. He was born between 1939 and 1944 at Maratjurra (Lyndavale Station), roughly 150 kilometres to the east of the Application Area. Mr Jango speaks both Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara, but also understands a number of other dialects. His father, Mick Wilyarti, was a Yankunytjatjara man, born near Yularra Purlka in the Kata Tjurta area. (Professor Sutton acknowledged that he had received contradictory information from Aboriginal people on Mick Wilyarti's birthplace.) Mick Wilyarti's father (Mr Jango's tjamu (father's father)) was Ngiyara and Mick's mother (Mr Jango's kami (grandmother)) was Tjintjiwarra. According to Mr Jango, his mother was born at Kulal, northeast of Docker River, approximately 200 kilometres to the west of the Application Area. His sisters are Millie Okai and Judy Kunmarnarra (Trigger), both of whom gave evidence. Mr Jango met his wife, Elsie Wunatjura, at Areyonga, where he went to school and lived for some time. Mr Jango and Elsie married according to Arnangu law. They have two surviving children, Todd and Rita. (Rita gave evidence, but Todd did not.) Mr Jango first visited Uluru as an unmarried wati (initiated man), when he travelled there with a group of watis. At the time there was no community, but Ian Cawood was operating the Ayres Rock Chalet. Mr Jango left Uluru and worked at many stations in the region, including Erldunda, Jay Creek and Docker River. He returned to Uluru before the 1985 Handback with his wife and two children. At one point in his evidence Mr Jango said that he was ngurraritja for Mutitjulu through his grandmother and also because he had lived there for some time. Later, however, he said that he was ngurraritja for Lyndavale Station and was 'local' for Mutitjulu.
 
&#8226; Judy Kunmarnarra (Trigger). Judy Kunmarnarra (Trigger) is Johnny Jango's sister. She was born in 1954 on the old Palmer Valley Station, which was located near the Stuart Highway east of the Application Area. She grew up on the new Palmer Valley Station, but later moved with her parents to Tempe Downs Station. Like Johnny Jango, she said that her mother, Eunice Nyunitju Intjipati, was born near Docker River and was a Pintjantatjara woman. Her father, Mick Wilyarti, was sometimes called Mintjwarra because he carried a long spear. Judy speaks Pitjantjatjara from her mother and Yankunytjatjara from her father. She married Derek Trigger (deceased), a Luritja man from Haasts Bluff whom she met at Areyonga. Judy has one son, born in 1976, and one grandchild. Judy moved to Mutitjulu in 1985, at about the time of the Handback. She worked for a long time at the Mutitjulu Primary School.
 
&#8226; Millie Okai. Millie Okai is Johnny Jango's 'big sister'. She was born at Lyndavale Station when her parents were working there. Her father, Johnny Nyukarli, was born at Karlaya, near Docker River. Her mother, Wirrika, was born at Pulari (Uluru) and grew up in that area (encompassing Yularra Purlka, Pirurrpa Karla and Ampiyarra). Wirrika was Mick Wilyarti's sister. Millie's maternal grandmother, Tjintjiwarra, was a Yankunytjatjara woman who was born at a place between Mantarurr and Pirurrpa Karla. Tjintjiwarra's first husband was Ngiyarri. After Ngiyarri's death, Tjintjiwarra married Mirruwanti (Ngiyarri's brother). Millie speaks Yankunytjatjara from her mother's side and Pitjantjatjara from her father's side. Millie's first husband was Nelson Okai. Nelson Okai's father was Hawkeye, who had two brothers, Minawara and Carbine. According to Millie, the three brothers' country was at Uluru. Millie first came to Uluru with her first husband. After he died, Millie moved eventually to Mutitjulu, where she married her second husband, Pastor Ezekiel, a Pitjantjatjara man from the Docker River area.
 
&#8226; Rita Jingo. Rita Jingo is Johnny Jango's daughter. Rita was born in 1971 in Alice Springs Hospital. At the time her parents were living at Jay Creek. Rita regards herself as a Yankunytjatjara woman through her father and paternal grandfather, Mick Wilyarti. Rita grew up speaking Pitjantjatjara because people around her spoke that language, but she can still speak Yankunytjatjara. Rita came with her family to Mutitjulu when she was about nine years of age. She attended school at Alice Springs, but visited her parents at Mutitjulu and Yularra Purlka during school holidays. She left school at 15 and has resided at Mutitjulu ever since. Rita's first husband (deceased), with whom she had two children, came from Snake Well in Western Australia. She is now married to Ashley Paddy from the Amata region and they have two children. Rita has worked as a Ranger in the National Park for several years.
 
&#8226; Reggie Uluru . Reggie was born in the late 1930s or early 1940s at Parramita, northwest of Indulkana, in South Australia, on what are now the Arnangu Pitjantjatjara Lands. Reggie's mother, Nancy, was a Yankunytjatjara woman, born at Mimili (Everard Park), to the south of Fregon (which itself is southeast of the Application Area). His father, Paddy Uluru, a Yankunytjatjara man, appears to have been born near Ernabella in South Australia, to the southeast of the Application Area. Reggie's paternal grandfather, Lungkarta, was born at Uluru and is buried there. Reggie's first language is Yankunytjatjara, but he also speaks Pitjantjatjara, Luritja and Arrernte. Reggie's siblings include his younger brother, Cassidy Uluru. Reggie met his wife, Sarah Goodwin, when she was working at Ernabella. Reggie has three children of whom the oldest is Sandra. (Sandra did not give evidence although she is named as a member of the compensation claim group.) From the time he was a young child, Reggie worked at stations with his father. He first went to Uluru as a boy, in the company of his family who hunted and collected food in the area. At that time Bill Harney was working as a Ranger. Reggie returned to Uluru to live long before the Handback, for which he signed many important papers. He worked with Derek Roff as a Ranger for a time. Reggie was a member of the first Board for the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and has served as a member of the Mutitjulu Council.
 
&#8226; Cassidy Uluru. Cassidy Uluru, Reggie's brother, was born in about 1949 at Tjinawakanta, south of Wallatinna in South Australia. Cassidy's father was Paddy Uluru. His mother, Munyi (Molly) Breaden, was born at Mimili in South Australia. Like Paddy Uluru, Munyi Breaden spoke Yankunytjatjara. Cassidy grew up at Mimili where his parents were working, but he attended school for brief periods at Ernabella and Fregon. He first visited Uluru with his family when he was about five years old. At that time, Bill Harney lived in a tent at Uluru and tourists visiting the area overnight stayed in tents. Cassidy met his wife, Tiku, when both were camping at Murtitjulu as children. Tiku was born in Alice Springs and her first language is Pitjantjatjara. Cassidy's language is Yankunytjatjara but he also speaks Pitjantjatjara at home. As a young man and as an initiated man, Cassidy worked on cattle stations including Mimili, where he worked with his father. Cassidy moved to Uluru to live after his mother's death at Mimili, but before his own marriage. At the time, Derek Roff was the Ranger and Cassidy worked with him for wages. Cassidy participated in the Handback ceremonies and still works with the National Park.
 
&#8226; Bessie Liddle. Bessie Liddle was born at Iltjiltjarri near Tempe Downs Station. Her maiden name was Bessie Breaden. Her father, Jason Breaden, was born at Henbury Station. Jason Breaden's father was Alan Breaden, a white man. Bessie's mother, Tjanguwa Okai (also called Glenda Breaden), was born near Tempe Downs Station. Tjanguwa Okai's father was Kanakana Hawkeye, whose main language was Yankunytjatjara. Hawkeye's siblings included Mick Minawara and Carbine, both of whom were born around Uluru, and Ngui Ngui Tjalumi. Hawkeye got his name because he worked as a police tracker. Bessie's family moved around a lot when Bessie was young, as her father was a stockman. Bessie had some schooling at Alice Springs and Hermannsburg. Her father died when Bessie was about 14. After her father's death, Bessie's uncle, Bob Buck, took the family to his station at Mt Quinn. Bessie first visited Uluru in the 1960s with her husband, an Arrernte man (now deceased) who was raised in Alice Springs. Bessie's first language is Luritja, but she speaks Yankunytjatjara from her mother's side and Arrernte from her father's side. However, she gave her evidence without the assistance of an interpreter. In the 1970s Bessie and her family formed the Luritja Land Association to try to regain traditional Luritja lands.
 
&#8226; Nellie Armunta . Armunta was born in the late 1920s at Cave Hill in South Australia, about 100 kilometres south of the Application Area. Her father, Charlie Aluritja, was born at Mantarurr and was a Yankunytjatjara man. (Armunta told Professor Sutton that her father was born at Pirurrpa Karlarrinytja, a short distance to the northeast of Mantarurr.) Charlie Aluritja grew up in the Mantarurr area and around Kata Tjurta and Uluru. Armunta's mother, Murika, was a Yankunytjatjara woman, born at Apu Tjirlpi, near Mulga Park, about 80 or 90 kilometres to the southeast of the Application Area. Armunta's maternal and paternal grandparents were all Yankunytjatjara people. Her paternal grandfather, Purpartu, was born at Pirurrpa Karla, which is close to Mantarurr, and grew up in that area. Her paternal grandmother, Nyapatjarriny, was born and grew up at Ullkiya, to the south of the Application Area in South Australia. Armunta grew up at Mantarurr with her extended family group. The group lived in a traditional manner and hunted for food in many places in the area. Armunta married Dickie Minyintiri, who was born near Piipalyatjarra in Pitjantjatjara country. Although the sequence of events is not entirely clear, Armunta and Dickie lived for a long time at Ernabella and Armunta gave birth to five children in the bush near Ernabella. She also lived with her family at some stage at Mutitjulu, but they left there because they were upset at not getting a house. Armunta now apparently lives at Cave Hill. She has three surviving children, fourteen surviving grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Armunta is a custodian of the site at Katartitja which is registered with the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority. None of Armunta's children gave evidence.
 
&#8226; Windlass Kunmarnarra (Aluritja). Windlass is Armunta's brother. He was born at Wintawarta, west of Amata, close to Cave Hill in South Australia. Windlass' language, like that of his parents, is Yankunytjatjara. He agreed with Armunta that their father, Charlie Uluritja, was born at Mantarurr. According to Windlass, his mother, Murika, was born at Kajikuta, near Amata. Windlass also said that his paternal grandfather, Pupartu, had been born to the east of Docker River at Urilpila. Windlass' wife, who died long ago, was from Karnypi and worked at the Mission School at Ernabella for a long time. All five of Windlass' children were born at Ernabella. As a child, Windlass walked around the Kata Tjurta and Uluru area with his family, although they appear to have spent most of their time at Mantarurr. They camped at different sites in the area including Yularra Purlka, Kurlpi Taltja, Kata Tjurta and Uluru. At some stage, the family travelled to Ernabella where Windlass attended school. After becoming a wati at Ernabella, Windlass hunted for dingo scalps around Mantarurr. As a man, Windlass worked at many stations in the region. He seems to have spent time at Uluru in the 1960s and 1970s, since he worked with Derek Roff and assisted ARAC with some of its work. Windlass said that he took his wife 'back to Mantarurr and [the] Kata Tjurta area', but it is not clear when this happened. Of Windlass' five children only one (Alison Carroll) gave evidence.
 
&#8226; Alison Carroll (Windlass). Alison Carroll's parents are Windlass Aluritja and Tjuwilyi, a Pitjantjatjara woman born southwest of Ernabella. Alison herself was born at Ernabella in 1958 and still lives there. She identifies as both a Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara woman, but speaks mainly the latter dialect. Alison grew up at Ernabella and went to school there. She visited Kurlpi Tjarta as a very young girl for a short period in the company of her family. She would also travel to Mantarurr and Uluru with her father and siblings. As a 15 year-old she visited Uluru. She also visited Mantarurr as an adult in order to learn about the important places. Alison married Pipeye Carroll from 'Papunya, Haast's Bluff Areyonga side'. She and her husband have five children and two grandchildren, all of whom live at Ernabella. Alison serves on the Board of the National Park and also accompanies her father to other meetings.
 
&#8226; Nellie Patterson. Mrs Patterson was born and 'smoked' in about 1938, at Piipalyatjarra, in the Tomkinson Ranges near the Western Australian border. Her Arnangu name is Nula. As a child, she lived mostly around Mantarurr, but the family returned to Piipalyatjarra in order for Mrs Patterson's mother, Mary Angili, to give birth to children. Mrs Patterson's language is Pitjantjatjara, but she speaks Yankunytjatjara and understands Warlpiri and Pintupi. Mrs Patterson's father, Tommy Mungurin, was also born at Piipalyatjarra but lived at Ernabella and Mulga Park. He was a Pitjantjatjara man, as was his father, Katanya (Mrs Patterson's paternal grandfather). Mrs Patterson's mother, Mary Angili was born at or near Umutju, near the Mann Ranges to the southwest of the Application Area. Mary's mother, Mitjunitja, grew up near Umutju. Mrs Patterson married her promised husband Tommy Wongin (deceased) from Karnpi, near Amata. His language was Yankunytjatjara which he got from his father, but he also spoke Pitjantjatjara from his mother's side. Mrs Patterson's son, Matthew, was born in 1983, apparently at Alice Springs. He was smoked in the bush near Amata, where the family was living at the time. As a child, Mrs Patterson walked with her extended family around Mantarurr, Kata Tjurta, Uluru, Yularra Purlka and other places in the area. Sometimes she would travel with Charlie Aluritja and his wife and her (Mrs Patterson's) maternal grandmother, Mitjunitja. Mrs Patterson lived at Mutitjulu with her husband for about 20 years and in the 1980s and 1990s she worked as a Park Ranger. She now lives in Alice Springs for health and family reasons. Mrs Patterson was a member of the Board of Management of the National Park for a long time. She was a founder of the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council. 
 
&#8226; Barbara Tjikartu. Tjikartu was born in about 1938 at Nyira in the Mann Ranges in South Australia, near the Western Australian border. Tjikartu's father, Wangili, was a Pitjantjatjara man who was born at Anumarra Pirti in Western Australia. Her mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman from the Puka Puka area near Piltarti, in the Mann Ranges. Tjikartu's language is Pitjantjatjara. Her maternal grandmother was Pantjiti, whose birth place was Piipalyatjarra in Pitjantjatjara country. Tjikartu married Nipper Winmati (deceased), a Yankunytjatjara man who was born near Docker River. (Millie Okai said that Nipper Winmati in fact was a Pitjantjatjara man.) Because of her marriage, Tjikartu is sometimes known as Barbara Nipper. Tjikartu is the mother of Colin Nipper, who gave evidence, and five other children. Tjikartu is a member of the Board of Management of the National Park. She has been actively involved in the development and operations of the Uluru Cultural Centre. (At an early stage in the proceedings, Mr Parsons said that Tjikartu, although not expressly named in par B1.8 of the Points of Claim, had interests in the area. However, he also suggested that Tjikartu had 'primary central interests elsewhere' and that her main interest in this area was as the mother of children who were members of the compensation claim group. During final submissions, Mr Basten handed up a document indicating that Tjikartu was indeed intended to be a member of the compensation claim group. For some unexplained reason, Tjikartu was excluded from the 'exhaustive' list of claimants embodied in the proposed amendment to par B1.8 of the Points of Claim.)
 
&#8226; Colin Nipper. Colin Nipper is the eldest child of Tjikartu and Nipper Winmati. He was born at a creek near Areyonga in the mid-1950's. At the time, his parents were living in Areyonga and had been for some time. Colin takes his surname from his late father. He speaks Pitjantjatjara, the language he learned at school in Areyonga, but he also speaks Luritja and Arrernte. Colin, whose Arnangu name is Antama, is married to Teresa Nipper, a Pitjantjatjara woman. Her country is Umutju in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory. Teresa has two children by her first husband Billy Wilson (deceased) and four children with Colin. One of Teresa's children by Billy Wilson is Peter Wilson.
 
&#8226; Peter Wilson. Peter Wilson was born in Alice Springs Hospital in 1973. His mother is Teresa Nipper, a Pitjantjatjara speaker from Areyonga. Peter's father, Billy Wilson, left the family when Peter was very young and Peter was raised by his stepfather, Colin Nipper. Peter's paternal grandparents (through his stepfather) are Nipper Winmati and Barbara Tjikartu. Peter was raised as a young child in Areyonga, but was educated in Ballarat (Victoria), Alice Springs and Darwin. After leaving school, he completed a Land Management course at Batchelor College. Peter commenced work in 1994 as a trainee Ranger at the National Park and at the time of the hearing was a Ranger whose responsibilities included the Mala (rufous hare wallaby), Kuniya (python) and Lirru (brown snake) walks at Uluru. Peter's first language is Pitjantjatjara, but he is fluent in English and gave his evidence in that language. Peter is married to an Arrernte woman from the 'right side' and they have three daughters, all of whom were born in Alice Springs Hospital. Peter said in evidence that he would 'lean towards' Docker River (where his 'ancestors' came from) and Areyonga (where he grew up) as his traditional country.
 
&#8226; Malya Teamay. Malya Teamay was born in 1947 at Tjulu (Curtin Springs), which is now located on the Lasseter Highway, east of the Application Area. Malya's mother, Amanyi, came from the Blackstone area in Western Australia. Her language was Ngaatjatjara. Malya's father, Willy Kuntjurmini, was born near Lake Wilson on the borders of Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia. Willy Kuntjurmini spoke Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara. Malya himself grew up speaking Pitjantjatjara, Luritja, Arrernte and Ngaatjatjarra. Malya has been married twice and has four children. He lived in a number of places with his first wife, Mona, and together they conducted a tourist business at Tjulu, on the way to Uluru. Malya first visited Uluru in about 1961, before he had completed wati ceremonies. This was in Bill Harney's time, when Malya's uncle, Snowy Minyintiri, was also working at Uluru. In 1983, Malya was living with his family at Docker River, but took up an opportunity in that year to move to Uluru. He has lived in the area ever since, apart from one period when he lived in Alice Springs. Malya currently resides at Mutitjulu and has served as Chairman of the Mutitjulu Community Council. Malya Teamay is Chairman of the Indigenous Heritage Committee set up by the Park Rangers and has served on the Board of Management for the National Park. 
 
&#8226; Kitty Impana (Collins). Kitty Impana was born at Areyonga in 1953, when her parents, Snowy Minyintiri and Mary Tjingapa, were living there. Impana is a step-sister to Barbara Tjikartu because Tjikartu's mother married Snowy Minyintiri when Impana was small. Snowy Minyintiri was a Nyakatatjara man who also spoke Pitjantjatjara. He grew up near Docker River, where his mother was born. Impana's mother, Mary Tjingapa, a Yankunytjatjara woman, was born at Yulara and is buried at Mutitjulu. Mary Tjinjapa's father (Impana's maternal grandfather) was a Yankunytjatjara man from Kata Tjurta and Titirarra. Impana's first husband died many years ago. Her second husband, Des Kunoth was born at Tjunti and grew up at Angas Downs. He is the father of Impana's two children, one of whom (Raelene) was born on a sandhill near Murtitjulu. 
 
&#8226; Frank Djana. Frank Djana is Kitty Impana's brother. The name 'Djana' was given to him by the missionaries at Areyonga, where he was born. He is also known as 'Dr Frank' because he worked in health care for a long time. According to Dr Frank, his mother, Mary Miyarini, was born at Pirurrpa Karlarrinytja, near Kata Tjurta, and spoke Yankunytjatjara. Dr Frank's father, whom he called Nui Minyintiri, was born west of Docker River, but died at Mutitjulu in 1985. Dr Frank himself was born at Areyonga and became an initiated man there. He first went to Uluru as a married man with children. He moved to Mutitjulu at about Handback time. Dr Frank at one time was the Chairperson of the Mutitjulu Community Council. 
 
&#8226; Ngoi Ngoi Donald. Ngoi Ngoi was born in the bush at Wartarrka (Kings Canyon), at a time when her mother was travelling across country by camel. She received the special name 'Ngoi Ngoi' from her paternal grandmother. Her father was Lively No 1 Palyinjka, Nipper Winmati's brother. Lively No 1 was a Yankunytjatjara man who was born at a women's site near Murtitjulu Springs (Uluru) and grew up at Uluru and Kata Tjurta. Ngoi Ngoi's mother, Imanturra, was born near Docker River and spoke Pitjantjatjara. Ngoi Ngoi grew up speaking that dialect, but says that she identifies as a Yankunytjatjara person notwithstanding that she was born on Luritja country. As a child, Ngoi Ngoi lived with her parents at Areyonga because they could get rations there. She would travel to Mutitjulu by camel 'for holidays'. At that time Bill Harney was living there in a tent. Ngoi Ngoi worked at a motel at Uluru for a short period during Bill Harney's time. She then appears to have lived at Areyonga, although after the Handback she lived with Tjikartu and Nipper Winmati at Ampiyarra. She then went to Mutitjulu where she stayed for a long time before finally returning to Areyonga. Ngoi Ngoi married William Donald, who was born at Waralla, near Angas Downs, and whose language is Pitjantjatjara. Ngoi Ngoi has three children and one grandchild. Although the children were included in the compensation claim group, they did not give evidence. 
 
&#8226; Dora Haggie Walkabout. Dora Walkabout was born at Urrampinyi, on Tempe Downs Station, where her parents were living at the time. Her mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman who was born at Mantapalyka, near Mantarurr Itjinpi. Dora's father, Wintjin Walkabout, was born and grew up near Docker River. Dora's mother died when Dora was young and she was brought up by Tjintjiwarra, who was married to the younger brother of Dora's father. Dora's language is Pitjantjatjara, but she also speaks Arrernte. Dora's first husband was Don Okai, a Yankunytjatjara man born at Maratjarra (Lyndavale). They had six children together. After Don Okai's death, Dora became a co-wife of Stanley Kunmarnarra (deceased) and they had one child together. Stanley Kunmarnarra was born at Urlayipa, near Mulga Park. He was the youngest brother of Nellie Armunta and Windlass Aluritja. Dora has served on the Board of Management for the National Park. In her evidence, Dora claimed to be ngurraritja for Mantarurr, Itjinpi, Mutitjulu, Kata Tjurta, Yularra Purlka and Yulara. Nonetheless, she is not included in the compensation claim group put forward by the applicants in their proposed amendment to par B1.8 of the Points of Claim.
 
&#8226; Pantjiti McKenzie. Pantjiti McKenzie was born and grew up near Blackstone in Western Australia. Pantjiti's father was from the same place, while her mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman from the Lake Wilson area. Pantjiti's main language is Pitjantjatjara from her mother, but she also speaks Ngaatjatjara from her father's side. Pantjitji is married to Simon Mckenzie, who was born at Pulkurru near Mount Conner, about 100 kilometres to the east of the Application Area. The evidence is somewhat unclear, but it appears that Pantjiti and her husband lived in Mutitjulu for many years from the mid 1950s. Pantjiti's son, Jacob, was born at Mutitjulu and lived there until he was aged three. Pantjiti now lives in Alice Springs because of her husband's ill-health. (As I have noted, Pantjiti is not said to be a member of the compensation claim group. Ms Keely explained that Pantjiti was giving evidence because her son, Jacob, is a claimant. However, Jacob did not give evidence and the list of claimants ultimately put forward by the applicants in their proposed amendment to the Points of Claim does not include him.)
 
&#8226; Betty (Biddy) Conway. Betty Conway was born at Tempe Downs in 1956 and grew up at Areyonga where she attended school. Her father, Alec Conway, was born at Tempe Downs, but she was brought up by her stepfather, Big Foot Tjamulmalyi (also called Tjinapulka). Big Foot had two wives, the second of whom was Betty's mother, Ivy Kalykulya, a Yankunytjatjara woman born at Pirurrpa Karla. Big Foot's sister, Eunice, was married to Mick Wilyarti and their children were Johnny Jango and Judy Kunmarnarra (Trigger). Ivy Kalykula's mother was Witjiwarra and her aunt (Witjiwarra's sister) was Mary Miyariny, whose children were Frank Djana and Kitty Impana. Betty does not appear ever to have lived in the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area, having moved from Areyonga to Alice Springs in 1979. However, as a child Betty went to Uluru to visit her brother, Alex Forrester (now deceased), and in more recent times she has visited the area 'a couple of times each year'. Betty had one child with her first husband in 1974. After her first husband's death when their son was a little baby, she married Billy Armstrong, a Pertame man, with whom she had four children. One of their children, Selissa, is a Senior Ranger at the National Park and has lived at Mutitjulu since the age of 16. Betty can speak Yankunytjatjara but has not spoken it a great deal recently. She also speaks Pitjantjatjara and Luritja.
 
&#8226; Nicola Forrester. Nicola Forrester was born in Alice Springs in 1972. She lives in Victoria for family reasons and gave her evidence in English. Ms Forrester's father was Alec (or Alex) Forrester (deceased), a Pitjantjatjara man from the Western Desert. Her mother is Nola Armstrong, an Arrernte woman from Alice Springs whose country is around Finke River. Ms Forrester has five children. She grew up speaking Pitjantjatjara and indeed is an accredited interpreter in that language. She also learned Arrernte from her mother. Ms Forrester lived at Finke and Jay Creek when she was very young and later attended school in Alice Springs, Adelaide and Darwin (Batchelor College). The family visited Uluru often. When Ms Forrester's parents separated, her father moved to Uluru, but the children stayed with their mother. After her marriage at a young age, Ms Forrester lived for a time at Yularra Purlka and thereafter at Mutitjulu. Ms Forrester worked at the National Park for a total of nine years, in the course of which she learned the Tjukurrpa stories from older Aboriginal people and Park staff.
 
&#8226; Donald Fraser. Donald Fraser was born in 1947 or 1948 at Ernabella. His father, Tommy Minyungu, was born at Kurlpi Tjarta and spoke Yankunytjatjara as his main language. Mr Fraser's paternal grandfather, Warawarra, was born at Uluru and thus his country included Uluru and Kata Tjurta. Mr Fraser's mother, Inyalangka, is a Pitjantjatjara woman. Donald lives at Yunyaryni, east of Ernabella (formerly Kenmore Park Pastoral Lease) and has done so since 1978. As a child Mr Fraser moved around with his parents. He started school at age 10 or 11 at Ernabella and became a wati at Areyonga. Mr Fraser visited Kulpi Tjarta when he was very small, travelling on foot or by camel from Ernabella. He later visited Uluru as a wati . Mr Fraser's wife is from Walytja Tjarta in the Mann Ranges. He and his wife have four children. Mr Fraser has been the Chairperson of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park since 2003. He gave his evidence in English. Mr Fraser was not put forward as a member of the compensation claim group, either in the original pleadings or in the proposed amendments to par B1.8 of the Points of Claim. Nonetheless, Mr Fraser claimed that he could speak for Uluru because it was his father's and grandfather's country. He also maintained that he is next in line after Windlass Aluritja and Jim Nyukuti, who was said by Dr Willis to be recognised as ngurraritja for an area to the west of Kata Tjurta, as a senior man for Uluru.
 
&#8226; Julie Clyne. Julie Clyne was born in Alice Springs in 1958. Her father, Ben Clyne, was born in the 1930s, also in Alice Springs. Ben Clyne had a white father but he was raised by Arrapi, a man from the Kata Tjurta area, as Arrapi's son. Ben Clyne's sister was Tintjiwarra. Julie Clyne's mother, Daisy Clyne, was born at Mt Cavenagh Station. As a child, Julie travelled to different stations with her father. When she was 11 years of age she was taken to Amoonguna to go to school. She first visited Ulpanyali (Kings Canyon) as a teenager and later went to live there. Julie now lives at Ulpanyali Outstation, east of the Ulpanyali sacred site of which she is the custodian. Julie has two children who also live at Ulpanyali. She has never lived around the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area and, as she agreed in cross-examination, does not know the laws or Tjukurrpa for this country.
 
&#8226; Yami Lester. Yami Lester was called as a witness by the Commonwealth but the applicants relied on some of his evidence to support their case. It is fair to say that Mr Lester is a remarkable man. He was born in 1941 at Wallatinna Station in South Australia, in what he described as Yankunytjatjara country. He is now the owner of the station and lives there. Mr Lester's mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman and his stepfather was a Yankunytjatjara man. Mr Lester's stepfather's sister, Munyi, was married to Paddy Uluru. As a child, Mr Lester had no education in the 'white man's way' and he grew up speaking only Yankunytjatjara. His stepfather worked on various stations and the family travelled to those places. People would walk in family groups from one station to another and on these travels Mr Lester heard the Dreaming stories from Paddy Uluru. At the age of 16 Mr Lester became blind, a condition he attributes to radiation from the atomic tests at Maralinga in the early 1950s. He then went to Adelaide for about 14 years, where he lost touch with his people. While in Adelaide he learned English and he returned to central Australia to act as a translator for Western Desert languages. He also received training in welfare and social work. Mr Lester was involved in the establishment of the Central Land Council and of the Institute for Aboriginal Development. He also participated in the work of ARAC in the mid-1970s. At the time he gave evidence Mr Lester, among other positions held by him, was the Chairperson of the Yankunytjatjara Council and a Board Member of the South Australia Aboriginal Housing Authority. Mr Lester's country is his birthplace, Wallatinna, and Iltur (Coffin Hill) through his mother's side. He does not claim that the area around Uluru-Kata Tjurta is his country.

276 Dr Willis is a Senior Research Fellow in Sex, Health and Society at the Australian Research Centre, La Trobe University, Victoria. Although born of European-Australian parents in New South Wales, for most of his adult life Dr Willis has worked for and with Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people. He speaks both dialects. In 1991, Dr Willis became a Pitjantjatjara man through an initiation ceremony which took place at Docker River. Since becoming a wati , he identifies himself as a Pitjantjatjara/Yankunytjatjara man and as an Arnangu .

277 In 1997, Dr Willis completed studies towards the award of a Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Queensland. His thesis examined the social construction of Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara masculinity and sexuality through Walpurku inma and the Tjilkatja cycle of ceremonies. For several years, Dr Willis worked with the Pitjantjatjara Council as an anthropologist. In that capacity, he assisted at the Handback in 1985, where he first met a number of the claimants. He also participated in site clearances, including one for a gravel quarry at Impumpu, some forty kilometres west of Kata Tjurta. From 1989 to 1997, Dr Willis worked with some of the indigenous witnesses as a Community/Park Liaison Officer at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. His primary role was to assist the traditional landowners of the National Park to carry out their responsibilities as co-managers of the Park with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (now Parks Australia).

278 Dr Willis has learned Arnangu laws and customs in general, and the laws and customs of the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area in particular, in 'a similar way to most other Arnangu men'. He has learned the laws and customs of the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area from a series of knowledgeable men, including Reggie and Cassidy Uluru, Johnny Jango, Windlass Aluritja, Malya Teamay, Nipper Winmati and Yami Lester. Dr Willis has also acquired information from women who occupy the position of 'mother' to him, including Nellie Patterson, Nellie Armunta and Rita Jango, as well as from women who occupy the position of 'sister' and 'grandmother', such as Barbara Tjikartu. Dr Willis emphasised that he has learned different classes of information from different groups of Arnangu .

280 A number of points should be made about Dr Willis' evidence:
 
&#8226; First, there was no attack on Dr Willis' credit. I accept him as a witness of truth. I also accept that, generally speaking, his statement constitutes a careful description of events and conduct that he has observed over many years, as well as his observations on other matters within his own knowledge.
 
&#8226; Secondly, Dr Willis' evidence is very useful on the issues with which he deals because of his unique perspective as an observer of and an adherent to the laws and customs of the Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara people of the eastern Western Desert. It is hardly surprising that most indigenous witnesses, particularly if they must speak through an interpreter, experience difficulty in explaining or describing the content of their traditional laws and customs in the alien environment of a courtroom (even if the proceedings are relatively informal). This in no way denigrates the importance or cogency of their evidence, but merely reflects the fact that there are cultural and conceptual barriers to effective communication between indigenous and non-indigenous people on sensitive issues. Dr Willis' training and research experience, coupled with his own experiences as a wati , equip him to convey the concepts embodied in traditional laws and customs in a manner that, to some extent at least, overcomes the communication barriers that otherwise exist.
 
&#8226; Thirdly, despite the length of his statement, Dr Willis' evidence was limited in important respects. He explained in detail such matters as the concept of Tjukurrpa; the significance of ceremonies and rituals to Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people; behavioural rules and prohibitions; belief systems, such as the belief that human bodies are the transformation of the kurunitja (spirit or essence) of Tjukuritja (ancestral beings); ceremonial transformations reflecting those beliefs; initiation rituals; and restrictions on information. However, because the applicants did not press sections of Dr Willis' statement in the face of objections, or perhaps for other reasons, his evidence paid little attention to the laws and customs governing the acquisition and recognition of rights and interests in land. Accordingly, his evidence was largely peripheral to one of the critical issues in the case, namely whether the laws and customs relied on by the applicants can be regarded as 'traditional' in the sense required by s 223(1) of the NTA. 
 
&#8226; Fourthly, Dr Willis' evidence does not always fully support the case presented by the applicants. Indeed, in some respects, as the respondents contend, his evidence is difficult to reconcile with the applicants' contentions.
 
&#8226; Fifthly, any judicial observations made in relation to Dr Willis' evidence in other cases are quite irrelevant to the current proceedings: cf De Rose (FCA) , at [22], [332]-[346], per O'Loughlin J.
 
&#8226; Sixthly, I reject the Commonwealth's submission that the applicants' decision not to call Dr Willis as an expert witness gives rise to an inference that his expert testimony would not have assisted their case. However, Dr Willis is an initiated man who is both knowledgeable about the laws and customs of the Western Desert and able to articulate his views clearly. In these circumstances, the fact that his otherwise detailed evidence does not explain in any depth his understanding of the laws and customs of the Western Desert relating to rights and interests in land is a significant omission in the applicants' case.

281 The applicants tendered statements from three non-indigenous lay witnesses (other than Dr Willis). Only one, Derek Roff, gave oral evidence. Mr Roff took up a position in 1968 as Curator of what was then the Ayres Rock - Mount Olga National Park. He remained in the area until 1985 and in the mid-1970s attended meetings of ARAC. The applicants submit that Mr Roff's evidence confirms 'much of the general picture of the lives and ways of the claimants as given in their evidence'. The Commonwealth, by contrast, contends that Mr Roff's evidence does 'not greatly advance the applicants' case' and indeed supports the Commonwealth's submissions as to the efficacy of the site clearance conducted in respect of the Yulara town site in 1974.

282 Paul Josif provided a statement which was admitted without objection and without Mr Josif being required for cross-examination. Mr Josif was the Joint Management Co-ordinator of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park from 1997 until 2001. However, his evidence is of peripheral significance to this case.

283 The statement of Rev William Edwards was also admitted into evidence without Rev Edwards being required for cross-examination. Reverend Edwards worked as a missionary at Ernabella from 1958 to 1972. He has a Masters degree in anthropology from the University of Adelaide and has lectured in Aboriginal Studies. Reverend Edwards appended to his statement his article, Patterns of Aboriginal Residence, to which I have previously referred (see par 134, above). The applicants make no reference in their submissions in chief to this article. However, the Commonwealth submits that Rev Edwards' description of traditional land ownership and patterns of Aboriginal migration is more consistent with the views of anthropologists such as Tindale, Berndt and Munn than with those of Professor Sutton.

284 The applicants base many of their submissions on the expert report of Professor Peter Sutton, an anthropologist who has impressive qualifications. They also rely, although to a lesser extent, on a report by Ms Petronella Vaarzon-Morel, a consultant anthropologist. I refer to their evidence, particularly that of Professor Sutton, in section 15 , below.

357 Professor Sutton undertook a detailed analysis of a variety of materials in order to demonstrate that there has not been any 'long term full hiatus' in people's connection with the study area. The source material includes, but is by no means limited to, information provided to Professor Sutton or Ms Vaarzon-Morel by the Aboriginal people they interviewed. However, the information cited by Professor Sutton is often supported by the direct evidence of Aboriginal witnesses. None of that evidence was seriously challenged. The direct evidence includes the following:
 
&#8226; evidence that Tjamiwa (a relatively recently deceased man who gave instruction in Arnangu ways, among others, to Dr Willis) was a Mala man born at Ulkiya on the Mala track, south of Uluru; that Tjamiwa made his first visit to the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area before any development had taken place; that he stayed in the area for many years; that he was extremely knowledgeable about the laws and customs of the area; and that he was regarded by Dr Willis and Yami Lester (among others) as a very important man for Uluru;
 
&#8226; evidence that Paddy Uluru was widely regarded as having authority over the Tjukurrpa stories for the area; that Yami Lester was told the stories by Paddy when he (Yami Lester) was a child; that Mr Lester knew that Paddy was the 'number one man' for Uluru; that Paddy lived at Uluru until he left because of a shooting incident in the 1930s; that thereafter he would come and go to and from the area; that Paddy showed Mr Lester in 1971 all the important places around Uluru and that he (Paddy) was recognised by the other Aboriginal men as the main owner; that Paddy was a source of knowledge and instruction for traditional laws and customs; and that he ultimately returned to the area and was buried at Mutitjulu in 1979;
 
&#8226; Armunta's evidence that her father, Charlie Aluritja, was born and grew up at Mantarurr; that she grew up in that area in the traditional way; that when she was a child she and her family walked around Kata Tjurta and Uluru gathering food in the traditional way; that her Dreamings are Kungka Kutjarra, Seven Sisters and Mala; that she was taught the Tjukurrpa by her father and his mother; and that throughout her life she has learned of and adopted traditional practices;
 
&#8226; Ngoi Ngoi Donald's evidence that her father, Lively No 1, was born near Mutitjulu and grew up in the area; that as a child in the 1950s she travelled by camel with her family to Uluru for holidays; that she lived at Ampiyarra and Mutitjulu for a long time after the Handback; that Ngoi Ngoi learned of the Tjukurrpa around Uluru from her grandmother (Tjintjiwara) and her father; that she participated in the Kuniya inma as a child; that she holds the Kuniya Tjukurrpa ; and that she has followed traditional practices relating to gathering of food, the use of bush medicines and 'sorry business';
 
&#8226; Reggie Uluru's account of travelling with his family to Uluru in the 1940s, before he became a wati; that he is an initiated man and had become wati tjirlpi (a senior initiated man); that he returned to Uluru to look after the area, see what his father taught him and to oversee the whole area; that he lived and worked at Uluru for a long time; that he is knowledgeable about and follows traditional Arnangu law relating, for example, to hunting, food-gathering, traditional implements and sorry business; that he has both the Mala and Kuniya Tjukurrpa derived from his father, mother and grandfather; and that he knows the Tjukurrpa and the sites for the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area;
 
&#8226; Barbara Tjikartu's evidence that she walked with her family around the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area as a child; that she worked at Uluru from Bill Harney's time; that her husband (Nipper Winmati) grew up at Uluru which was his country and his father's country; and that she is ninti (knowledgeable) about the Tjukurrpa for Uluru and has taught her children about the Tjukurrpa ;
 
&#8226; Yami Lester's evidence that when he first went to Uluru in 1971 he met Aboriginal people living there; and that those people included Captain No 1 and his wife Mary and daughter Tiku, Captain No 2 (Captain No 1's brother), Nui Minyintiri (who was Frank Djana's father and had been at Uluru in 1968 when Derek Roff arrived) and Toby (apparently Windlass Aluritja's brother) and his wife Ada; and 
 
&#8226; Windlass Aluritja's evidence that he took his country at Kata Tjurta from his father, Yaluritja; that as a child he walked through the Uluru-Kata Tjurta area with his family and camped at a number of places; that he worked and lived at Uluru for some time; that he was an initiated man; that he learned about his country and the Tjukurrpa from his father (and others) after he was initiated; that his Dreaming is the Honey Ant which travels from his birthplace through Mantarurr and Mutitjulu; and that he knows all the traditional ways and as a senior initiated man teaches his children and the younger people.

358 The evidence to which I have referred suggests that, notwithstanding periods of interruption, a small number of Aboriginal people maintained a physical association with the country around Uluru-Kata Tjurta from the 1930s. It also suggests that in the five decades leading to the Handback some of these people acknowledged and observed important elements of the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert.

359 This conclusion is reinforced by the evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses as to how they learned of the Tjukurrpa stories and other aspects of traditional laws and customs. Thus Windlass Aluritja said this about the stories relating to calling out for the Warnampi (Water Serpent) at Mantarurr:
 
 'THE INTERPRETER: Right. Yes, my grandfather, his grandfather and his grandfather all told me the story, my tjamu. 
 
 
 WINDLASS KUNMARNARRA: Uwa. 
 
 MR PARSONS: And that story keep [sic] going? 
 
 WINDLASS KUNMARNARRA: [Aboriginal language spoken] 
 
 
 THE INTERPRETER: Yes, those stories here forever now, continue forever, and the water stays, you saw the water there; that water will be there forever. 
 
 MR PARSONS: And your own kids, do you tell that story, pass that story on? 
 
 WINDLASS KUNMARNARRA: [Aboriginal language spoken] 
 
 THE INTERPRETER: Yes, my father told me to say the same story, pass it down, the same story, same story line; I change nothing, the same story.'

404 The applicants then refer to evidence supporting the particular criteria identified in Proposition 7 in the Sutton Report. In summary, their contentions are as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; Borning place. The applicants cite numerous examples of witnesses stating that they, or a relative (usually a parent or grandparent), had become ngurraritja for country by virtue of being born there, although the witnesses sometimes also relied on other factors such as being put through the smoke at that place.
 &#8226; Borning place nearby on Dreaming track. The applicants support this criterion by reference to the evidence of several witnesses who suggested, in various ways, that they (or others) had become ngurraritja for country by virtue of their association with a Tjukurrpa track. For example, Dora Walkabout claimed to be ngurraritja for Mantarurr and Uluru, among other places, because she was born at Urrampinyi (Tempe Downs Station) on the Kungka Kutjarra (Two Women) track. (Urrampinyi is some 200 kilometres from Uluru.) Johnny Jango claimed to be associated with Uluru by reason, among other factors, of his birth at Maratjurra (about 150 kilometres from Uluru) on the Kuniya Tjukurrpa track. Malya Teamay, who claimed to be ngurraritja for several different areas, said that his country included Uluru through the Kuniya (Python) , Mala (Rufous hare wallaby) , Lirru (Brown Snake) and Kurrpany (Devil Dog) Tjukurrpa tracks.
 &#8226; Kin links. The applicants cite evidence, for example from Frank Djana, Barbara Tjikartu and Windlass Aluritja, that a person can take the country of his or her father or grandfather. However, they also refer to evidence from other witnesses, including Bessie Liddle, that country may be taken through a mother or grandfather or indeed other relatives. This evidence, so the applicants submit, shows that there is not and never has been a 'strictly patrilineal system of acquiring rights in country'. The applicants rely on Donald Fraser's evidence for the proposition that there are factors limiting the extension of country through kin links. The only two factors identified are the need for an 'important Dreaming' and 'choice'. 
 &#8226; Generation or time depth of identification with the area. The only evidence to which the applicants refer on this point is that of Donald Fraser. However, the evidence merely consists of a remark that a person's country is where his or her family has lived for hundreds of years. 
 &#8226; Linguistic identification. The applicants point to evidence from Frank Djana, Judy Trigger and others suggesting that the area around Uluru and Kata Tjurta is Yankunytjatjara country. Oddly enough, however, it is only in their reply that the applicants address the difficulty that some of the people within the compensation claim group appear not to be Yankunytjatjara people, but people whose first language is Pitjantjatjara or, in some instances, another language of the Western Desert.
 &#8226; Religious and ritual knowledge. The applicants cite the evidence of Peter Wilson (a wati , but a relatively junior man) as support for the contention that ritual knowledge is more concerned with status among rights holders than an independent basis for holding rights. However, they acknowledge that some witnesses (Rita Jango, Pantjitji McKenzie and Donald Fraser) gave evidence suggesting that knowledge of Tjukurrpa , of itself, confers rights in land.
 &#8226; Long association. The applicants submit that the evidence (principally that of Donald Fraser) shows that a person cannot become ngurraritja for a place only by living there for a very long time. However, it can be a factor in activating a condition or in improving one's position in relation to others. Moreover, so they argue, a person can have a long association with a place without physically residing there.
 &#8226; Taking responsibility. The applicants cite only the evidence of Peter Wilson to support this criterion. They accept that it 'involve[s] extensive overlap with others' since it is difficult to take responsibility without knowledge and it is also difficult to acquire knowledge without long association.
 &#8226; Assertion and support. The applicants state that it is not part of their case that assertion is a sufficient basis for holding rights and interests in land. They say that active assertion of and support for a claim 'may be involved in the activation of an "automatic" factor' and may improve the status of the person making the assertion against other rights holders. The applicants do not suggest that any of the Aboriginal witnesses gave evidence to this effect. They appear to deduce the principle from the fact that most witnesses made assertions about their own rights and interests and those of other people.
 &#8226; Caring for country. The applicants refer to evidence from witnesses to the effect that a person who becomes ngurraritja for country is expected to look after it. None of the passages cited by the applicants, however, suggests that caring for country confers the status of ngurraritja on a person.

405 As the Territory points out, the applicants' written submissions adopt what might be described as a cumulative approach. That is, they support each of the various elements of their pleaded case (or of Proposition 7) by reference to the evidence of one or, perhaps, several witnesses. The assumption appears to be that the particular combination of laws and customs upon which the applicants rely can be pieced together like a mosaic, using selected elements from the evidence of individual witnesses.

406 A major difficulty with this approach is that none of the Aboriginal witnesses gave evidence that the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert relating to rights and interests in land correspond to the case pleaded by the applicants. Indeed the applicants' submissions do not suggest otherwise. It is true that the evidence of the indigenous witnesses, taken overall, provides some support for specific aspects of the pleaded case. In particular, the evidence suggests that having a borning place on or in close proximity to a specific site of itself ordinarily suffices to create rights and interests in that site, although even on this point different views were expressed. But the evidence does not support the dichotomy between 'conditions' (satisfaction of any one of which suffices to create native title rights and interests) and 'additional factors' relied on by the applicants. Nor does it support the combination of criteria pleaded in the Points of Claim or, for that matter, the combination of criteria set out in Professor Sutton's Proposition 7. Perhaps not surprisingly, the evidence of individual witnesses tended to be framed in a way that favoured their own claims or those of close relatives.

715 There is a good deal of common ground among the parties. First , the respondents accept the applicants' contention that the Self-Government Act (an enactment of the Commonwealth Parliament) must be read consistently with the RD Act (an earlier enactment of the Commonwealth Parliament). This concession reflects the principle of construction stated by Gaudron J in Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1, at 17:
 
 'It is a basic rule of construction that, in the absence of express words, an earlier statutory provision is not repealed, altered or derogated from by a later provision unless an intention to that effect is necessarily to be implied. There must be very strong grounds to support that implication, for there is a general presumption that the legislature intended that both provisions should operate and that, to the extent that they would otherwise overlap, one should be read as subject to the other'.

716 Secondly , s 10(1) of the RD Act continues to speak in respect of Territory laws after the Self-Government Act came into force. This is because s 57 of the Self-Government Act excludes from the power of alteration conferred on the Territory any Commonwealth enactment in force immediately before the commencement of the Self-Government Act : Ward (HC) , at [130]-[133].

717 Thirdly , the parties agree that acts done by the Executive of the Territory before the NTA came into force could extinguish native title rights and interests over land. Extinguishment would occur if the acts were validly done pursuant to statutory authority and involved an assertion of powers over the land inconsistent with the continued existence of some or all of the surviving native title rights and interests: Ward (HC) , at [26], [151], [214].</text>

<text>687 Callinan J acknowledged that there were Canadian authorities to the effect that caveats could not be lodged to protect Aboriginal title under the Torrens system. However, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Paulette v The Queen [1977] 2 SCR 628, turned on the fact that the land had never been granted by the Crown and was not the subject of any registered title (see Paulette v The Queen, at 630). The decision therefore said nothing about whether native title rights and interests could be protected by caveat after a Crown grant had issued in respect of the land. His Honour considered that other Canadian decisions turned on the particular provisions of the Torrens statutes in force: see Uukw v British Columbia (1987) 37 DLR (4 th ) 408, followed in Skeetschestn Indian Band v British Columbia (Registrar of Land Titles) [2001] 1 CNLR 310 (both decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1969/28.html</AustLII>
<text>730 The latter proposition is illustrated by Wade v New South Wales Rutile Mining Co Pty Ltd [1969] HCA 28 ; (1969) 121 CLR 177. The High Court held there that the Mining Act 1906 (NSW) should be construed, in the circumstances of the case, not to interfere with a landowner's right to carry on mining operations on his own land. Barwick CJ (at 181) applied
 
 'the fundamental principle that if Parliament intends to derogate from the common law right of the citizen it should make its law in that respect plain ... The courts are not entitled, and ought not, to eke out a derogation of such private rights by implications not rendered necessary by the words used by Parliament but merely considered to be consistent with the policy which the courts conclude or suppose the Parliament intended to implement'. 
 
 
 See, too, at 182 per Menzies J.

731 In the light of this rule of construction, the Self-Government Act and the Self-Government Regulations cannot be interpreted as empowering a Territory Minister to undertake public works on freehold or leasehold land (held by persons other than the Crown or its instrumentalities) without consent and without affording adequate compensation. If a Minister purported to authorise such works to be undertaken, his or her conduct would be inconsistent with the rights of the freeholder or leaseholder and would fall outside the executive powers of the Territory. If works were carried out on the freehold or leasehold land without permission, they could not extinguish or impair the title of the freeholder or leaseholder in the absence of specific legislation making provision to that effect. (Such legislation, if enacted by the Legislative Assembly, might also raise issues of compatibility with s 50(1) of the Self-Government Act .)

732 If this reasoning is correct, the Self-Government Act and the Self-Government Regulations would have the practical operation and effect of discriminating against native title holders. In the absence of s 10(1) of the RD Act , those provisions would authorise Territory Ministers to undertake public works on Crown land, including land in respect of which Aboriginal people hold native title rights and interests. If the works were inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, those rights and interests would be extinguished and no compensation (leaving the NTA to one side) would be payable in respect of the extinguishment. But the Self-Government Act and the Self-Government Regulations , construed in the manner I have explained, would not authorise the Territory Ministers to undertake public works that could extinguish or interfere with other titles, such as freehold or leasehold estates carrying the right to exclusive possession.</text>

<tocase>Western Australia v Commonwealth [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/47.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In Western Australia v Commonwealth [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373 (' Native Title Act Case '), the High Court observed (at 453) that s 11 removes the vulnerability of native title to:
 
 'defeasance at common law by providing a prima facie sterilisation of all acts which would otherwise defeat native title. By that prima facie sterilisation, s 11(1) ensures that the exceptions prescribed by other provisions of the Act which permit the extinguishment or impairment of native title constitute an exclusive code. Conformity with the code is essential to the effective extinguishment or impairment of native title. The Native Title Act thus governs the recognition, protection, extinguishment and impairment of native title.' 
 

However, the Court also said (at 454) that an: 
 
 'act which was wholly valid when it was done and which was effective then to extinguish or impair native title is unaffected by the Native Title Act . Such an act neither needs nor is given force and effect by the Act'. 


 
This comment suggests that s 11(1) is intended to have a prospective effect only, a view supported by the Court's observation (at 468) that the effect of the provision is that: 
 
 ' any future State law which purports to extinguish native title contrary to the Act is inoperative by reason of s 109 of the Constitution ' . (Emphasis added.)

35 The Native Title Act Case was decided before the NTA was extensively amended in 1998. The amendments include the insertion of Div 2B of Part 2 into the legislation, which provides for confirmation of past extinguishment of native title. In its original form, s 11(2) provided that legislation enacted after 1 July 1993 by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, could only extinguish native title in accordance with Div 3 of Part 2 (which deals with future acts) or by validating past acts in relation to native title. Following the 1998 amendments, s 11(2) provides that legislation enacted in accordance with Div 2B of Part 2 of the NTA is one of the permissible means by which native title can be extinguished after 1 July 1993.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/28.html</AustLII>
<text>50 Division 2B of Part 2 of the NTA was inserted by the NTAA 1998 and came into force on 30 September 1998. Division 2B is intended to confirm past extinguishment of native title by certain acts which were valid and which were not struck at by the RD Act : Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 (' Ward (HC) ') at [8]. Such acts include those which predated the RD Act, such as the pastoral leases over the Application Area, and those which have been validated by the NTA (including by the operation of Div 2 of Part 2 and its State and Territory analogues). Division 2B confirms that certain acts attributable to the Commonwealth that were done before 23 December 1996 completely or partially extinguished native title: s 23A(1). The acts having that effect may be: 
 
 
 (a) 'previous exclusive possession acts' (involving, for example, the grant of freehold estates or leases conferring exclusive possession); or 
 (b) 'previous non-exclusive possession acts' (involving, for example, grants of non-exclusive pastoral leases): s 23A(2), (3).

51 Division 2B allows the States and Territories to legislate, in respect of 'previous exclusive possession acts' and 'previous non-exclusive possession acts' attributable to them, for the extinguishment of native title in the same way as is done under Div 2B for acts attributable to the Commonwealth: s 23A(4). The Territory has enacted such legislation: Validation Act , Parts 3B, 3C.

52 Section 23J of the NTA (within Div 2B) provides as follows:
 
 ' Entitlement 
 
 
 (1) The native title holders are entitled to compensation in accordance with Division 5 for any extinguishment under this Division of their native title rights and interests by an act, but only to the extent (if any) that the native title rights and interests were not extinguished otherwise than under this Act. 
 
 Commonwealth acts 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) If the act is attributable to the Commonwealth, the compensation is payable by the Commonwealth. 
 
 State and Territory acts 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) If the act is attributable to a State or Territory, the compensation is payable by the State or Territory.' (Emphasis added.)</text>

<tocase>Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/40.html</AustLII>
<text>550 Sections 9L and 9M of the Validation Act correspond to s 23G of the NTA . Section 23G was introduced by the NTAA 1998 , but was amended in the course of its passage through Parliament. The Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (No 2) ('Supplementary EM') , circulated with the authority of the Prime Minister, explained the provision as follows:
 
 'Paragraph 23G(1)(a) in the [existing] Bill provides that native title is partially extinguished by a previous non-exclusive possession act attributable to the Commonwealth. This reflects the Government's view that at common law the grant of an interest by the Crown extinguishes any native title the continuance of which is inconsistent with the grant: see Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1 at 243. That is, native title is extinguished to the extent of any inconsistency with the Crown grant. Of course, it is for a court to determine to what extent native title rights and interests are inconsistent with the grant. 
 
 This is still the Government's understanding of the common law. There is however an opposing view of the common law. That view is that the grant of a non-exclusive possession title, such as a non-exclusive pastoral lease of the kind involved in Wik, does not extinguish native title rights and interest [sic] that are inconsistent with the grant; rather, the inconsistent native title rights are merely suspended while the non-exclusive possession title is in force. This is not the Government's understanding of the common law. 
 
 However, the Government has agreed to leave this issue to be finally determined by the common law. 
 
 Paragraph 23G(1)(b) confirms that the grant of a non-exclusive possession agricultural or non-exclusive possession pastoral lease will extinguish any native title rights and interests that are inconsistent with the grant if that is the position at common law. If however the position at common law is that a non-exclusive possession agricultural lease or non-exclusive possession pastoral lease does not extinguish any inconsistent native title rights and interests, but merely suspends them while the lease is in existence, then subparagraph 23G(1)(b)(ii) ensures that the inconsistent native rights and interests are suspended for the duration of the lease (including as renewed etc).'

551 Section 23G(1)(b) of the NTA gives effect to the Government's intention. It applies to the extent that a previous non-exclusive possession act (in this case, the pastoral lease) involves the grant of rights and interests that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. If, apart from the NTA, the act extinguishes native title rights and interests, those interests are extinguished (s 23G(1)(b)(i)). However, if the act, apart from the NTA , does not extinguish native title rights and interests, those rights and interests are nonetheless suspended for the duration of the lease (s 23G(1)(b)(ii)). Section 9M(1)(a) of the Validation Act corresponds to s 23G(1)(b)(i) of the NTA, while s 9M(1)(b) corresponds to s 23G(1)(b)(ii).

552 Insofar as the applicants contend that they have native title rights to control access to the land and the use and enjoyment of the land, and that those rights survived the grant of the pastoral leases, they must confront the reasoning adopted in Ward (HC) . The starting point for present purposes is the determination made by the Full Federal Court in that case (reproduced in Ward (HC) , at [47]). The determination declared (par 5) that the native title rights and interests over a part of the determination area included:
 
 '(a) a right to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the land; [and]
 
 (b) a right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the land'. 
 

The rights and interests were said (par 9) to be 'not exclusive of the rights and interests of others'.

553 The joint judgment in Ward (HC) noted (at [49)] that there was a tension between pars 5(b) and 9 of the determination. Their Honours said that:
 
 '[i]dentifying the content of a right to make decisions about use and enjoyment of land that is not exclusive of the rights of others in that regard is not easy. Providing that, to the extent that any inconsistency exists, native title rights and interests must yield to the rights of others does not help in identifying the content of a non-exclusive right to make decisions about use and enjoyment.' 
 

Their Honours also pointed out (at [52]) that without a right as against the whole world to possession of land:
 
 'it may greatly be doubted that there is any right to control access to land or make binding decisions about the use to which it is put'.

554 In considering whether the rights granted by the Western Australian pastoral leases were inconsistent with claimed native title rights and interests, the joint judgment in Ward (HC) reached the following conclusions (at [192], [194], [422]):
 
 'These [pastoral leases] were acts involving the grant of rights and interests inconsistent with so much of the native title rights and interests as stipulated for control of access to the land the subject of the grants. The pastoral leases were acts attributable to the State which denied to the native title holders the continuation of a traditional right to say who could or who could not come onto the land in question. That consequence flowed apart from the provisions of the State Validation Act. It followed that to that extent the grants of pastoral leases extinguished native title rights and interests within the meaning of par (b)(i) of s 12M(1) [the equivalent to the Validation Act, s 9M(1)(a)].
 
 ...
 
 The right to control access apart, many other native title rights to use the land the subject of the pastoral leases probably continued unaffected. For example, the native title right to hunt or gather traditional food on the land would not be inconsistent with the rights of the pastoral leaseholder although, as stated in par (a) of s 12M(1) [the equivalent to the Validation Act, s 9L], the rights of the pastoral leaseholder would "prevail over" the native title rights and interests in question. On the other hand, for the native title holders to burn off the land probably would have been inconsistent with the rights granted to the pastoral leaseholder, so as to bring about extinguishment as identified in par (b)(i) of s 12M(1). 
 
 ...
 
 The right to be asked permission to use or have access to the land was inconsistent with the rights asserted under the various pastoral leases. Therefore, independently of any operation of the Territory Validation Act, the consecutive pre-RDA grants of the pastoral leases extinguished this native title right. Paragraph (a) of s 9M(1) of the Territory Validation Act thus was attracted and the relevant native title right extinguished.'

555 These conclusions accord with the approach taken in the Yarmirr (HC) . In that case, it was held that there was a 'fundamental inconsistency' between the asserted native title right to exclude all others from the waters of the claim area, on the one hand, and the common law public rights of navigation and fishing, on the other (at [98]). An assertion of sovereignty which conceded the public rights was:
 
 'not consistent with the continuation of a right in the holders of a native title right to the area for those holders to say who may enter the area' (at [99]).
 

The inconsistency lay not merely in the competing claims to control entry to the claim area, but in the expression of that control:
 
 'by the sovereign authority in a way that is antithetical to the continued existence of the asserted exclusive rights' (at [100]).

556 The inquiry must commence with the question of fact posed by the NTA: 
 
 'what are the rights and interests in relation to land or waters which are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples?' 
 

 Yarmirr (HC) , at [15]; Ward (HC), at [94]. The rights and interests are those capable of being possessed under traditional laws and customs and need not correspond with common law conceptions of property: Yorta Yorta (HC) , at [40]. Such rights and interests owe their origins to a normative system other than the legal system of the new sovereign power (the Crown). That is, native title rights and interests owe their origins to the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the relevant indigenous peoples: Yorta Yorta (HC) , at [37].

557 It is therefore a mistake to assume that native title rights and interests are to be expressed in common law terms. For example, it is productive of error to speak of native title rights and interests in terms of 'possession'. As was said in Ward (HC) , at [89]:
 
 'to speak of "possession" of the land, as distinct from possession to the exclusion of all others, invites attention to the common law content of the concept of possession and whatever notions of control over access might be thought attached to it, rather than to the relevant task, which is to identify how rights and interests possessed under traditional law and custom can properly find expression in common law terms'.

558 Although the right to be asked for permission to enter or use the land and to speak for country is a core concept in traditional laws and custom, it is not an exhaustive description of the rights and interests in relation to land that exists under those laws and customs:
 
 'It is wrong to see Aboriginal connection with land as reflected only in concepts of control of access to it. To speak of Aboriginal connection with "country" in only those terms is to reduce a very complex relationship to a single dimension. It is to impose common law concepts of property on peoples and systems which saw the relationship between the community and the land very differently from the common lawyer'. 


 Ward (HC) , at [90].

559 Curiously enough, it is this core concept of a right to be asked permission and to speak for country that made native title 'inherently fragile' before the enactment of the NTA. As was said in Ward (HC) , at [91]:
 
 'The assertion of sovereignty marked the imposition of a new source of authority over the land. Upon that authority being exercised, by the creation or assertion of rights to control access to land, the right to be asked for permission to use or have access to the land was inevitably confined, if not excluded. But because native title is more than the right to be asked for permission to use or have access (important though that right undoubtedly is) there are other rights and interests which must be considered, including rights and interests in the use of the land'. 
 

The joint judgment also observed (at [94]) that there is particular scope for error:
 
 'if a portmanteau expression used to translate those rights and interests ("possession, occupation, use and enjoyment ... to the exclusion of all others") is severed into its constituent parts and those parts are then treated as they would be in the description of some common law title to land.' 
 

It is doubtless for this reason that the applicants do not contend that their pleaded right against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the claim area is consistent with the rights granted by the pastoral leases.

754 In Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1 (' Wik '), a majority of the High Court held that certain pastoral leases in Queensland did not confer a right to exclusive possession on the lessees and thus did not necessarily extinguish all incidents of native title. The decision in Wik was thought by many to be inconsistent with the assumptions underlying the NTA . In particular, the recitals to the NTA recorded that the High Court in Mabo (No 2) had:
 
 'held that native title is extinguished by valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates '. (Emphasis added.)

755 On 8 May 1997 the Government announced a '10 Point Plan' as its response to Wik . The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (' NTA Bill 1997' ), which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 4 September 1997, was designed to implement the 10 Point Plan.

756 The NTA Bill 1997 was passed by the House of Representatives on 29 October 1997. The Senate subsequently passed the Bill but amended it extensively. The Bill was reintroduced into the House on 9 March 1998. Many of the Senate's amendments were accepted by the House of Representatives and the NTA Bill 1997 was amended to incorporate these changes. It was this version of the NTA Bill 1997 to which the 1997 Explanatory Memorandum was directed.

759 The 1997 Explanatory Memorandum noted that Div 2B confirmed the effect on native title of various types of Commonwealth acts done before 23 December 1996 and that the legislation attempted to reflect the Government's understanding of the common law of native title after Wik (par 5.1). It also noted that Div 2B permitted the States and Territories to confirm the effect of acts they had done prior to 23 December 1996. The 1997 Explanatory Memorandum continued as follows:
 
 
 '5.2 Generally speaking, the existing NTA only provides a framework for dealing with native title. The NTA currently says little about whether or where native title may still exist in Australia, and apart from the very limited validation provisions in Division 2 of Part 2 , says nothing about whether native title may or may not have been extinguished. The NTA generally leaves these issues to be determined by the common law. This has given rise to significant uncertainty for native title claimants and the holders of other interests in land. 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.3 The purpose of the proposed amendments dealing with confirmation of extinguishment of native title is to limit this uncertainty. The effect will be to confirm that the native title is extinguished on exclusive tenures (such as freehold and residential leases) and extinguished to the extent of any inconsistency on non-exclusive agricultural and pastoral leases. Consistent with the Wik decision, the rationale for such confirmation is that the rights conferred and/or the nature of the use of the land is such that the exclusion of others (including native title holders) must have been presumed when the tenure was granted. The amendments will put the matter beyond doubt.'

760 Paragraph 5.28 of the 1997 Explanatory Memorandum addressed the effect of confirmation of extinguishment on the provisions dealing with past acts, as follows:
 
 'If native title has been extinguished by a previous exclusive possession act or a previous non-exclusive possession act, the provisions that deal with the effects of past acts... on native title do not apply [subsections 23C(3) and 23G(3) ... ] . These provisions [included] existing section 15 of the NTA ... Subsections 23C(3) and 23G(3) ensure that there is no overlap between the provisions that extinguish native title. For example, the non-extinguishment principle applies to the grant by the Commonwealth of freehold validated under Division 2 if it was no longer in existence on 1 January 1994 (see subsection 229(2) and section 232) but by reason of s 23C(1) , the native title will now be taken to have been extinguished by that grant.' (Emphasis in original.)

761 The example given in the last sentence of par 5.28 refers to s 15(1)(d) of the NTA , which provides that the non-extinguishment principle applies to a category D past act. A category D past act includes the grant of a freehold estate, where the grant was made before 1 January 1994 but the estate did not exist on 1 January 1994: s 229(2)(a) , (4). Section 23C(1) provides that a previous exclusive possession act (which includes the grant of a freehold estate validated under Div 2) extinguishes native title and does so from the date the act was done. As par 5.28 implies, the effect of s 23C(3) is to exclude s 15 of the NTA from applying to the previous exclusive possession act notwithstanding that it was also a past act. Thus the non-extinguishment principle does not apply to the category D past act.</text>

<text>36 In any claim for determination of native title, or for compensation for loss or impairment of native title rights and interests, the NTA is 'determinative': Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (' Yorta Yorta (HC) ') , at [32], [70]. Accordingly, even if native title was extinguished under common law rules which are taken to have applied prior to the commencement of the NTA , it is still necessary to consider the application of the statute (and its State and Territory counterparts) to any act said to have extinguished native title: Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29 ; (2002) 213 CLR 401 , at [45]-[47], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

53 In Wilson v Anderson , Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed (at [51]) that s 23J(1) of the NTA :
 
 'has the effect of conferring upon native title holders an entitlement to compensation only where the statutory extinguishment exceeds the extinguishment that would have occurred at common law. The evident purpose of s 23J is to limit, so far as possible, the entitlement to compensation under s 23J, to cases where the "act" is invalid by reason of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ... and is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or s 8 of the State Act [equivalent to s 4 of the Validation Act ]. However, s 23J also may be attracted in respect of a valid "act" which, although satisfying the definition of "previous exclusive possession act", would not completely extinguish native title at common law. That a different result may be reached under Div 2B of Pt 2 of the NTA or Pt 4 of the State Act [equivalent to Parts 3B and 3C of the Validation Act ] emphasises the point that it is the statutory criteria provided for by those provisions which are to be applied when determining issues of extinguishment.' (Emphasis added.)

54 Section 10(1) of the RD Act (the terms of which are reproduced at par 102, below) may operate to confer a right to compensation upon native title holders where a State or Territory law has failed to make the right universal by denying it to the native title holders. For example in Ward (HC) , the High Court held (at [253]) that s 10(1) of the RD Act conferred a right to compensation on native title holders for the loss of their rights by the creation of a reserve pursuant to a State statute. The RD Act conferred a right to compensation because under State law the only interests that were destroyed without compensation by the creation of the reserve were those of the native title holders. In such circumstances, the creation of the reserve was valid and could not be a 'past act' validated by legislation corresponding to Div 2 of Part 2 of the NTA . The effect of s 10(1) of the RD Act , however, was that the native title holders were entitled to compensation.

55 Section 45 of the NTA is concerned with a right to compensation which arises in such circumstances. It provides as follows:
 
 
 '(1) If the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 has the effect that compensation is payable to native title holders in respect of an act that validly affects native title to any extent, the compensation, in so far as it relates to the effect on native title, is to be determined in accordance with section 50 as if the entitlement arose under this Act. 
 
 
 
 Recovery of compensation 
 
 
 
 (2) If the act took place before 1 January 1994 and is attributable to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the native title holders may recover the compensation from the Commonwealth, the State or the Territory, as the case requires.'

560 A number of other propositions were endorsed in Ward (HC). They were recently summarised in De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose (FC) (No 2) '), at [145], as follows: (the references are to paragraphs in Ward (HC) ).
 
 
 
 
 '(i) Native title rights and interests are properly to be seen as a bundle of rights, the separate components of which can be extinguished separately (at [76]-[77]). 
 
 (ii) Where a grant of rights in land is made pursuant to statute, the question (so far as extinguishment is concerned) is whether the rights are inconsistent with native title rights and interests in respect of the land [(at [214])]. This is an objective inquiry which requires identification of and a comparison between two sets of rights, one deriving from traditional laws and customs and the other from 'the new sovereign authority that came with settlement' (at [78], [82]). Reference to the use of land is relevant only to the extent that it focuses attention upon the rights pursuant to which the land is used (at [78]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) Rights held under an interest in land less than a fee simple estate, such as a lease, can be inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests and therefore can extinguish them (at [80]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) There is no such thing as degrees of inconsistency of rights: 
 
 
 
 "Two rights are inconsistent or they are not. If they are inconsistent, there will be extinguishment to the extent of the inconsistency ... Absent particular statutory provision to the contrary, questions of suspension of one set of rights in favour of another do not arise " ( at [82]). (Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 (v) Section 23G(1)(b)(i) of the NTA contemplates that a previous non-exclusive possession act, such as a pre- RD Act pastoral lease, may grant rights and interests that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests and extinguish the latter (at [192]; see, too, Wilson v Anderson, at [46]). Where that occurs, no question of suspension of native title arises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) Section 23G(1)(b)(ii) of the NTA addresses the case where there is an inconsistent grant of rights which, apart from the NTA and its State [or Territory] counterpart, would not extinguish native title rights and interests. The example given is a post-1975 grant which, by operation of the RD Act , was ineffective to extinguish native title rights and interests (at [82]). (This seems to involve reading the expression "the grant of rights" in s 23G(1)(b) as including a purported grant, given that the RD Act would, apart from the NTA , presumably render the grant invalid.)' 
 

To these six propositions derived from Ward (HC) two others can usefully be added:
 
 
 (vii) Reference to the use of land in the context of extinguishment may distract attention from the true inquiry, namely whether rights have been created in third parties that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. Use of land may suggest, or even demonstrate, that such rights have been created, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not use (at [215]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 (viii) The metaphor of a 'bundle of rights' is useful in two respects: 
 
 
 'It draws attention first to the fact that there may be more than one right or interest and secondly to the fact that there may be several kinds of rights and interests in relation to land that exist under traditional law and custom' (at [95]). (Emphasis added.)

769 This view receives support from the observations concerning s 23J made by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wilson v Anderson . Their Honours said this (at [51]):
 
 'Sub-section (1) of s 23J has the effect of conferring upon native title holders an entitlement to compensation only where the statutory extinguishment exceeds the extinguishment that would have occurred at common law. The evident purpose s 23J is to limit, so far as possible, the entitlement to compensation under s 23J , to cases where the "act" is invalid by reason of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ... and is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or [equivalent State or Territory legislation] . However, s 23J also may be attracted in respect of a valid "act" which, although satisfying the definition of "previous exclusive possession act", would not completely extinguish native title at common law. That a different result may be reached under Div 2B of Pt 2 of the NTA or Pt 4 of the State Act emphasises the point that it is the statutory criteria provided for by those provisions which are to applied when determining issues of extinguishment'. 
 

Their Honours' observations proceed on the basis that s 23J of the NTA creates an entitlement to compensation in cases where an act is invalid by reason of the RD Act but is subsequently validated by s 14 of the NTA or a State or Territory counterpart. Such an act presumably would be a 'past act' as defined in s 228(2) of the NTA as well as a 'previous exclusive possession act' as defined in s 23B of the NTA.

770 This construction of Div 2B of the NTA does not leave Div 2 without any work to do. Not all past acts are previous exclusive possession acts for the purposes of Div 2B of the NTA. For example, the grant of an estate is not a previous exclusive possession act if the grant involves the establishment of a national park for the purpose of preserving the natural environment: s 23B(9A). Yet such a grant may vest a right of exclusive possession in the grantee which is capable of extinguishing native title rights and interests: Ward (HC) , at [258]. If the grant was invalid under the RD Act by reason of its effect on native title, it could be a past act (s 228(2)) and could be validated by s 14 of the NTA. The effect on native title of the grant would be determined by s 15 of the NTA and the entitlement to compensation would arise under s 17.

771 As Mr Hughston pointed out, this construction of Div 2B accords with what will often be the practical realities and avoids what otherwise would be strange consequences. Previous exclusive possession acts include grants of fee simple estates or leases and the construction of public works. Some of these acts may have been invalid when done by reason of the RD Act (and thus would have been 'past acts'), but this would not have been known at the time. The practical consequences of these acts usually would have included the de facto loss or impairment of native title rights and interests. It makes sense that any right to compensation in respect of the validation of those acts is to be determined as at the date the acts took place.</text>

<tocase>Yarmirr v Northern Territory (1998) 82 FCR 533</tocase>
<text>288 The Commonwealth also accepts that the evidence of the Aboriginal witnesses provides the most important evidence in a native title case. It points out that trial Judges dealing with native title claims in this Court have consistently stated that what really matters in such cases is the evidence of the Aboriginal claimants: Yarmirr v Northern Territory (1998) 82 FCR 533 (' Yarmirr' ), at 562, per Olney J; De Rose(FCA) , at [342], [351], per O'Loughlin J.

289 The Commonwealth submits that there are inconsistencies between the evidence of Aboriginal witnesses and the expert evidence given by Professor Sutton and Ms Vaarzon- Morel. Both experts describe the information provided to them by Aboriginal people (many of whom were witnesses in the proceedings) as 'folk models' that can be at odds with the actual behaviour of people. In the words of Professor Sutton:
 
 'The old rules persist in the minds of older people and may be stated in a simple or conservative form that does not describe at all richly the various solutions younger people have been reaching in practice.'

290 The Commonwealth further submits that expert anthropological evidence, even if unchallenged, cannot overcome significant gaps in the evidence given by indigenous witnesses. Thus in Yarmirr at first instance, Olney J declined to accept a claim that the Aboriginal applicants, by their traditional laws and customs, enjoyed exclusive possession, occupation and enjoyment of the waters of the claimed area, notwithstanding that the claim had been supported by the virtually unchallenged anthropological evidence: Yarmirr , at 563, 585. In the light of these authorities, the Commonwealth submits that the evidence of Professor Sutton and Ms Vaarzon-Morel cannot be used to rectify deficiencies in the evidence of the Aboriginal witnesses.

291 It is plainly correct that expert anthropological evidence is unlikely to cure certain kinds of gaps or deficiencies in evidence adduced from Aboriginal witnesses. If, for example, indigenous witnesses consistently disclaim a suggestion that their traditional laws and customs allow interests in country to be acquired in a particular manner, evidence to the contrary by an anthropologist is unlikely to carry a great deal of weight. This will be so even if the anthropologist's evidence is not directly challenged in cross-examination, since evidence from indigenous witnesses is normally regarded as providing the most reliable account of traditional laws and customs of the relevant people.

292 Depending upon the circumstances, however, anthropological evidence might well supplement the testimony of indigenous witnesses and, in that sense, fill in some evidentiary gaps. In the present case, for example, the applicants submit, with some force, that most of the Aboriginal witnesses experienced difficulty in providing full and coherent accounts of their customary practices in relation to country. This was by no means because they lacked knowledge or understanding of those practices. Rather, it reflected the fact that they were not accustomed to expressing the underlying concepts in a manner suited to a courtroom (even a 'courtroom' conducted on-country). The barriers to effective communication were compounded by the difficulty of translating questions and answers relating to those concepts to and from the dialects of the Western Desert.

293 In these circumstances, the anthropological evidence, if otherwise reliable, might assist in explaining the nature of the practices adopted in relation to country and the people who acknowledge and observe similar practices. An example concerns the evidence given by the Aboriginal witnesses as to the people who acknowledge and observe laws and customs similar to their own. Perhaps not surprisingly, most witnesses who were asked to address this topic had difficulty in identifying what the anthropologists described as the people of the Western Desert or of the eastern Western Desert. (An exception was Peter Wilson, a younger man educated at State schools who gave his evidence in English. He gave evidence of the extent of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, the people of which share ceremonies and the Tjukurrpa stories.) Anthropological evidence might assist in completing the picture left unfinished by the Aboriginal witnesses, or at least enable the Court better to understand the extent to which laws and customs are shared by people identifying with different tracts of country.

294 The applicants submit that in assessing the evidence of the Aboriginal witnesses, account should be taken of the cultural barriers to effective communication in a courtroom setting. I accept that there are such barriers and that they must be given due consideration. They include the obvious difficulties of translating observations about traditional customs and practices from Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara into English and vice versa (notwithstanding the conscientious efforts of the skilled interpreters); the unwillingness of some witnesses, particularly the older people, to speak about certain sensitive topics; a tendency for the witnesses to give what non-indigenous observers might regard as incomplete answers to questions (particularly to the non-leading questions that are ordinarily required in examination-in-chief); and, on occasion, a refusal for no apparent reason to respond when pressed for answers to particular questions. The barriers to communication in the present case were compounded by the physical infirmities endured by some witnesses who, clearly enough, found it a strain to concentrate and answer questions, even for relatively short periods.

295 An example of the difficulty of communication occurred when Ms Kelly, for the Territory, asked Reggie Uluru an apparently simple question in cross-examination. Mr Uluru provided what appeared to be an unresponsive answer:
 
 'MS KELLY: Is there a law, an Arnangu law, that says how a person becomes ngurraritja for a country? 
 
 
 
 
 THE INTERPRETER [Discussion in language] Yes. 
 
 MS KELLY: Can you tell us what that law is? 
 
 
 
 
 THE INTERPRETER: [Discussion in language] When the people stay with the people in the area, the local area, then that person [Discussion in language] when the people might pass away from the local group here, pass away and I might go, go away and come back and visit and find that person is no longer here. 
 
 MS KELLY: It doesn't appear that I can take that any further your Honour'. 
 

I did not attribute Mr Uluru's apparent unresponsiveness, at the time his evidence was given, to his unwillingness to co-operate with the questioner. Rather, I thought that the answer reflected his imperfect understanding of the question asked or, perhaps, a difficulty in translating his response adequately.

296 The contrast between the demeanour of witnesses when testifying in the courtroom and when giving evidence more informally on-country was sometimes striking. Nellie Armunta, for example, appeared uncomfortable in the courtroom and required frequent breaks. Her state of health was not good and giving evidence in that setting was clearly a strain for her. Yet when Armunta joined the entourage on-country at places such as Mantarurr (her father's country) and Katartitja, she showed remarkable energy and stamina for an elderly person whose health was clearly fragile. At one point during the site visit to Mantarurr, which involved some exertion in warm conditions, Armunta volunteered this comment: 'I can't see too well but ... I'm really happy today'.

365 Since the Commonwealth's submissions rely heavily upon Yorta Yorta (HC) , it is worth observing that the facts of that case were very different from those of the present case. Factual findings were made by the trial Judge in that case (see Yorta Yorta (HC) , at [95]) to the effect:
 
 'that the society which had once observed traditional laws and customs had ceased to do so and, by ceasing to do so, no longer constituted the society out of which the traditional laws and customs sprang'. 
 

The trial Judge found that the traditional way of life of the indigenous people had been suppressed and that, as a consequence, their observance of traditional practices had disintegrated. There was also positive evidence, emanating from the Aboriginal people themselves, to the same effect. This included a petition by Aboriginal people in 1881 to the Governor of New South Wales, which lamented the fact that all land within tribal boundaries had been taken by the Government and white settlers. The petitioners expressed a desire to change their 'old mode of life' in favour of 'settling down to more orderly habits of industry': Yorta Yorta , at [117]-[120], per Olney J. No comparable evidence has been adduced in the present case.

366 I emphasise that the conclusion I have reached does not determine the separate question of whether the applicants have shown that the members of the compensation claim group acknowledged and observed the laws and customs relating to native title rights and interests pleaded in the Points of Claim. Nor does it determine whether the pleaded laws and customs are the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc. These issues require separate consideration (section 17 , below).

367 Before I can conclude that the Western Desert bloc continued as a society until at least the time of the compensation acts, it is necessary to consider the effect of migratory patterns within the Western Desert. The evidence in the present case suggests that population movements in the Western Desert occurred well before European settlement. Professor A P Elkin, for example, observed in his 1939 study of 'Kinship in South Australia' that:
 
 '[t]he Aborigines of western South Australia have been in a continuous state of migration southwards for some decades; a movement which I believe was in progress before the coming of the white man'. 
 

(1939) 10 Oceania 196, at 203. In the same study, Professor Elkin noted that the major population movement had been from the Musgrave and Everard Ranges to the south, but seldom to the north 'until in quite recent decades':
 
 'Under pressure of droughts and at best constant desert conditions the groups pressed towards the south, seldom if ever to return, lengthening the mythological tracks and cutting themselves off from the spread of new forms and social and kinship organization and terminology'. 
 

(1940) 10 Oceania 295, at 305.

368 These observations are consistent with Professor Sutton's own opinion, recorded in his published works, that the Western Desert is the region of Australia that seems to have experienced the greatest demographic instability at the time of colonisation. He attributes this state of affairs to the ecological uncertainty that people faced, before the water bores were introduced and imported food became available. Professor Sutton also accepts that 'incursive movements' to the east and southeast of the Western Desert occurred during the earliest colonial phase: P M Sutton, Native Title in Australia: An Ethnographic Perspective (2003), at 143.

369 In 1930, Elkin conducted a ten month study of 'The Social Organization of South Australian Tribes'. For most of that period he was based at Oodnadatta, which is a considerable distance south of Uluru, although it appears that he ventured as far north as Ernabella. Elkin reported that he had seen 'natives in this region ... living in a totally uncivilised manner'. He noted that these people had experienced 'a specially hard time during the past ten years on account of a severe drought' and that as a result migration into the areas of white settlement had increased. Further investigations east, west and south (but not north) had shown that: 
 
 'the depopulation of this region is very far advanced, and that the causes are on the one hand, the low rainfall and poverty of the country, and, on the other hand, the comparative attractiveness of life in proximity to white settlement'. 
 

(1931) 2 Oceania 44 , at 46. Professor Elkin also noted that his investigations around Ooldea (on the southern fringes of the Western Desert) suggested that Aboriginal people had travelled there from the direction of the Everard Ranges.

567 In De Rose (FCA) , O'Loughlin J rejected (at [553]) a submission that the grant of a pastoral lease by the Crown necessarily extinguishes any native title right to control access to the land or to decide how the land is to be used. His Honour concluded that although the rights and obligations contained in pastoral leases gave superior rights to the lessee with respect to matters of access and use, that did not mean that all native title rights of access and control were necessarily extinguished. His Honour acknowledged the comment made by the majority in Ward (HC) , at [417] that:
 
 'the grants of the respective pastoral leases were inconsistent with the continued existence of the native title right to control access to and make decisions about the land'. 


 
However, he took that observation:
 
 'to constitute a statement of the position between the native title claimants on the one hand and the pastoralist on the other. I do not see that it necessarily takes away the residual rights of control of access and use as between the holders of native title themselves and any other Aboriginal people who seek access or use of the claim area in accordance with the traditional laws and customs'.

568 An appeal from O'Loughlin J's judgment was allowed, but no challenge was made to his Honour's ruling on this point. The native title determination ultimately made in De Rose (FC) (No 2) (at [171]) included a native title right to:
 
 'make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the determination area by Aboriginal people who recognise themselves to be governed by the traditional laws and customs acknowledged by Nguraritja [traditional owners] ' (par 3(l)).
 

The determination also acknowledged a native title right to maintain and protect sites and places on the determination area of significance to nguraritja (to use the spelling adopted in De Rose (FC) (No 2) ) under their traditional laws and customs (par 3(j)). Both native title rights were expressed to be subject to the rights and interests granted by the pastoral leases. The latter prevailed over the native title rights and interests, but did not extinguish them (par 10).

569 Paragraph 3(l) of the determination made in De Rose (FC) (No 2) follows closely the corresponding provision in par 5(e) of the determination made in Ward (FC) (No 2) . At one point in the present case, the Commonwealth seemed to suggest that par 5(e) of the determination in Ward (FC) (No 2) had been made by consent and therefore had no value as a precedent. However, the Full Court in that case specifically said this (at [27]):
 
 'The argument is that the right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the area cannot be recognised because the right to control access was extinguished by the grant of the pastoral leases. However, there is a clear distinction between a right to control access, generally and as a matter of law, and a right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of land by Aboriginal people who will recognise those decisions and observe them pursuant to their traditional laws and customs. The continued existence of the former right is incompatible with a pastoral lease entitling the pastoral lessee to determine who has access to the land; the latter is not. We think subcl (e) should remain'. 
 

It was presumably this paragraph in the judgment that prompted the Commonwealth to submit formally that Ward (FC) (No 2) had been incorrectly decided.</text>
