<tocase>Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293</tocase>

<text>The Federal Magistrate found the fifth complaint made out. The Tribunal was wrong to proceed on the basis that for discrimination to be considered persecution, it must be motivated by an intent to harm. The Federal Magistrate said that in that regard the Tribunal had proceeded upon an incorrect basis: Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293 at [33] to [35]. He said the Tribunal should have asked itself whether or not the activity complained of was discriminatory and whether it was Convention based.

He found that by introducing the concept of 'benevolence' the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error in determining that the conduct complained of did not amount to discrimination and thereby persecution.</text>

<tocase>VBAP of 2002 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965</tocase>

<text>In my opinion, that submission must be accepted. There might be some cases where a tribunal of this kind considering questions of this kind could fall into jurisdictional error in respect of an aspect of its deliberations which would not affect the ultimate conclusion. VBAP of 2002 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965 was one of these. However, this matter is different.

There were a number of issues before the Tribunal which needed to be resolved. First, whether the appellants were subject to persecution; secondly, whether they had a fear of persecution; thirdly, whether the fear of persecution was well founded; fourthly, whether there was adequate state protection available to the appellants; and fifthly, whether the appellants could be relocated so as to avoid any form of persecution.

The question of relocation cannot be considered in a vacuum if, in fact, there is no adequate state protection available to the appellants. The question of relocation must always depend upon there being available adequate state protection. Because the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal had fallen into error in relation to the question of state protection, it seems to me the Tribunal's decision cannot stand. The first respondent has not challenged the Federal Magistrate's reasons in relation to the Tribunal's error in relation to state protection.</text>
