<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90</tocase>
<text>The applicants' counsel told the Court that nowhere in the statements of issues and contentions of any of the parties is there a reference to either the Act or the section in question. There is no doubt that a Notice to Produce may be set aside if the documents sought by it lack apparent relevance to the proceeding: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 102-103; Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] . In this case, the documents sought have been discovered and so are prima facie relevant. Other than the assertion from the bar table that the Act and section in question are not to be found in the statements of issues and contentions, no attempt has been made by the applicants to demonstrate that the documents are not relevant. That assertion is at any rate of limited assistance: the proceeding is still at an interlocutory stage and submissions on the substantive issues between the parties are yet to be made. The tentative submission of the applicants that document 1434 is not relevant is insufficient to displace the document's prima facie relevance.</text>

<tocase>Apple v Wily [2002] NSWSC 855</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2002/855.html</AustLII>
<text>It was not argued that the applicant fell within the core definition of "client" and nor could it be, for as Barrett J said in Apple v Wily [2002] NSWSC 855 at [11] , 
 
 in its ordinary signification, must therefore be regarded as referring to a person who, in respect of some legal matter within the scope of professional services normally provided by lawyers, has, with the consent of a lawyer, come to stand in a relationship of trust and confidence to the lawyer entailing duties of the lawyer to promote the person's interests, to protect the person's rights and to respect the person's confidences."

The core meaning of the term "client" is expanded upon in s 117: see Apple v Wily [2002] NSWSC 855 at [7] . The definition is a non-exhaustive list of categories, all but one of which are not presently relevant. Paragraph (b) is "an employee or agent of a client" . It follows that if the applicants can show that, for the purpose of maintaining privilege over the Bankers Trust documents, they are the agents of Bankers Trust, then they are entitled to assert that privilege on Bankers Trust's behalf. But no evidence was led to the effect that the applicants were Bankers Trust's agents.

There was a suggestion by the applicants that they were bailees of the documents and could assert Bankers Trust's privilege in that capacity. This was met by a submission from the respondent that because the documents were sent by facsimile to the applicants there could be no bailment. This submission misunderstands the subject matter of legal professional privilege. The privilege attaches to communications and not the pieces of paper and other media on which they are recorded. A communication is essentially information and the law knows no concept of the bailment of information. For the same reason, the applicants' bailment suggestion is unsound.</text>

<tocase>Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1976/63.html</AustLII>
<text>The obligation to prove that a communication is privileged rests with the party asserting privilege: Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 689. That obligation is not discharged merely by an assertion of privilege in an affidavit verifying a list of documents: National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211. That is especially so where, as in this case, the assertion in the affidavit wrongly describes the privilege as belonging to the applicants rather than to Bankers Trust.

It is understandable that the respondent is suspicious of documents prepared by senior in-house counsel for the board of directors. In contemporary companies, senior lawyers increasingly often play management roles which will sometimes involve them creating documents that are not for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice. The descriptions provided by the appellant of the Tiffen documents, supplemented by the evidence of Mr Schoenberg, do not demonstrate conclusively that the documents are privileged. In such circumstances, often the only possible course of action is for the party claiming privilege to provide the documents to the Court and have the Court determine if the claim can be maintained: see Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 689. This is what has occurred in this case.

I have been provided by the applicants with copies of the Tiffen documents. Such copies have not, as I understand it, been provided to the respondent. I have reviewed the two documents. It is inappropriate for me to say anything more about the documents than has been said in open Court in evidence and submissions. I should, however, set out my approach to determining whether the documents are privileged.</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>Other than what is recorded at [23] and [24], no reason was given why the applicants could assert any privilege that may have attached to the documents in Bankers Trust's hands. It may be that a party to whom privileged documents are provided in circumstances that are not inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege, has a general or limited right to assert that privilege on behalf of that person. I need not decide that question here for the applicants have failed to lead any evidence of the circumstances of the provision of the documents to them. In particular, they have not proved that the provision of the documents to them was done in circumstances that were consistent with the maintenance of privilege: see Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1. The only evidence is the brief reference in Mr Schoenberg's affidavit to Bankers Trust requesting the applicants to maintain privilege in the documents. It is to be inferred that the request was not made at the time the documents were provided to the applicants, but at a later stage.

It follows from what I have said that the applicants have also failed to prove that privilege in the Bankers Trust documents was not waived. Where a document which is privileged, or alleged to be privileged, in the hands of the client for whom it was prepared, is then provided to a third party, the party claiming privilege bears the burden of proving that the provision of that document to the third party did not waive privilege. That burden will be discharged by showing that the circumstances of the provision of the document to the third party were not such as to constitute "inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege" : Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ. An ex post facto request by the client for the third party to maintain the privilege does not discharge the burden.

For these reasons, it follows that the applicants have failed to prove that they are entitled to assert privilege over the Bankers Trust documents, assuming they are privileged in Bankers Trust's hands. The motion in respect of these documents must be dismissed.

Documents 1780 and 1898 were both created by Mr Tiffen who was at the time the Chief Counsel of the applicants and an admitted and practising solicitor. Mr Tiffen has not given any evidence concerning these documents or the circumstances of their creation. However Mr Schoenberg deposes that he has been informed of certain matters by Mr Tiffen. According to Mr Schoenberg, Mr Tiffen was asked by Mr Drenth, then an employee of the applicants, to "advise him on the form of resolutions required by the Boards of certain Rio Tinto group companies to authorise those companies to enter into certain transactions" and that Mr Tiffen prepared document 1780, which is an email attaching draft board papers, in response to that request. According to Mr Schoenberg, Mr Tiffen did so in his capacity as an in-house legal counsel of the applicants and for the dominant purpose of providing Mr Drenth with legal advice.</text>

 communication may be privileged even though it is both not intended for use in litigation and not strictly speaking made for the purposes of legal advice but the purposes of providing legal assistance, eg, draft conveyances and the like: Mostyn v West Mostyn Coal Co (1876) 34 LT 531, although they are not perhaps legal advice in a literal sense."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/571.html</AustLII>
<text>In AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 at [86] , Young J referred to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Balabel v Air India [1988] Ch 317 at 330, where Taylor LJ (with whom Lord Donaldson MR and Parker LJ concurred) said: 
 
 obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice. But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege. In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages. There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and the client. ... Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach. A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as 'please advise me what I should do'. But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice. Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context. '

Counsel for the applicants described documents 1780 and 1898 respectively as "pro forma matters to be attended to by the board in order to pass certain resolutions, to give effect to approvals by the board to enter into particular legal transactions" and a list of "a number of matters that has to be attended by the board, for the purpose of giving effect to or making effective, particular resolutions" . I accept that such documents, while not formal opinions of the law, may constitute legal advice and, if prepared for that dominant purpose, may attract legal professional privilege. They may be, to adopt the words used in Balabel , "advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context" .</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 266</tocase>
<text>As well as considering whether the Tiffen documents constitute legal advice, I must also consider whether the provision of legal advice was the dominant purpose of their creation. Many adjectives have been used in an attempt to identify the dominant purpose of a communication. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that a dominant purpose is one that is of greater importance than any other: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 266 at 478. The respondent submits that the dominant purpose of document 1898 appears to be the convening of a meeting to discuss identified matters. He makes no submission on what the dominant purpose of document 1780 is, save to say that the applicants have failed to discharge their burden of demonstrating that the dominant purpose test is satisfied.

Having considered the Tiffen documents in light of the above principles, I have formed the view that each of them is subject to legal professional privilege. It is true that each of them each of them has a "corporate governance" purpose, but I am satisfied that this is not the dominant purpose of the communications contained within the documents but rather is the context in which the legal advice was given. I accept that the descriptions of the documents given to the Court by counsel for the applicants and set out at [37] are generally accurate and reflect the dominant purposes for which they were prepared.

Accordingly, I will grant the applicants relief from production of documents 1780 and 1898 on the grounds that the are the subject of legal professional privilege.</text>
