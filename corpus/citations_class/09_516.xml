<text>It seems that the authorities to which I referred in Taylor v Telstra suggest that there might be some slight difference of emphasis between the approach taken by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 and Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (No 2) (2007) 236 ALR 322. However, both of these approaches indicate that the essential question is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made by group members who will be bound by the settlement.</text>

<text>In Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66], I endeavoured to set out the principles which apply to the exercise of the power under s 33V to approve a settlement. The principles to which I referred were applied by Stone J in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] . I will apply those principles in considering the present application.</text>

<tocase>King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2001] FCA 270</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/270.html</AustLII>
<text>The opt-out requirements of Part IVA are an important element of the scheme laid down by that part of the Act. In King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2001] FCA 270 at [15] , a Full Court observed that these requirements ensure that group members can make an informed decision about their rights. The Full Court said at [15] and [16] that the opt-out notice must not mislead group members and must be expressed with clarity and simplicity.

Section 33Y provides for the Court to approve the form and content of an opt-out notice. Section 33Y(2) would ordinarily also require the Court to approve the form and content of the notice to group members advising them of the settlement. Section 33ZB(b) provides that persons who exercise the right to opt out of a proceeding under s 33J are not bound by a judgment given in a representative proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/104.html</AustLII>
<text>Also, at the time of the mediation, the company appeared to have limited financial capacity. As I have said, it was uninsured. Its last trading price was $0.01, which is the lowest price that can be quoted on the ASX. This is a matter of considerable importance in determining whether to exercise the power. I will refer later to the similar circumstances that arose in Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104.

The terms of settlement provide that the parties to the agreement are the applicants in each proceeding, the respondents and the group members referred to in each of the proceedings.

Clause 2 of the agreement provides the essential terms of the settlement, which are that there is to be a verdict for the respondents, and the respondents are to pay to the applicants the sum of $3 million in full and final settlement of both sets of proceedings.

In Lopez , Finkelstein J referred at [16] to the onerous task involved in the consideration of an application. As I mentioned earlier, the application in Lopez has some striking similarities to the situation which arises in the present matter.

That is because, in Lopez , there was a very real likelihood that if the case went to a final hearing, the group members would not receive anything like the amount they will receive upon the approval of the compromise. The reason for this was that the company was hopelessly insolvent and success in the proceeding would have left group members in a position where their claim would be reduced to the ability to prove in a winding up. As his Honour remarked at [19], "that is hardly an enticing position".

A further similarity in Lopez was that there was an insurance fund which was available. His Honour referred at [23] to the effect of s 562 of the then Corporations Law which had the effect that the approval of the settlement and the application of the insurance funds would not, in any way, adversely affect the interests of unsecured creditors of the company.

Whilst Village Life is conceded to have limited assets, what I have said about Lopez is not to suggest in any way that the company is insolvent.

In this case, as Mr Abadee submitted, the stark consequences of the Court withholding its approval to the settlement would be that any successful judgment that may be obtained by the applicants and subsequently by group members would be wiped out by the legal costs which would be incurred in pursuing the proceedings to final judgment.

The estimate of those costs provided in Mr Moulis's affidavit, is in an amount of approximately $4.8 million. Mr Moulis is an experienced practitioner in this field, and I accept his estimate as being within the range in this type of matter. It seems to me to be likely that the individual respondents, who would be entitled to indemnity from the insurer, would incur costs of that order in defending the proceedings.

Accordingly, if the matter were to proceed to a final hearing, the entire amount of the insurance fund would be eaten up by legal fees. That is, of course, an unfortunate consequence of the complexity of this type of proceeding. Nevertheless, it is a fact which informs the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement which has been reached.

Although the letter from the individual respondents' solicitors suggests that two of the respondents may have some funds at present, it is, in my view, reasonable to infer that were the matter to proceed to final judgment, all of the personal respondents would have to eat into their own assets to such an extent that there would be nothing left for the applicant and group members. That is to say there would be no financial return from success in the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>McMullen v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>In McMullen v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1 at 4, Wilcox J observed that the power in s 33ZF(1) was: 
 intended to confer on the Court the widest possible power to do whatever is appropriate or necessary in the interests of justice being achieved in a representative proceeding.

His Honour expressed the view that Part IVA involved the introduction of a novel procedure and that it was at the time impossible to foresee all the issues that might arise in the operation of the Part. He said that for that reason, it was desirable to empower the Court to make orders necessary to resolve unforeseen difficulties. As his Honour observed, the only limitation is that the Court must consider the order to be appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.

In Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 957 ; (2002) 122 FCR 168 at [48] , Sackville J observed that there are good reasons to give s 33ZF a generous interpretation. His Honour did not refer expressly to the remarks of Wilcox J in McMullen , however the passage to which I have referred from McMullen was approved by Tamberlin J in Johnstone v HIH Limited [2004] FCA 190 at [103] - [104] .</text>

<tocase>Multiplex Funds Management Ltd v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 200 ; (2007) 164 FCR 275</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/200.html</AustLII>
<text>In Multiplex Funds Management Ltd v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 200 ; (2007) 164 FCR 275 , a Full Court considered the question of whether a compulsory funding agreement in similar terms to the funding agreement of the present matter contravened the opt-out nature of representative proceedings.

Although not stated explicitly in Multiplex , it is clear enough from the analysis of the relevant provisions of Part IVA that s 33J and the right to opt out is an essential ingredient of the scheme. In spite of that, the Court came to the view that the conditions of the funding agreement which effectively imposed an opt-in requirement did not contravene the provisions of Part IVA.

I observed at [149] that the execution of the funding agreement as a condition of inclusion in the represented group operates as a substantial practical disincentive to a group member to exercise the right to opt out of the proceeding. Although the appellants in that case submitted that this subverts a fundamental principle of Part IVA , I said at [150] that group members are nevertheless entitled to opt out, and I came to the view that the funding agreement did not contravene the provisions of Part IVA. French J (as his Honour then was) and Lindgren J agreed with the views that I expressed.

I do not consider that Multiplex is authority for the proposition that the Court lacks power to dispense with the requirements of s 33J. I do not consider that the general dispensing power contained in s 33X(2) is applicable. However, in my view, there is power in s 33ZF to dispense with the requirements of opt-out notices.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2008.html</AustLII>
<text>In Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66], I endeavoured to set out the principles which apply to the exercise of the power under s 33V to approve a settlement. The principles to which I referred were applied by Stone J in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] . I will apply those principles in considering the present application.

It seems that the authorities to which I referred in Taylor v Telstra suggest that there might be some slight difference of emphasis between the approach taken by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 and Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (No 2) (2007) 236 ALR 322. However, both of these approaches indicate that the essential question is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made by group members who will be bound by the settlement.</text>
