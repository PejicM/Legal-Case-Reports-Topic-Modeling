<tocase>Duralla Pty Ltd v Plant [1984] FCA 146 ; (1984) 2 FCR 342</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/146.html</AustLII>
<text>15 There was once a time when an appeal to a Full Court of this Court was conceived to be an appeal in a strict sense than rather than an appeal by way of rehearing, the root authority for the former proposition being Duralla Pty Ltd v Plant [1984] FCA 146 ; (1984) 2 FCR 342. That early conception is now regarded as erroneous: Minister for Immigration v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 , at 533, [75], 544, [120] fn (98); Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2 ) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 434-435, [20] . Even so, that is not a licence to conduct a case in the appellate jurisdiction of this Court as if there had been no exercise of an original jurisdiction or as if an appellant had not chosen to conduct his case in a particular way and on particular grounds in that jurisdiction. The conduct of the Appellant's case on appeal exhibited a tendency, by no means unique in appeals in matters arising under the Migration Act , to treat an appeal to this Court as if it were an exercise in the direct supervision by judicial review of an Administrative Tribunal, rather than an appeal from a judicial decision. Subject to s 75(v) of the Constitution and to exceptions in the Act which are not presently material, the judicial review role in respect of a decision of the Tribunal is consigned by s 476 of the Migration Act to the Federal Magistrates Court. It is that court which is invested with the relevant original jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>17 I have emphasised the words "is satisfied" in the definition of "spouse" because they indicate that one of the "facts" upon the existence of which the Minister's power to grant this type of visa is conditioned is a state of Ministerial "satisfaction" in respect of specified criteria. The following observations of Gummow J in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 651, [130] - [131] are therefore apposite:
 "The 'jurisdictional fact', upon the presence of which jurisdiction is conditioned, need not be a 'fact' in the ordinary meaning of that term. The precondition or criterion may consist of various elements and whilst the phrase 'jurisdictional fact' is an awkward one in such circumstances it will, for convenience, be retained in what follows. In Bankstown Municipal Council v Fripp, Isaacs and Rich JJ pointed out that, with the object of preventing litigation on questions of jurisdictional fact, the legislature may introduce into the criterion elements of opinion or belief by the decision-maker. ... A determination that the decision-maker is not 'satisfied' that an applicant answers a statutory criterion which must be met before the decision-maker is empowered or obliged to confer a statutory privilege or immunity goes to the jurisdiction of the decision-maker and is reviewable under s 75(v) of the Constitution ." (internal footnote references omitted)

19 To this Gummow J added in Eshetu , supra at 654, [137]:
 "This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question. It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way."

20 Later in his judgement in Eshetu , supra at 656-657, [145] Gummow J stated:
 "Where the issue whether a statutory power was enlivened turns upon the further question of whether the requisite satisfaction of the decision-maker was arrived at reasonably, I would not adopt the criterion advanced by Lord Wilberforce. I would prefer the scrutiny of the written statement provided under s 430 by a criterion of "reasonableness review". This would reflect the significance attached earlier in these reasons to the passage extracted from the judgment of Gibbs J in Buck v Bavone. It would permit review in cases where the satisfaction of the decision-maker was based on findings or inferences of fact which were not supported by some probative material or logical grounds."</text>

<tocase>Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1976/24.html</AustLII>
<text>18 A "satisfaction" based administrative decision is amenable to judicial review on one or more of the bases described by Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119:
 "In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously. Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account. Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it. However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached."

20 Later in his judgement in Eshetu , supra at 656-657, [145] Gummow J stated:
 "Where the issue whether a statutory power was enlivened turns upon the further question of whether the requisite satisfaction of the decision-maker was arrived at reasonably, I would not adopt the criterion advanced by Lord Wilberforce. I would prefer the scrutiny of the written statement provided under s 430 by a criterion of "reasonableness review".

<tocase>Tolibao Cortes v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1183</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1183.html</AustLII>
<text>23 There is no want of logicality in the Tribunal's reasons. Those reasons discharge the statutory obligation with respect to reasons cast on the tribunal by s 368 of the Migration Act , as the learned Magistrate correctly concluded. The Tribunal's absence of "satisfaction" was based on evidence, not, as the Appellant contended, suspicion, cf Tolibao Cortes v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1183. Appeal grounds 3, 4 and 6 fail.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/1.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The Appellant contends that the Tribunal should have referred in its reasons to receipts, letters, statutory declarations made by the Appellant, his spouse and their friends, utility bills, photographs and two home videos. The law does not require this. The Tribunal is not obliged "to give a line by line refutation of the evidence for the claimant either generally or in those respects where there is evidence that is contrary to findings of material fact made by the Tribunal": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at 416, [65] . Appeal ground 2 fails.

25 Prior to reaching its decision the Tribunal sent to the Appellant a letter dated 9 August 2006 in which attention was drawn to and comment invited upon there being little substantive evidence in 2002 of a then continuing relationship, to the notes of field visits (copies of which were enclosed) to the claimed matrimonial residence which it was said raised doubts as to whether the Appellant and his wife resided together or were in a spousal relationship, to the Appellant's inconsistencies in response at interview as mentioned in the Ministerial delegate's reasons, to an absence of spousal identification on tax returns, to the Appellant's having bills sent to his aunt's address, to his wife's having purchased a house in her own name and to the Appellant's residing regularly at his aunt's house.

26 The delegate had noted, inter alia, of the Appellant's responses at interview, "the sponsor was emphatic that she did not want children" whereas, in the record of a previous hearing in the Tribunal, she had been recorded as saying that she and the Appellant, "love each other and plan to have children".</text>
