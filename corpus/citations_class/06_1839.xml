<text>1 The factual context of, and the general legal issues arising out of, Mr Clarkson's complaints about the failure to investigate the circumstances of his incarceration as a federal offender in a State prison have been outlined in my judgment in Clarkson v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCA 1348.

2 I have already dismissed his claims against four of the six respondents. Two remain, one relating to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the other to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ("HREOC").

3 The application against the Ombudsman is bought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("AD(JR) Act") and challenges alleged decisions of the Ombudsman not to investigate three matters. These are:
 
 
 "1. The decision made not to investigate the actions taken by Correctional Officers at Junee CC to sabotage the appeals and education of the Applicant.
 
 2. The decision made not to investigate the failure of the Commonwealth to monitor the administration of sentences served by Federal Offenders. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The decision made not to investigate the failure of the Commonwealth to amend the 1990 Commonwealth/State NSW Agreement to include terms designed ensure compliance with the ICCPR Protocols and otherwise according to law."</text>

<tocase>S v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 143</tocase>
<text>9 In my earlier decision I indicated at par 22 that I was prepared to accept, for the purposes of this application, that notwithstanding the Arrangement, the Commonwealth may nonetheless retain tutelary responsibilities towards federal offenders in State prisons which might in exceptional circumstances found a claim in tort: cf S v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 549 ; (2005) 143 FCR 217; or for injunctive or mandatory orders against the Commonwealth.

10 There are several difficulties with the review sought of this decision. It is not apparent that the failure alleged related to a matter of administration being action taken by a department or by a prescribed authority. At best it seems to relate to a residual responsibility formally vested in the Governor-General as a party to the Arrangement or else to the Commonwealth acting through the relevant portfolio Minister. In either circumstance the matter does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to investigate.

11 I should add notwithstanding my reference to a residual tutelary responsibility in the Commonwealth, there is nothing in the material that has been filed by Mr Clarkson which, in my view, could properly be said to come near to exciting a duty in the Commonwealth to monitor his circumstances or for that matter the administration of sentences served by federal offenders. I will order that the application as against the third respondent be dismissed.</text>
