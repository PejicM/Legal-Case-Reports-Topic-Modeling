<text>5 It is always accepted that a stay should be granted when there is a real risk that the integrity of a controversy, or the subject of the appeal, would otherwise be rendered nugatory. An appeal's subject matter would be rendered nugatory if there exists a real risk that it would not be possible for a successful appellant to be restored substantially to its former position if the judgment against an applicant is executed: see generally, Enterprise Goldmines N L v Mineral Horizons N L (1988) 91 FLR 403 at 410; Scarborough v Lew's Junction Stores Pty Ltd (1963) VR 129 at 130; Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66; and Cellante v G Kallis Industries Pty Ltd (1992) 2 VR 653 at 657.</text>
