<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/1358.html</AustLII>
<text>7 The principles to be applied by the Court in determining an application to set aside a statutory demand are also not in dispute. The Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ultradrilling and West about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates: s 459H(1)(a) of the Act . That issue is determined at the time the Court hears the application: Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 at [16] . For a genuine dispute to exist, the dispute must "be bona fide and truly exist in fact". The grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute must be "real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived": Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G&amp;M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 464; see also John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 250 at 253 and TR Administration Pty Ltd v Frank Marchetti &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 70 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 67 at 79.</text>

<tocase>Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 239 ALR 749</tocase>
<text>6 The function of the Court, on review of a Registrar's decision under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court Act , is to rehear the case and decide the facts for itself. It is a hearing de novo. That is to say, it is a complete rehearing at which the parties may adduce further evidence. It is for the Court to be satisfied of the matters prescribed by the Act and to exercise the discretion unfettered by the decision of the Registrar. The cases that make good those propositions include: Mazukov v University of Tasmania [2004] FCAFC 159 at [22] - [27] ; and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634 at [6] and [12] and Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 239 ALR 749 at [46].

28 There is sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling caused by its own conduct. It is important to note that Ultradrilling's contentions proceeded not on the basis that there could be no implied term relating to time but that the legal argument there existed one or more implied terms covering all of the instances set out in the schedule to the letter dated 7 February 2008 was "patently feeble". That contention is understandable. However, the evidence before the Court on these issues (including the terms of the contract) is not exhaustive: cf TR Administration 66 ACSR at 81-82. Indeed, what evidence was before the Court suggested that there was in fact no formal, integrated written contract, but instead a series of emails, purchase orders, and invoices, including the Purchase Order partially set out above.</text>

<tocase>Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal [2004] NSWSC 560</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/560.html</AustLII>
<text>37 Ultradrilling submitted that the fact that West now puts forward these details of the offsetting claim to overcome the difficulties identified by the Deputy Registrar should tell strongly against the genuineness of the claim, both on the issue of whether the delays are recoverable by West against Ultradrilling and the amount of any such claim. In any event, Ultradrilling contends that the evidence now provided does not rise above mere assertion and should be rejected on that basis alone: see Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal [2004] NSWSC 560 at [18] - [19] and TR Administration 66 ACSR at 79-80. Ultradrilling focused, in particular, on the charges for "lost mark up" and the "lost profit" on the pumps (see [35] above). Ultradrilling contended that if, as was required, a line was drawn to distinguish between evidence that was merely spurious, bluster or assertion and evidence which provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile, the offsetting claim would be dismissed: TR Administration at 79-80.

38 I reject this submission. What this application has demonstrated is that the terms on which West engaged Ultradrilling to drill bore holes and the manner in which Ultradrilling completed that work is the subject of dispute. Those issues cannot be resolved and should not be resolved in the present application. Moreover, it must be recalled that West is not required to establish the precise dollars and cents or provide a fully evidenced claim: Elm Financial Services at [19].

39 Secondly, the bases on which Ultradrilling contends that charges for "lost mark up" and the "lost profit" on the pumps are spurious cannot be accepted. "Lost mark up" was criticised by Ultradrilling on the grounds that "[t]he sense in which this amount was 'lost' [was] unexplained." However, that loss was explained. In Mr West's additional affidavit and accompanying spreadsheet (see [35]-[36] above), it was described as the margin which West would have received on the engineer's labour - that is, the difference between the rate charged to the client and the rate actually paid to the engineer. Whether such loss is recoverable from Ultradrilling and if so, whether 30% is the correct rate to apply in calculating the loss, are issues to be determined in other forums. The other loss, the "lost profit" component, was challenged by Ultradrilling on the basis that because the pumps were said to be custom-built for the Project, there could be no "usual practice" for renting the pumps and it was not plausible to assume that each of the pumps, if not required on the Project, would have been immediately rented out for the whole period to a third party at $110 per day. Again, those are issues that will need to be resolved in another forum.

40 In the present case, it cannot be said that the evidence was merely spurious, bluster or assertion. The evidence ultimately provided by West provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile. Whether West will succeed at any trial of the issue is irrelevant.

41 Adding together the $47,916 in genuine dispute and the approximately $151,610 in offsetting claims yields a total amount which exceeds the balance of $155,397 claimed by Ultradrilling pursuant to the Statutory Demand. In the circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the Statutory Demand be set aside under s 459H(3) of the Act and that Ultradrilling pay West's costs of and incidental to the application, both before the Registrar and this Court, such costs to be taxed in default of agreement.

42 In view of those orders, it is unnecessary to separately consider setting aside the Statutory Demand on one or more of the grounds set out in s 459J of the Act .

<text>7 The principles to be applied by the Court in determining an application to set aside a statutory demand are also not in dispute. The Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ultradrilling and West about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates: s 459H(1)(a) of the Act . That issue is determined at the time the Court hears the application: Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 at [16] . For a genuine dispute to exist, the dispute must "be bona fide and truly exist in fact". The grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute must be "real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived": Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G&amp;M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 464; see also John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 250 at 253 and TR Administration Pty Ltd v Frank Marchetti &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 70 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 67 at 79.

8 The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute. The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at [40] . The Court determines only whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by West depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists. As Young J said in John Holland Construction 14 ACSR at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required: see also Micha International Pty Limited v Jong Seol Lee [2008] NSWSC 921 at [5] and Solarite Air Conditioning Pty Ltd v York International Australia Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 411 at [23] .</text>

<tocase>Rhagodia Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd (2008) 67 ACSR 367</tocase>
<text>22 I reject Ultradrilling's "failure to particularise" contention on a number of bases. First, it cannot be said that when Mr West identified incidents allegedly caused by Ultradrilling and giving rise to the need to place Ultradrilling on standby pending further instructions, he was purporting to give a complete list. So much is made clear by the language of para [12] of his affidavit of 29 May 2008. Secondly, it is apparent from the contemporaneous correspondence before the Court that Macmahon itself attributed delays on the Project to what it described as "lack of production" by Ultradrilling. In those circumstances and having regard to the nature of the incidents identified, it is neither possible nor appropriate for a Court in a proceeding of this nature to seek an exhaustive list of each incident, determine its cause, and then ascertain the time and cost of any such delay. There is objective evidence that there is a genuine dispute about whether Ultradrilling was entitled to charge separately for "other standby" for the whole of the amount of $18,634. Put another way, contrary to the submissions of Ultradrilling, it cannot be said that the dispute as to the whole of the amount is a "patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence": Rhagodia Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd (2008) 67 ACSR 367 at [93] (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). There is "sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation" as to the truth of the assertion: Rhagodia at [93] (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

23 As noted earlier, West contended that it also had offsetting claims of $120,420 against Ultradrilling based on Ultradrilling's alleged delay in completing the drilling work that was said to constitute a breach of the contract between West and Ultradrilling. The losses arising from the breach were said by Mr West in his 29 May affidavit to comprise:
 
1. $18,152 for internal administrative costs;
 
2. $31,990 short payment from Macmahon; and
 
3. $70,278 for other delay costs incurred by West.

24 Before turning to consider these amounts, it is necessary to say something about the general nature and alleged cause of the offsetting claims. There is no dispute that the Project was delayed. As noted earlier, what is in dispute is the cause of the delays and, having determined the cause, the precise costs resulting from those delays and their recoverability under the contract (i.e. whether the delays constitute breaches of one or more terms of the contract). Some of the costs said to arise from the delays I have already considered (see [18] to [22] above).</text>

9 The test to be applied in determining whether an offsetting claim exists is the same as that applied in ascertaining the existence of a genuine dispute: TR Administration Pty Ltd 66 ACSR at 79.

10 As noted earlier, Ultradrilling was engaged by West as a subcontractor on the Project to undertake extensive drilling work. West in turn had been hired by head contractor Macmahon Contractors Pty Ltd ("Macmahon"). The Statutory Demand issued by Ultradrilling claims an amount that is said to represent the balance due to it from West for the drilling work done pursuant to the contract. The genuine dispute alleged by West is whether certain amounts are in fact payable and owing under the contract; the offsetting claim is for losses said to arise out of Ultradrilling's breach of the contract due to its delay in completing the work.

11 West contends that of the $155,397 remaining unpaid on the Statutory Demand, there is a genuine dispute in relation to $47,916 arising from excessive and incorrect charges by Ultradrilling.

28 There is sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling caused by its own conduct. It is important to note that Ultradrilling's contentions proceeded not on the basis that there could be no implied term relating to time but that the legal argument there existed one or more implied terms covering all of the instances set out in the schedule to the letter dated 7 February 2008 was "patently feeble".

In any event, Ultradrilling contends that the evidence now provided does not rise above mere assertion and should be rejected on that basis alone: see Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal [2004] NSWSC 560 at [18] - [19] and TR Administration 66 ACSR at 79-80. Ultradrilling focused, in particular, on the charges for "lost mark up" and the "lost profit" on the pumps (see [35] above). Ultradrilling contended that if, as was required, a line was drawn to distinguish between evidence that was merely spurious, bluster or assertion and evidence which provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile, the offsetting claim would be dismissed: TR Administration at 79-80.</text>
