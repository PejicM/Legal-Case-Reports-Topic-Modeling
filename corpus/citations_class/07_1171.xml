<text>4 In light of these omissions before the Federal Magistrate, I am not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that it is appropriate for this Court to entertain on appeal any further dispute in relation to the alleged misinterpretation and the effect which it may have had on the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. In any event, these matters were not raised in the Notice of Appeal before this Court, and have not been addressed by the appellant in submissions. Moreover, insofar as the appellant alleges that the Tribunal did not act logically or rationally in deciding the case, no information was given, no specifics were set out and no argument was put to the Court to support this contention. In any case, the Full Court of this Court has held on several occasions that the mere fact that a decision is not logical is not of itself a ground for judicial review: NACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [29] ; W404/01A of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 255 at [35] ; VWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 286 at [18] .</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63</tocase>

<text>6 In its recent decision in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 at [35] (' SZBEL '), the High Court enunciated the principle that if the Tribunal takes no step to identify and raise an issue other than those which the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered important comprise all the issues in relation to the decision under review. In the present case, the Federal Magistrate accepted that there was an issue which was different which was considered by the Tribunal. However, having regard to the transcript of the proceedings in the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrate formed the view that the issue had been referred to as an important question by the Tribunal, which was sufficient to satisfy the principle set out in SZBEL .

7 In SZBEL , the High Court refers to an obligation on the Tribunal to invite an applicant to amplify any aspect which it believes will be taken into account and of which the applicant may not be aware. It is not necessary, according to the reasoning in SZBEL , to expressly challenge an applicant by directly putting a proposition contradictory to his or her submissions, but it is important that the matter should at least be referred to. In the present case, I am of the view that the transcript indicates that the Tribunal did signal a concern in relation to the question now raised by the appellant on appeal, namely, his reasons for not going back to Karachi. The Tribunal raised these questions and indicated their importance in questions 46 through to 57 of the transcript before the Tribunal.

8 In those circumstances, although the principles of SZBEL are indeed called into play, I consider that the task imposed on the Tribunal by those principles has been satisfied. Accordingly, having heard the submissions of the appellant and having considered the reasoning of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate below, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs as it does not have any substance and in particular because the question of misinterpretation was not raised either before the Federal Magistrate or in the Notice of Appeal before this Court.

9 For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed. I will fix costs in this matter at $4000.
