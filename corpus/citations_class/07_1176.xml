<tocase>Joss v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>25 By Order 52 rule 15(2), the time limit may be extended 'for special reasons'. To justify an extension of time, there must be 'a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry date of 21 days:' Joss v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195. In that case the expression 'special reasons' was characterised as 'an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served'.</text>

<text>23 The Tribunal's decision here is a privative clause decision, as defined by s 474(2) of the Act. Section 474 validly operates to prevent the judicial review of all decisions under the Act, except those vitiated by jurisdictional error: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476.

24 By Order 52 rule 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules , the time limit for filing a notice of appeal is 21 days from the date of the judgment, which was given on 18 April 2007. Taking into account Order 3 rule 2(2), the notice of appeal was required to have been filed on or before 9 May 2007. The application for an extension of time was filed on 22 May 2007. This is a delay of 13 days.</text>
