<text>12 Alternatively, even if it can be said that the present proceeding is based upon a cause of action that differs in certain respects from the case that was determined by Gray J, so that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply, it is at least arguable that principles of issue estoppel, or Anshun estoppel, prevent these claims from being pursued. See generally Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589; see also VWZG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1018 at [10] - [14] .

13 The applicant was not represented before me. She said that she had signed the 20 June 2003 letter indicating that she wished to withdraw her application for review in circumstances where she had not appreciated the effect of adopting that course. She was not legally represented at the time, and had merely been given informal advice by a migration agent. She claimed, in relation to this proceeding, that she had approached a lawyer to act for her, but had been told that there was some impediment to that lawyer doing so. She indicated that the lawyer had expressed concern about being personally liable for any costs that might be incurred in pursuing the litigation.

14 I must say that I have some difficulty in accepting this account in its entirety. Nonetheless, even if what I was told was correct, the applicant still faces difficulties in pursuing this application.</text>

<tocase>Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/67.html</AustLII>
<text>19 If the time limits set out in the High Court Rules are applicable to this proceeding, the principles that govern the exercise of the power to enlarge time under those rules were outlined with great clarity by McHugh J in Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491. In particular, his Honour observed that a case "would need to be exceptional" before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months. In deciding whether or not to enlarge time, the Court may take into account any explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings, and the applicant's prospects for success in the proceedings. Moreover, as the constitutional writs are directed at the acts or decisions of public bodies or officials, the public interest requires that there be an end to litigation regarding the efficacy of such acts or decisions.

20 At [16] of his reasons for judgment, McHugh J observed:
 
 "Independently of the merits of the case, I find it difficult to see how a person who, with knowledge of the decision, delays 17 months before seeking relief could ever be granted an extension of time to quash such a decision unless some conduct of the respondent or the public body or official had brought about the delay. As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council said in Ratnam v Cumarasamy , "[t]he rules of court must prima facie be obeyed". The time for seeking certiorari is six times, and the time for seeking mandamus is twice, the period in which an application for special leave to appeal to this court can be brought against a judgment or decision. The periods for applying for certiorari and mandamus give a person affected by an adverse decision or judgment ample time in which to commence proceedings in this court. In all but very exceptional cases, they should be rigidly applied when, as here, more than one year has elapsed between the decision and the commencement of proceedings in this court." (footnotes omitted)

21 In Applicant M70 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 132 , a Full Court (Heerey, Dowsett and Bennett JJ) cited these comments of McHugh J, and said at [8]:
 
 "Applying those observations and, by analogy, the time limits in the High Court Rules to the present case, relief should be declined for reason of delay."

22 It may be noted that the expression "by analogy" in the passage set out above lends support to Gray J's view that the time limits set out in the High Court Rules do not ordinarily apply to matters that have been remitted to this Court. It is, of course, possible that the judge who remits the matter to this Court will order that those time limits do apply. However, that did not occur in this case.

23 I should add that although the applicant seeks an order nisi for a writ of prohibition, as well as an order nisi for a writ of certiorari, and there is no specific time limit in the High Court Rules in relation to prohibition, it is plain that she can gain no comfort from this. Prohibition is not an appropriate remedy when challenging a decision of the Tribunal that has already been made. There is nothing left to prohibit. Once the Tribunal has made its decision, it has no further function to perform.</text>

<tocase>Re Ruddock; Ex parte Reyes (2000) 177 ALR 484</tocase>
<text>24 If the order nisi for a writ of prohibition is directed to the Minister, seemingly with the intention of preventing her from giving effect to the Tribunal's decision, the remedy may, nonetheless, be inappropriate. In Re Ruddock; Ex parte Reyes (2000) 177 ALR 484 (" Reyes "), McHugh J held that even if certiorari was granted to quash the Tribunal's decision, there should be no order for prohibition against the Minister. His Honour said at [23]:
 
 "there is no ground whatever in a case such as the present for the issue of a writ of prohibition against the minister. As was conceded, as the law stands at the moment and on the facts of the case, the minister was under a duty, in accordance with s 198 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act ), to deport the applicant. No claim for prohibition could possibly be made on the basis of his personal fault or breach of the law or jurisdictional error."

25 McHugh J went on to say that the proper remedies in a case in which a decision of the Tribunal is challenged are certiorari and mandamus, both of which should be directed to the Tribunal.

26 The reasoning in Reyes seems difficult to reconcile with the later decision of Merkel J in Thayananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1054 in which his Honour accepted the possibility that prohibition might be an appropriate remedy in cases of this type.</text>
