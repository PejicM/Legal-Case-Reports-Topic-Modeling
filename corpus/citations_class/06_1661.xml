<text>The parties have isolated some issues which need to be determined in order that the matter can be brought to a conclusion following the delivery of reasons ( Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd v McGrath; in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1403). The first thing to note is that there was an error in the reasons in relation to MSD costs etc which should have been deducted from revenue, not gross profit. The parties are agreed about that and the ultimate orders should reflect that correction.

The second matter for consideration is whether or not, in saying what I did at paragraph 104 of the judgment, I intended to include savings of wages costs together with the MSD costs in assessing an amount of 15 per cent, rather than 20 per cent as proposed by Mr McGuiness. I believe that is what I said and it is what I intended. I accepted the methodology of Mr McGuiness in general, but, as I explained, when I looked at his assessment of the various integers, including wages costs savings, the overall view I came to was that 15 per cent in total rather than 20 per cent in total was the correct figure.

The next issue for determination arises out of the necessity to allow for interest on an emerging or pro rata basis. In the course of doing that on monthly rests, it appeared that in three months more revenue was earned than what was called the 'benchmark' which represented spreading the actual loss over the period. The way the applicant's spreadsheet is composed means that the ultimate principal amount varies from the amount allowed in the judgment because of the effect of those months. There is no scope at this stage for any variation of the assessment I made of $4 million for that particular component, whatever the result may be in terms of interest, and the final figures should not reflect any variation of the principal sums that I have assessed and found in the judgment. It seems to me that, subject to checking the arithmetic, the respondent's latest spreadsheet probably reflects the principles that I have enunciated.</text>
