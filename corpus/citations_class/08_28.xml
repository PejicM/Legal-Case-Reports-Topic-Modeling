<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>

<text>35 Counsel also contend that Mr Hadgkiss's failure to give evidence in regard to the changes to the investigation is significant. Counsel submitted that the inference of an improper purpose raised, so it is said, by the changes to the investigation are not rebutted by Mr Hadgkiss and therefore, the inference should be accepted by the Court; see Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. Counsel submit it was not sufficient for the ABCC's solicitor, through the admission of her letter asserting a changed position, to rebut the inference without Mr Hadgkiss deposing to the changed position himself.

36 Counsel also submit that there is nothing on the face of the flyer that would support an allegation of breach of s 816. Counsel suggested that the better construction of the flyer was that it admonished people who co-operated with the ABCC rather than those who gave evidence or intended to give evidence to the AIRC, as the flyer says nothing about AIRC proceedings. They contend that a substantial purpose of the investigation is to investigate lack of co-operation with the ABCC.</text>

<text>37 As Gaudron J said in Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 at 672:
 
 An improper purpose will not lightly be inferred and, by application of a presumption of regularity, will only be inferred if the evidence cannot be reconciled with the proper exercise of the power...</text>

<tocase>The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCAFC 175</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/175.html</AustLII>
<text>38 Justice Tamberlin (with whom Branson and Finn JJ agreed on that issue) applied that approach in The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCAFC 175 at [126] to [127]. His Honour also referred to "the test of substantiality necessary to establish improper purpose" referred to in Thompson v The Council of the Municipality of Randwick Corporation [1950] HCA 33 ; (1950) 81 CLR 87 at 106. In Thompson at 106, Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ said that a purpose is an "ulterior" one:
 
 ...if such a purpose is a substantial purpose in the sense that no attempt would have been made to resume this land if it had not been desired to reduce the cost of the new road by the profit arising from its re-sale.</text>

<tocase>Thompson v The Council of the Municipality of Randwick Corporation [1950] HCA 33 ; (1950) 81 CLR 87</tocase>

<text>38 Justice Tamberlin (with whom Branson and Finn JJ agreed on that issue) applied that approach in The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCAFC 175 at [126] to [127].

39 To meet the Thompson test of substantiality, the applicants must prove that the investigation by the ABCC into alleged contraventions of s 816 of the WR Act would not have been commenced had it not been for the desire to question union officials about their lack of co-operation or encouraging lack of co-operation with the ABCC.

40 The evidence can be reconciled with the proper exercise of power. Section 52 of the BCII Act has been engaged because Mr Hadgkiss is investigating an alleged contravention of a designated building law by building industry participants. The particulars given in the notices to attend for questioning refer to alleged breaches of s 816. It is not to the point that the allegations as particularised may be weak or that the flyer relied upon may be open to an explanation not related to s 816.

41 Further the test of substantiality is not met. The evidence does not support the proposition that the investigation would not have occurred but for a desire to question union officials about their attitude to co-operation with the ABCC. The 29 October 2007 notice to Mr Washington and Mr Balta make serious allegations about the conduct of Mr Setka with respect to Mr Peterson and Mr Broadhead which seek to connect that conduct with their provision of information to the AIRC and appearances before it.</text>
