<text>Accordingly, s 471B of the Corporations Act prohibits a person beginning or continuing a proceeding against a company in liquidation except with the leave of the Court. The provision ensures that a company in liquidation does not face a multiplicity of legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming, and potentially unnecessary: Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) [2009] FCA 42 at [17] to [19].

<tocase>BHG Nominees Pty Ltd v Ellis Young Investments Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1998) 16 ACLC 1539</tocase>
<text>In these respects, the case is said to be analogous to BHG Nominees Pty Ltd v Ellis Young Investments Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1998) 16 ACLC 1539 where Weinberg J, in granting leave, stated: 
 The amount and seriousness of the claim and the degree and complexity of the legal questions involved all tell in favour of this matter proceeding to judgment rather than being dealt with by proof of claim in the winding up. If leave were refused, and a claim pursued, it is likely that it would be rejected by the liquidator and an appeal from his decision would therefore be initiated in any event ... (at 1544)

As to the amount of the claim by Merrill Lynch, the quantum of the applicants' claims is yet to be fully particularised but it includes, according to the statement of claim, the marketable value of each Borrower's mortgaged securities less the amount outstanding to Lift under each of the Borrower's loans.

The applicants claim that as at 10 April 2008: 
 (a) the amounts outstanding in respect of the loans made by Lift under the Swaby Agreement, the First Crabb Agreement and the Second Crabb Agreement were $17,614,680.69, $7,783,483.02 and $3,869,520.22 respectively, a total of $29,267,683.93; and
 (b) the market value of the Borrower's securities mortgaged in favour of Lift to secure the amounts outstanding under the Swaby Agreement, the First Crabb Agreement and the Second Crabb Agreement was $38,540,206.35, $31,284,721.44 and $18,866,221.50 respectively, a total market value of $88,691,149.29.

Finally, I note that in BHG Nominees Pty Ltd v Ellis Young Investments Pty Ltd, where leave was granted, Weinberg J proceeded on the basis that if leave were to have been refused and a claim pursued, it is likely that it would be rejected by the liquidator and an appeal pursued in any event. That is not this case.</text>

<text>The starting point is that a claimant must lodge a proof of debt unless that person can demonstrate there is good reason to depart from that procedure. The rationale for this approach is that a liquidator's attention and resources should not be diverted by litigation where there is a simpler procedure available, by way of proof of debt, with a right of appeal under s 1321 of the Act: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317; Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] ACTSC 124 at [33].

<text>Section 471B of the Corporations Act itself is silent as to the principles pursuant to which leave to proceed will be granted: King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369 at [13] . The court's discretion is broad but not absolute, and must be exercised fairly. It can only be exercised if a serious question is shown: King v Yurisch [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 598 at [9] [15]; Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 at 556. The test which is akin to that of whether there is a "serious question to be tried" as applied in interlocutory injunctions: Vagrand at 556. The authorities have not established an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which it may be appropriate for the Court to grant leave to proceed: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd [1983] 2 Qd R 314 at 317G per McPherson J (with whom the Court agreed).

As was stated by McPherson J in Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd (and as was approved by the Full Federal Court in Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 at 555): 
 The question whether a claimant should be permitted to proceed by action, or should be required to submit his proof of debt and, if dissatisfied, appeal to a judge, is therefore reduced largely to one of choosing between alternative forms of procedure: at 317E.

However it is for Merrill Lynch to demonstrate that one procedure, civil litigation, rather than another, the proof of debt process, is more appropriate in all the circumstances: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317.

The starting point is that a claimant must lodge a proof of debt unless that person can demonstrate there is good reason to depart from that procedure. The rationale for this approach is that a liquidator's attention and resources should not be diverted by litigation where there is a simpler procedure available, by way of proof of debt, with a right of appeal under s 1321 of the Act: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317; Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] ACTSC 124 at [33].

Claims for unliquidated damages in contract, and for misleading or deceptive conduct, are admissible to proof in a liquidation: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317; Meehan v Stockmans Australian Caf&eacute; (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 123 at 128.

See generally: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317; Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd at [30], [32]; Lawless v Mackendrick (No 2) [2008] WASC 15 at [35] ; Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) (No 2) [2009] FCA 42 ; Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd and Ors v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Pty Ltd and Ors [2004] NSWSC 406.

Merrill Lynch submits that while it may be accepted that the starting position is that there should be good reason to depart from the proof of debt procedure in favour of Court proceedings ( Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317E-F; King v Yurisich at [13], 600), each of the first five factors above weighs heavily in favour of the grant of leave in the circumstances of this matter.

Courts have dismissed applications for leave to proceed against a company in liquidation under s 471B in circumstances including: 
 (a) where leave is sought in third party proceedings which would slow the liquidation to the pace of an action under the control of others, and where the issues in the third party proceedings are distinct from those in the primary proceedings: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd , 319 320. 

 
 (b) where the claimant fails to adduce evidence demonstrating any seriousness or complexity to the claim, or the existence of a serious dispute: Nu Life Air Conditioning Pty Ltd v Reef Building Contractors Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1245 at [7] ; 

 
 (c) where the claimant asserts liability and sought a declaration of entitlement to be paid, of a type provable in liquidation: HP Mercantile v Australian Rural Group [2005] NSWSC 895 at [31] [32]; 

 
 (d) where the claim is too onerous on a liquidator, even if it may not be capable of resolution by the lodging of a proof of debt: for instance, where the company in liquidation is an insurer, and 'the disruption to the work of the provisional liquidators and the expense which would be occasioned by dealing with [claims] on an ad hoc basis would unduly prejudice the creditors as a whole': Roots v Trussmaster Pty Ltd [2001] QSC 295 at [8] ; 

 
 (e) where the proceeding would dissipate funds otherwise available to the creditors in circumstances where the liquidators agreed to admit a proof of debt in the entire amount of the claim: Rodgers v Schmierer, In the matter of Reader [2002] FCA 717 at [15] [16].</text>

The liquidators have said the likelihood is that the Merrill Lynch breach of warranty claim would be admitted to proof as a contingent debt if submitted in the same or similar terms. The likelihood of a proof of debt being admitted is a powerful factor in favour of permitting the proof of debt process to be followed: Rodgers v Schmierer; in the matter of Reader [2002] FCA 717 at [15] - [16] . This would obviate any need for the liquidators to consider the misleading and deceptive conduct claim. These are, together, very significant considerations in the disposition of the motion. Stage to which the proceedings have progressed

As I said previously I expect that the trial of the proceedings will likely take place in the first part of next year. There is no suggestion that these proceedings or the proposed cross-claim will delay the completion of the liquidation.

Lift has already had a significant degree of involvement in the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Tyrrell v Tyrrells Building Consultancy Pty Ltd (2008) 66 ACSR 134</tocase>
<text>In some cases, leave should be granted under s 471B because the litigation is a necessary prerequisite to the claimant being able to submit a proof of debt at all: for example, because the primary claim is one for apportionment. The proposed cross-claim is, I accept, not a claim of this type, but rather in effect, a claim for contribution. This is capable of being dealt with by proof of debt: Tyrrell v Tyrrells Building Consultancy Pty Ltd (2008) 66 ACSR 134 at 141.

Merrill Lynch submits that it would be unreasonable that they, if unsuccessful in the proceedings commenced by the applicants, and the cross-claim was not determined in the proceedings, be later required to proceed with a separate action against the liquidators by way of a proof of debt. Amongst other things, they say that the risk of inconsistency between findings made by this Court in relation to the applicants' claims against Merrill Lynch and findings made by the liquidators in their adjudication of a proof of debt, gives rise to the potential for significant prejudice to Merrill Lynch if they are not granted leave to file the proposed cross-claim.

I will now consider the first five factors set out under para [29] above. Amount and seriousness of the claim and complexity of the legal and factual issues</text>
