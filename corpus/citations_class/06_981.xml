<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 10 ; (1978) 138 CLR 210</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/10.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The second ("the lack of marketability") contention involves some examination of case law relating to land and in particular the decisions of the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 10 ; (1978) 138 CLR 210 and of Rogers J in Barina Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 4 NSWLR 96.

33 Later in these reasons I find that the Bulletin Place property was held for the purpose of development, strata subdivision and sale of subdivided lots. In light of this finding the question the 1997 Act requires to be answered is whether the envisioned sale of the subdivided lots would be in the ordinary course of business. For reasons I give below, I am satisfied that this "one venture": cf Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd (in liq) , above, at 237-238, of holding the Bulletin Place property for the purpose I have found, necessarily entailed that the envisioned sale of lots would occur in the ordinary course of a business of developing, etc the Bulletin Place property. That business was functioning in the 1998 tax year, as will later become apparent when I indicate the business activity that was engaged in in that period, for the purpose of effectuating the property's development, strata subdivision and sales of lots.

34 To anticipate what I have to say below, I reject R &amp; D Holdings' contention that, for the Bulletin Place land to be trading stock, it must first be shown that the Hallinn Trust carried on a business of trading in land in the sense of buying and selling land with some regularity or system. That contention is not supported by the language of s 70-10 and is inconsistent with the decision in St Hubert's Island (see esp per Jacobs J at 237-238 quoted below).

35 R &amp; D Holdings' submission is that, as the relevant business for which property is held for sale involves trading in subdivided land, an unsubdivided parcel will not be trading stock because it lacks marketability and there can be no market value.

36 To answer this submission it is necessary to refer in a little detail to case law on the definition of trading stock under the 1936 Act for such guidance as it provides in construing the 1997 Act .

37 Both sides accept that the seminal decision on whether land can be trading stock was the St Hubert's Island case, above. In that case the taxpayer company bought the whole of one small island and part of another for the purpose of developing and subdividing them and selling the allotments for residential purposes. It was incorporated with this purpose in mind. It procured an alteration in the land's zoning to permit the desired development. Substantial development works were carried out when the company was put into voluntary liquidation. The development works had not then been completed nor had places of subdivision been approved for any of the land. The liquidator was authorised to transfer and did transfer the land in specie to the sole contributory of the company who was then assessed for tax on the basis that the transfer was a disposal of trading stock to which s 36(1) of the 1936 Act applied. That issue was ultimately determined favourably to the Commissioner of Taxation in the High Court by a majority of three to two.

38 The issues of present relevance addressed by the Court were (1) whether the land in question was capable of being trading stock for the purposes of the 1936 Act and (2) whether it was trading stock in the business carried on by the taxpayer. The latter of these was raised by the express requirements of s 36(1) which dealt specifically with the question of disposal of trading stock.

39 Of the majority judges, Mason J noted that (i) it had become generally accepted that land may become trading stock according to the common understanding of this expression; and (ii) accountants and commercial men have recognised that raw materials used for the purpose of manufacture and partly manufactured goods could constitute trading stock. His Honour went on (at 228-229):
 
 "... as the definition of 'trading stock' contained in s 6(1) is not an exclusive definition, it requires us to give effect to the ordinary, and in this case that happens to be the commercial, meaning of the expression, notwithstanding that in part at least it is a meaning which may have derived from or may have been influenced by accounting principle or practice. 
 
 If trading stock according to its ordinary meaning denotes land as well as goods and commodities, it must follow that land may form part of the trading stock of a business before it has been converted into the condition in which it is intended to be sold. Just as raw materials and partly manufactured goods form part of the trading stock of a manufacturer, so also virgin land which has been acquired by a land developer for the purpose of improvement, subdivision and sale in the form of allotments will form part of his trading stock. 
 
 ... 
 
 Once it is accepted that land acquired for the purpose of improvement and development as a preliminary to sale in allotments in its improved form constitutes part of the trading stock of the land developer's business, notwithstanding that the land as acquired differed in condition from the land as intended to be sold, the issue in the present case is whether the land in question was acquired by the respondent taxpayer for its business as a land developer, that is, for improvement and development as a preliminary to sale in subdivided allotments. That substantial work remained to be undertaken in connexion with the land before it would achieve the condition in which it was intended to be sold as an immaterial consideration. It is enough that the respondent was carrying on the business of a land developer and that it acquired the land in the course of carrying on that business. The facts as outlined by the primary judge make it plain that the land was acquired by the respondent taxpayer for this very purpose."

40 His Honour later described (at 230-231) the developmental activity undertaken by the taxpayer and then commented (at 231):
 
 "The features to which I have referred stamp the enterprise with the characteristics of a business which had as its object the making of a profit from the ultimate disposition of the land in subdivided form. The land was acquired in 1960 in a series of transactions as the first step in a substantial business undertaking which was to endure for some years. Indeed, it was a long way from completion in 1972 though it is fair to say that the respondent encountered some difficulties which may not have been foreseen. The land was not acquired as an investment and its development for subdivision and sale was not simply the realization of a capital asset. In these circumstances it is impossible to treat the proposed enterprise as one which lacked the characteristics of a business and to say that it constituted no more than an isolated transaction capable on yielding assessable income under s 26(a) rather than s 25(1)."

41 The second majority judgment, that of Jacobs J, considered (at 234) land could be trading stock but that, for the purposes of s 36(1) of the 1936 Act , the property "must be an asset of a business of trading in that stock". His Honour went on (at 235):
 
 "Once it is concluded that land may be trading stock, then I can see no reason to limit the application of the words to land which is in the condition in which it is intended that it should be sold. I am inclined to the view that land acquired or purchased for purposes of sale falls within the words of the definition whether or not the land is in the condition in which it is proposed that it shall be sold. The definition does not say otherwise. But whether this be so or not, the definition is by way of extension, not limitation, of the ordinary meaning of the words 'trading stock'; and undeveloped and unsubdivided land acquired for the purpose of development, subdivision and sale is a stock of land in which the person acquiring it may be said to trade or to propose to trade. It may therefore properly be described as trading stock not only when the processes of development and subdivision have been carried out but also when it is acquired for the purpose of carrying out those processes upon it. Whether or not it will be held to be trading stock depends on whether the person carried on or had previously carried on the business of trading in that land."

42 Whether there was such a business in that case was answered thus (at 237):
 
 "Here there was what I think should be treated as a 'one-off' purchase of an area of land with an intention thereafter, as one continuous course of activity of which the purchase was the commencing act, to improve, develop, subdivide and sell in subdivided lots the area of land so purchased. Did the taxpayer thereby carry on the business of trading in that land? I have come to the conclusion that it did, and that the land became the trading stock of that business even though at the relevant time none of the land had been sold. The fact that none of the land had then been sold did not change the character of the business carried on or the character of the stock, the land, held as an asset with which it was intended to trade. 
 
 A contrary conclusion would appear to me to involve the proposition that a person can only carry on the business of trading if he does or intends to do repeated acts both of buying and of selling in the course of the business. Ordinarily to carry on the business of trading in a thing does involve repeated acts of buying and selling ... However, although this repetition of both buying and selling is a usual feature of trading I do not think that it is an essential feature." 
 

Acknowledging that a "one venture" can be a "trading operation", Jacobs J concluded (at 238):
 
 "Once it is recognized that land may be trading stock then an acquisition of land for the purpose of resale, after development improvement and subdivision, in subdivided lots, and a continued activity in fulfilment of that intention brought into existence a trading operation. The company was carrying on the business of trading so long as it was pursuing its activities with an intention to sell off the land in subdivided lots and the land was its trading stock so long as the intention continued."

43 Justice Murphy agreed with both Mason J and Jacobs J.

44 For the minority Stephen J, while accepting that land could be trading stock, concluded that the land in question was not trading stock because, at the time of its purchase it did not possess the character of being substantially in the state in which the taxpayer intended to trade in it. It was devoid of the characteristics of subdivided land. The emphasis on the time of purchase was necessary in his Honour's view because of the language of the s 6(1) definition of "trading stock".

45 Finally, Aicken J in dissent also accepted that land or interests in land could constitute trading stock but rejected that the taxpayer's land was such for the following reasons (at 246):
 
 "In my opinion items of property (including land) can only be regarded as trading stock in circumstances in which the business in which they are employed involves some continuity or repetition of both buying and selling, so that one is able to say in a real sense that the stock is being turned over by a process of buying and selling. 
 
 A single purchase of land, however substantial in area, made, not as part of a continuing business of trading in land, but none the less with a view to its subdivision and development into a residential area, individual allotments in which will be sold, does not seem to me to have the qualities required for answering the description of trading stock ..."

46 The significance of this case for present purposes is that it is authority for the propositions that (i) land acquired for the purpose of development, subdivision (or strata division) and sale by allotment (or lots) can constitute trading stock of a business having that purpose irrespective of whether the land has been so developed and subdivided; and (ii) that business will be carried on for so long as the taxpayer engaged in the effectuation of the purpose of development, etc of the land. The emphasis in St Hubert's Island on the need to have the relevant intention of sale at the time of acquisition of the property in question is, though, without significance for s 70-10 purposes which as I have earlier noted links the intention or purpose of sale with the purpose (or purposes) for which the property is held .

47 Despite St Hubert's Island , R &amp; D Holdings seeks to draw comfort from the following observations made in the five judge joint judgment in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 429:
 
 "The Act defines 'trading stock' in s 6(1) as including 'anything produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale or exchange, and also includes live stock'. The definition looks to the nature of goods that may constitute trading stock and posits that they will constitute trading stock if acquired for any of the specified purposes, including sale. It presupposes that the person by whom they are produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased is or will be engaged in trade in those goods. But it does not render an inquiry into whether or not the person is or will be engaged in that trade irrelevant. A single transaction does not render a person a trader, although, of course, a single transaction may constitute an adventure in the nature of trade. Nor, we think, is a single item acquired for the purpose of manufacture, sale or exchange an item of trading stock, unless the purchaser is or will be engaged in trading goods of that nature. Thus it is relevant to inquire whether the person who acquires an item claimed to be trading stock is a trader in the sense that he is engaged or will be engaged in trading goods of the nature of the item acquired."

48 The issue in John , insofar as presently relevant, was whether shares acquired by a partnership which carried on the business of trading in shares were trading stock within s 6(1) of the 1936 Act . They were found to be such. This context is important in considering whether their Honours were intending in any way to cast doubt upon the majority judgments in St Hubert's Island . In my respectful view, the above should not be taken as intended to address the quite particular and distinctive issues raised in cases of single venture land development and subdivision for purposes of sale by lots. The judgments of Mason J (who participated in the joint judgment in John ) and of Jacobs J in St Hubert contain a particular and detailed course of reasoning to bring what I will call single venture land subdivision cases within the scope of s 6(1). The observations in John as generalisations are, with respect, uncontroversial, but as generalisations suited to the general context exemplified in John . If they were intended to undermine St Hubert's Island in any way, I am of the view this would have been done explicitly, given the particular attention given to land in that case. In saying this I would draw particular attention to the comments of Jacobs J in St Hubert's Island quoted earlier rejecting the alleged need for repeated acts of buying and selling to establish "trading".

49 Though in this case, as in St Hubert's Island , the land together with such transformation as it underwent through development etc was stock in trade, the respective businesses carried on involved a purpose of sale of the transformed property, i.e. in the present matter the sale by lots of a strata subdivided building.

79 In the event then, I am satisfied that as at 30 June 1998 the Bulletin Place property was held for the purposes of sale in the ordinary course of business of the Hallinn Trust. That business was the development, strata subdivision and sale of subdivided lots of the Bulletin Place property: cf St Hubert's Island ; this being one of a number of business activities of the Hallinn Trust.

80 It may well have been the case that this particular business activity was abandoned not particularly long after 30 June 1998: see Mr Bobb's 13 August 1998 note referred to above. It is not necessary for me to decide whether and when this occurred for the purposes of this application.

81 The Bulletin Place property was held for the purpose of strata subdivision and sale of the subdivided lots. As such it was trading stock as defined in the 1997 Act as at 30 June 1998. The election to value it as strata subdivided at market value invoked the operations of ss 70- 45 and 70- 35 of that Act. The resultant net income of the Hallinn Trust calculated for the purposes of s 95 of the 1936 Act was included in the assessable income of R &amp; D Holdings. As the respondent does not contest that as at 30 June 1998 the market value of the land at 30 June 1998 was in the order of $29 million, the assessment for the 1998 tax year should be adjusted accordingly.</text>

<tocase>Barina Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 4 NSWLR 96</tocase>
<text>26 The second ("the lack of marketability") contention involves some examination of case law relating to land and in particular the decisions of the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 10 ; (1978) 138 CLR 210 and of Rogers J in Barina Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 4 NSWLR 96.

51 The principal authority relied upon in support of the applicant's "marketability" contention, is the decision of Rogers J in Barina Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation , above. In that case, Rogers J held that, for the purposes of s 31(1) of the 1936 Act (which related to the valuing of "each article of trading stock"), proposed lots in land acquired for the purposes of subdivision but which was not at that stage subdivided could not be described as "an article of trading stock" distinct from the land in globo. That is not the issue with which I am concerned in this matter. The relevant item of trading stock is the Bulletin Place land itself. As the Landsbury report indicates and as was relied upon by the trustees in making their election, that property was capable of being valued and was itself marketable. For this reason it is unnecessary for me to consider further the Barina case. It has no bearing on this matter.</text>

<text>47 Despite St Hubert's Island , R &amp; D Holdings seeks to draw comfort from the following observations made in the five judge joint judgment in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 429:
 
 "The Act defines 'trading stock' in s 6(1) as including 'anything produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale or exchange, and also includes live stock'. The definition looks to the nature of goods that may constitute trading stock and posits that they will constitute trading stock if acquired for any of the specified purposes, including sale.

Thus it is relevant to inquire whether the person who acquires an item claimed to be trading stock is a trader in the sense that he is engaged or will be engaged in trading goods of the nature of the item acquired."

48 The issue in John , insofar as presently relevant, was whether shares acquired by a partnership which carried on the business of trading in shares were trading stock within s 6(1) of the 1936 Act . They were found to be such. This context is important in considering whether their Honours were intending in any way to cast doubt upon the majority judgments in St Hubert's Island . In my respectful view, the above should not be taken as intended to address the quite particular and distinctive issues raised in cases of single venture land development and subdivision for purposes of sale by lots. The judgments of Mason J (who participated in the joint judgment in John ) and of Jacobs J in St Hubert contain a particular and detailed course of reasoning to bring what I will call single venture land subdivision cases within the scope of s 6(1). The observations in John as generalisations are, with respect, uncontroversial, but as generalisations suited to the general context exemplified in John . If they were intended to undermine St Hubert's Island in any way, I am of the view this would have been done explicitly, given the particular attention given to land in that case. In saying this I would draw particular attention to the comments of Jacobs J in St Hubert's Island quoted earlier rejecting the alleged need for repeated acts of buying and selling to establish "trading".

50 While I do not consider the quoted observations from John as being of relevance in this proceeding, there is one aspect of John which is of present assistance. It was indicated in the joint judgment (at 430) that the s 6(1) definition of "trading stock was predicated on the prescribed purpose (i.e. of manufacture, sale or exchange) attending the acquisition of the item in question". However, it was indicated that the definition did not require that the relevant purpose be the sole or dominant purpose". I can see no reason why a like view should not be taken to the like purpose requirement for which the relevant property is held in the s 70-10 definition of the 1997 Act . The significance of this for present purposes is that I have found below that R &amp; D Holdings held the Bulletin Place property at the relevant time for the dual profit making purposes of sale or lease of subdivided lots. These two purposes clearly are not "contrary or inconsistent": John at 430.</text>

<tocase>ARM Constructions Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 19 ATR 337</tocase>
<text>52 The final authority relied upon by the applicant ARM Constructions Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 19 ATR 337 - merely illustrates that whether or not property subdivided in a joint venture will be trading stock under the 1936 Act turned on the purpose or intention of the venturers when acquiring the property. If that purpose was retention, the lots etc subdivided and constructed would not be trading stock notwithstanding that the venturers acknowledged it might be necessary to sell some to discharge indebtedness as in fact happened. It does not assist R &amp; D Holdings in this matter given my findings as to the Trust's purposes in holding Bulletin Place in the 1998 tax year.

53 Mr Richardson gave considerable evidence oral and affidavit on this matter. I should state at the outset that I have treated his evidence with considerable circumspection. I am satisfied that both his evidence and the tendered documents for which he was responsible have on occasion been contrived or framed to advance R &amp; D Holdings' interests. Accordingly I place greater reliance on the contemporary record of events (other than several clearly self-serving R &amp; D Holdings documents to which I will refer specifically below).

54 The Hallinn Trust was, according to Mr Richardson, his family trust and it was his intention in relation to properties purchased by it that "they would be held, so far as practicable, as investment (sic) for the ultimate benefit of my children". His own affidavit, though, does suggest that there are other trusts associated with his "family interests" "the Austcorp 208 Unit Trust": Aff [14]-[15]; and "the A J Richardson Family Trust": Aff [128] though the provenance and character of these trusts is unexplained.</text>

<tocase>Kidston Goldmines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 77</tocase>
<text>102 Given what is said later in these reasons, the only comment I should make here is to reiterate the warning of Hill J in Kidston Goldmines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 77 at 85 that:
 
 "there is a danger in substituting for the words of ... subsection [51(1)] language which does not appear in it."

103 Put at its simplest, R &amp; D Holdings' case is that Chapel Road was entitled to claim deductions, pursuant to s 51(1) of the 1936 Act , in respect of interest due to MMLIC under the MMLIC loan on the basis that such interest was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income and, although it says it is unnecessary to show it, that it was also necessarily incurred in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. The basis of this claim is that:
 
 (a) in the years relevant to Chapel Road (1992 to 1997 income years inclusive) Chapel Road was the registered proprietor of the office building at 410 Chapel Road, Bankstown;
 (b) the building was a substantial multi level office building, parts of which were let to several different tenants;
 (c) throughout the 1992-1997 period Chapel Road was deriving rental income in respect of its ownership of the property;
 (d) that rental income was returned by it as assessable income for the purposes of its income tax returns;
 (e) Chapel Road continued to derive the rent as income notwithstanding that MMLIC had exercised its powers under the mortgage over the property to take possession in early 1991;
 (f) throughout the 1992-1997 period Chapel Road was incurring liabilities for interest due to MMLIC under the terms of the Loan Agreement dated 19 March 1990;
 (g) as legal liability for interest arose, such liabilities constituted outgoings incurred within the meaning of s 51(1) of the 1936 Act;
 (h) those outgoings were incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, and in carrying on business for the purpose of producing assessable income; 
 (i) the interest liabilities of Chapel Road were (in the same way as for any other "negatively geared" property investment) deductible to Chapel Road pursuant to s 51(1) of the 1936 Act.
 (j) in the 1992 to 1997 income years the quantum of the deductions exceeded the rental income derived by Chapel Road as a consequence of which it incurred losses pursuant to s 79E of the 1936 Act ; and 
 (k) in each of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 income years, Chapel Road transferred losses to the applicant in accordance with the requirements of s 80G of the 1936 Act (1997 year) or subdivision 170A of the 1997 Act (1998 and 1999 years).

104 In preparing and lodging its income tax returns in respect of the 1992 to 1997 years of income Chapel Road claimed other deductions arising in respect of its ownership of the office building. These were for:
 
(a) repairs and maintenance pursuant to s 53 and s 51(1) of the 1936 Act ;
 
(b) depreciation pursuant to s 54 of the 1936 Act ;
 
(c) capital allowances pursuant to Div 10D of the 1936 Act ;
 
(d) rates and taxes pursuant to s 72 of the 1936 Act ; and
(e) other miscellaneous expenses pursuant to s 51(1) of the 1936 Act .</text>

<text>117 There is a large body of authority to the effect that where borrowed money is laid out for the purposes of gaining assessable income this "furnishes the required connection between the interest paid upon it by the taxpayer and the income derived by [it] from its use": Ure v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 81 ATC 4100 at 4104; see generally Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro [1926] HCA 58 ; (1926) 38 CLR 153 at 170-171; Hart v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 222 ; (2002) 121 FCR 206 at [26] - [27] ; reversed by the High Court but not on this point: see [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216.

I would note in passing that the "incidental and relevant" formula is commonly used to describe the necessary connection between the loss or outgoing incurred and the gaining or producing of assessable income, though it has been acknowledged that the formula does not constitute "an exclusive or exhaustive test" of the scope of s 51(1) requirement: Lunney v Commissioner of Taxation [1958] HCA 5 ; (1958) 100 CLR 478 at 497.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1953/65.html</AustLII>
<text>119 When, for s 51(1) or s 8-1 purposes, an interest liability has been "incurred" on a loan the monies of which have been laid out for the purpose of gaining income, it will be characterised as a "loss" or "outgoing" not only if the liability has been discharged by payment but also if it has been capitalised, even if this results for the future in interest being payable on interest: see Hart v Commissioner of Taxation , above, at [23] ff. As was said in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v James Flood Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 65 ; (1953) 88 CLR 492 at 506:
 
 "The word 'outgoing' might suggest that there must be an actual disbursement. But partly because such an interpretation would produce very strange and anomalous results, and partly because of the use of the word 'incurred', the provision has been interpreted to cover outgoings to which the taxpayer is definitively committed in the year of income although there has been no actual disbursement."

120 Commonly, the more problematic question is when has a loss or outgoing been incurred or, to relate the question to s 51(1) and s 8-1, to what year of income is the loss or outgoing referable?

126 Alternatively, it could be said that the mortgage agreement so structured the interest liability that the taxpayer only "completely subjected itself to" the outgoings or losses in respect of interest month by month: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v James Flood Pty Ltd , above, at 506. Each monthly liability was "payable for its period": Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 at [146] .</text>

<tocase>New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 60 ; (1938) 61 CLR 179</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/60.html</AustLII>
<text>122 It is useful by way of introduction to begin with Dixon J's well worn statement on s 51(1) in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 60 ; (1938) 61 CLR 179 at 207:
 
 "To come within [the] provision there must be a loss or outgoing actually incurred. 'Incurred' does not mean only defrayed, discharged, or borne, but rather it includes encountered, run into or fallen upon. It is unsafe to attempt exhaustive definitions of a conception intended to have such a various or multifarious application. But it does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than impending, threatened, or expected."

123 Putting to one side the circumstances arising subsequent to the entry into the MMLIC loan (to which the respondent attributes decisive significance in negativing any connection between the excess interest and the gaining of assessable income), the terms of the interest liability assumed in the mortgage itself illuminate how the liability to pay interest should be characterised for s 51(1) purposes.

124 The mortgage contemplated that interest would be paid for the two year term of borrowing at either of two interest rates (depending on whether payments that were due were paid punctually or at all) unless the mortgage was terminated earlier by either the mortgagee or the mortgagor (by repaying the principal, etc in accordance with cl 7 of Annexure A to the mortgage). It could properly be said that at the time of entry into the mortgage, Chapel Road assumed a defeasible liability to pay the interest. But to say that all of the loss or outgoing attributable to the interest liability was then "incurred" for s 51(1) purposes would be to disregard how the mortgage itself contrived and structured the interest liability. It was (i) to be calculated on the daily balances of the principal sum or on such sum that remained outstanding; (ii) to be computed from the date on which the first advance was made; (iii) to be calculated and charged to the mortgagor on the last day of each month at the higher rate of interest, but be payable at the lower rate if the mortgagor made (inter alia) all payments due under the mortgage; and (iv) to be paid on the last day of each month; and (v) to be added to the principal on the last day of each month and bear interest thereafter.</text>

<text>72 The above is not the only evidence which throws light on the trustee's purpose in holding the property in the 1998 income year. It is this additional evidence that the respondent highlights in its submissions. In addition to the trustee's backdated "1995" minute, the Landsbury valuation and the financing correspondence of 6 and 27 November 1996, reliance is placed on the following. (a) On 16 November 1996 Mr Richardson sponsored an item in the Australian newspaper reporting the commencement of construction of the building as "the only new building specifically designed for the strata market ... in Sydney," undertaken in the course of his "turning his hand to strata subdivision of existing CBD office buildings". "[D]eveloping offices based on strata sales is a trend that has not emerged yet in Australia but is common in Hong Kong," and he "expects to begin marketing the 380 sq m floors in the new building next year." In cross-examination after attempting to minimise the import of his reference to strata designing the building, Mr Richardson accepted what this item clearly was designed to convey. (b) A press release approved by Mr Richardson on 16 December 1997 described the building as "built for its own niche market ... a specific sector where tenants want the individuality of their own floor". (c) On 10 May 1998 a Mr La Grouw of the Amstal Property Group Pty Ltd (a property marketing company) wrote to Mr Richardson setting out fee arrangements for sales or leases achieved of lots in the building. Mr Richardson struck out the portion concerning leasing, leaving the commission arrangements on sales intact, and initialled the letter. (d) On 12 May the selling agent, First Pacific Davies (NSW) Pty Ltd ("FPD") wrote to Mr La Grouw concerning an "information package for prospective purchasers" referring to the property as "strata office floors". (e) A glossy brochure advertising the property as being available "for sale or lease" was prepared and circulated in mid 1998 showing (despite Mr Richardson's denials in cross-examination) a Ms La Grouw as the agent for "sales". (f) In May 1998 the project manager convened a meeting to discuss an action plan for "implementation of coordination sales and leasing program". (g) In June 1988 a strata plan was prepared for lodgement with the Land Titles Office, although preliminary lodgement steps were not carried through to registration. (h) On 16 June 1998 Mr Richardson signed an exclusive agency agreement with FPD appointing it agent to achieve the sale of lots in the building. (i) The building was advertised in the print media in June 1998 "for sale or lease". (j) At mid-June 1998 the trustee's agent stated it was marketing the building for "sale or lease" and actively pursuing "strata sales prospects" in its "Half Yearly Update" prepared for the Trustee. (k) On 24 June FPD (with Mr Richardson's authority) wrote to a number of prospective purchasers offering inspection of the building which it described as a "Boutique Strata Office Building". (l) In the accounts of the trust estate for the year ended 30 June 1998 the property was shown as "land held for resale" at its market value, and distribution of $24,083,800 was made accordingly. (m) On 13 August 1998 Mr Bobb, the accountant, noted in a Hallinn Trust note that "Mr Richardson advised that the Bulletin Place property was not selling at a satisfactory rate. Accordingly the Hallinn Trust may need to retain the property for investment purposes. I advised the trust always has the right to convert any assets from trading stock to investment property".

73 It is unnecessary for me to make a finding as to Richardson Properties' particular purpose or purposes when acquiring the Bulletin Place Property and I decline to do so. I would only say that in the 1993 1995 period Mr Richardson intended to construct an office building on the composite Bulletin Place sites and I incline to the view that, consistent with other office developments in which Mr Richardson had been engaged (albeit through joint ventures), it was likely his then intent involved the multiple purposes (or "open" options) of sale and/or lease after construction because the options themselves were likely to be affected by the contingencies of interest rates, the economy and tenancy take up to use the trio to which Mr Richardson referred in his evidence.

74 Be that as it may, I am satisfied that from at least September 1996 when the Landsbury's valuation was sought, Mr Richardson (hence the trust) was committed to the strata subdivision of the property to be constructed with a view to strata sales. I reject Mr Richardson's explanation that the strata design in the valuation was adopted for the purposes of obtaining finance for the buildings construction insofar as he intended to convey that this was simply an expedient and reflected no change in his "investment" purpose. I consider his comments as reported in the Australian newspaper of 16 November 1996 about strata subdivision and his reasons for, experience in, and expectations of, it better reveal his contemporary purposes (being that of development, subdivision and sale).

75 Those purposes in turn were translated into the bases on which finance was sought from Westpac. Though the 6 November 1997 letter referred to the sale of only half of the building with the rest retained as a long term investment a statement of intent which could only have been made if great store was placed by Mr Richardson in the Landsbury valuation I am satisfied that sale of strata lots was Mr Richardson's dominant purpose.

76 I infer that the form of financing sought and the short repayment period for the Commercial Bills after drawdown (6 months) reflected his expectations of the marketability of the strata lots on completion of the building. As he said in concluding his 6 November 1996 application to Westpac formally seeking finance:
 
 "Given the current strong predictions of the market, it is an ideal time to commence this office building and bring it on the market early 1998. We will capitalise on the very high demand that should exist at that time."

127 It is, perhaps, unsurprising that in some number of decisions courts have assumed or have accepted that interest which accrues from day to day is so apportionable: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Guarantee Corporation Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 483; Commissioner of Taxation v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Workers' Compensation) Ltd [1999] FCA 351 ; (1999) 87 FCR 536 at 552; see also Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1940] HCA 9 ; (1940) 63 CLR 382 at 468 where the "recurrent expenditure" of interest to secure working capital was described as clearly deductible; see also in relation to recurrent expenditure, Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Ash [1938] HCA 68 ; (1938) 61 CLR 263 at 282.</text>

<text>140 The Deputy Commissioner's contention that there was no loss or outgoing is founded in part on the alleged "implicit assumption" in the cases that the deductibility of an outgoing in the year in which the obligation accrued is that it will in due course be met, i.e. that payment in the future is a certainty. This seeks to transform what may be a well-founded factual assumption in a given case as to what will happen in the future, into a legal prerequisite of deductibility. This, in my view, is how the respondent seeks to extract support from the comment of Ferguson J in Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Manufacturers' Mutual Insurance Ltd (1931) 31 SR (NSW) 575 at 585 relating to the deductibility of the calculated value of claims unmatured in the financial year in question, that "it is just as certain that some money will have to be paid". His Honour there was not concerned with, and was not addressing, whether the certainty of actual payment was a legal prerequisite to deductibility.</text>

<tocase>Oates v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 27 FCR 289</tocase>
<text>141 There is no such prerequisite. It is not an express requirement of s 51(1) or s 8- 1 . To insist upon it would introduce an unacceptable measure of uncertainty into these sections. It would require that the deductibility of losses could often turn on a fallible prophesy as to future events. And this would be so notwithstanding that deductions commonly have been allowable in respect of debts which were never later paid because of the onset of bankruptcy or liquidation: cf Oates v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 27 FCR 289 at 295.

142 The circumstances of this case, doubtless, provide an extreme example of inability to discharge a liability. But this does not assist the Deputy Commissioner. The articulation of the point at which an otherwise allowable deduction of a loss is to be transformed into a loss which is not allowable for the reasons relied upon by the Deputy Commissioner is obviously beset with no little difficulty. If it is to be the law that there is to be such a point, it is in my view the function of the legislature to identify it. It is not a matter for a court to add such a further and difficult implication and process of speculation into s 51(1) and s 8- 1 .</text>

<tocase>Macquarie Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 ; (2005) 146 FCR 77</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/205.html</AustLII>
<text>143 A distinct submission of the Deputy Commissioner is that the "excess interest" was of a capital nature and hence was expressly excluded from deductibility under s 51(1) and s 8- 1 . This submission appears to flow from the contention that the excess interest was not incidental and relevant to the derivation of any income of the company: (Respondent's Outline of Submissions pars 38-39). I have rejected the latter contention. I likewise reject the "capital nature" submission. Notwithstanding the financially disastrous position of Chapel Road given its circumstances and the terms of the loan, the interest outgoing was, and remained, "merely interest on a loan": cf Macquarie Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 ; (2005) 146 FCR 77 at [111] ; see generally Steele v Federal Commissioner of Taxation above, at 466-472.

144 My conclusion is, then, that in the relevant income years Chapel Road's monthly losses in respect of interest were allowable deductions.

145 The first of the three loss transfers was recouped by R &amp; D Holdings in the 1997 income year. That transfer was governed by the provisions of s 80G of the 1936 Act . In light of my conclusion that the rental liability was an allowable deduction, and because the other relevant requirements of the 1936 Act on loss transfers have been satisfied, it is unnecessary to set out the provisions of s 80G. R &amp; D Holdings was entitled to recoup the losses in question.</text>

<text>151 As to the requirement that there is in fact a "business" being carried on, it is sufficient for present purposes to note the following comments on what constitutes a "business" and the "carrying on of a business". In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at [54] , the majority observed:
 
 "A business is not a thing or things. It is a course of conduct carried on for the purpose of profit and involves notions of continuity and repetition of actions."</text>

<tocase>Evans v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 20 ATR 922</tocase>
<text>152 In Evans v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 20 ATR 922 at 939 Hill J commented:
 
 "The question of whether a particular activity constitutes a business is often a difficult one involving as it does questions of fact and degree. Although both parties referred me to comments made in decided cases, each of the cases depends upon its own facts and in the ultimate is unhelpful in the resolution of some other and different fact situation. 
 
 There is no one factor that is decisive of whether a particular activity constitutes a business. As Jessel MR said in the famous dictum in Ericsen v Last (1881) 8 QBD 414 at p 416: 
 
 
 
 'There is not, I think, any principle of law which lays down what carrying on trade is. There are a multitude of things which together make up the carrying on of trade.' 
 
 
 
 Profit motive (but see cf Inland Revenue Commissioners v Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (1888) 22 QBD 279), scale of activity, whether ordinary commercial principles are applied characteristic of the line of business in which the venture is carried on ( Inland Revenue Commissioners v Livingston (1927) 11 TC 538), repetition and a permanent character, continuity ( Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 9; Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 79 ATC 4261, 4264), and system ( Newton v Pyke (1908) 25 TLR 127) are all indicia to be considered as a whole, although the absence of any one will not necessarily result in the conclusion that no business is carried on."

168 I am satisfied that, from the time of MMLIC's entry into possession, a business involving the management and rental of the Chapel Road land and building continued to be carried on until the land was sold. There was a course of conduct engaged in by MMLIC through JLW which involved continuity, repetition and system. The indicia of a business being carried on was there: cf Evans v Federal Commissioner of Taxation , at 939. But who was carrying on that business?

169 Speaking colloquially, it could well be said that at least from when MMLIC went into possession and appointed JLW as its agent to manage the Chapel Road property, MMLIC was continuing to carry on "Chapel Road's business", the moreso as it was the legal owner of the principal asset of the business. This, though, would be a mischaracterisation of what in fact was occurring. And it would treat a business as a "thing", not a "course of conduct carried on".</text>

<text>163 There are significant gaps in the material before me concerning the activities engaged in, and the relationships created by, JLW. Though no agency agreement was put in evidence, I am prepared to infer that JLW was, and acted throughout as the agent of MMLIC as mortgagee in possession. There is nothing to suggest that JLW acted as agent of Chapel Road as a receiver and manager. Having demanded and accepted rents from the existing tenants, it may well be that the relationship of landlord and tenant was thus created between it and those tenants by attornment: Tymray Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance Co Ltd (1993) NSW Conv R 55-700; but cf Sykes and Walker, The Law of Securities , 248 ff (5 th ed, 1993).</text>

<tocase>Finn v London Bank of Australia (1898) 19 NSWR(L) 364</tocase>
<text>164 There is no direct evidence demonstrating that there were new lettings in the periods of present relevance although the case has been conducted on the assumption that there were. From at least JLW documentation from 1998, I am prepared to infer that new lettings were made on occasion. Consistent with JLW being the agent of MMLIC, I infer that MMLIC was constituted the landlord in such cases. I should add, given the express power to lease granted in the mortgage agreement, it is unnecessary to otherwise consider MMLIC's power to lease and the effect of the exercise of that power vis-&agrave;-vis Chapel Road: cf Finn v London Bank of Australia (1898) 19 NSWR(L) 364.

165 I am satisfied that at the time at which Chapel Road entered into the MMLIC refinancing loan it was then carrying on, and was intending to continue carrying on a business activity in respect of the ownership, leasing and operation of the Chapel Road property. That was, and was intended to remain, a commercially substantial operation having significant rental income and significant outgoings.</text>

<tocase>Mercantile Credits Ltd v Atkins (No 1) (1985) 9 ACLR 757</tocase>
<text>166 The mortgage Chapel Road entered into was of property on which an existing business was being conducted a business moreover for which that property has been developed. Even in the absence of the express mortgagee's power to carry on a business on the mortgaged property, I would in the circumstances have been prepared to imply a mortgagee's power to carry on the business being conducted at Chapel Road: cf Mercantile Credits Ltd v Atkins (No 1) (1985) 9 ACLR 757 at 762. The conduct of the rental business was, in my view, integral to the loan and its business efficacy.

167 A business of the type conducted by Chapel Road at the time of the mortgage continued to be conducted after MMLIC went into possession in 1991. I would observe in passing that it is unnecessary in this proceedings to determine by whom that business was conducted in the interregnum period after the s 63(1) notices were given and prior to JLW's appointment as MMLIC's manager.</text>

<text>170 Significantly MMLIC did not appoint a receiver and manager. If such had been the case, the receiver would have received the rents and managed the property as agent for the mortgagor: cf Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s 115(2) ; see also Visbord v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1943] HCA 4 ; (1943) 68 CLR 354; and would have been required to apply all money received by him in accordance with s 115(8) which includes (subcl (d)) "payment of the interest due and unpaid ... in respect of any principal money due under the mortgage": see generally Butt, Land Law , 18118 ff (5 th ed, 2006).

172 MMLIC was acting primarily for its own benefit. There was nothing fiduciary in the powers it was exercising. It was not acting as Chapel Road's agent: cf Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 26 ALR 307 at 319; see also Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Walker (1984) 2 FCR 283. It was not providing services to Chapel Road: National Bank of Australia v Sproule , above, at 510. If MMLIC's primary purpose in carrying on the business was, in all probability, to preserve the value of the property pending its sale, it nonetheless was conferring an incidental benefit on Chapel Road. It did not have a free hand in dealing with the rents received by its agent. It was constrained by the mortgage itself and by its position as mortgagee in possession. In reality its position differed little, in my view, from that of a receiver under the Conveyancing Act at least in respect of the application of the rents received. The rental income had to be accounted for to Chapel Road. What this meant in practical terms was, first, that it was to be applied in payment of outgoings. The net income was then to be applied "on account of some liability under the mortgage": cf Visbord v Federal Commissioner of Taxation at 370; and in the circumstances this was Chapel Road's monthly rental liability: see Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage , at 19.33, 39.24 ff; In re Morley's Estate; Hollenden v Morley [1937] Ch 491 at 496. The rental income never being in surplus over what was required for interest, MMLIC was never, and never likely to be, in the position of having to elect whether to apply it in reduction of the principal sum as such or to hand it over to Chapel Road because it did not wish the capital to be repaid by "driblets": Nelson v Booth (1858) 3 De G &amp; J 119 at 122. Put shortly, though MMLIC received the rents, the manner of their application was preordained by the mortgage and its legal consequences.</text>

<text>171 Rather MMLIC elected to go into possession itself and to receive the rents, to manage the property and to carry on the rental business itself, through its agent JLW. It can be inferred that it took this course for the purpose of preserving its security by enhancing the prospects of the building's sale as tenanted, i.e. as a "going concern". It is improbable in my view that having entered into possession, MMLIC would not have wished to carry on the business.

<tocase>American Leaf Blending Co Sdn. Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue [1979] AC 677</tocase>
<text>173 It is a question of fact whether or not, throughout the relevant test period, Chapel Road carried on a business at all let alone "the same business" as it may claim to have carried on immediately before the test time. In my view, it did not carry on a business at all in the relevant periods on the Chapel Road site. MMLIC did. Chapel Road had no access to business assets. I would add that while it could, in a sense, be said that Chapel Road's assets were being put to gainful use: cf American Leaf Blending Co Sdn. Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue [1979] AC 677 at 684; it was not Chapel Road that was doing this. It was MMLIC.

174 Accordingly I am satisfied that the same business test of s 165- 210 of the 1997 Act was not satisfied and, in consequence, that neither the losses claimed to be transferred in both the 1998 and 1999 income years were deductible to R &amp; D Holdings.

175 There is a seeming anomaly in this conclusion, especially given my earlier finding that the monthly interest liabilities were allowable deductions giving rise, in the circumstances, to significant tax losses. However, the conclusion itself, when considered in light of the "same business" test for loss transfer purposes, is the inexorable consequence of MMLIC having entered into possession as a mortgagee with all that that entailed.</text>

<tocase>Hart v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCAFC 105 ; (2003) 131 FCR 203</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/105.html</AustLII>
<text>180 Insofar as concerns the requirement of "recklessness", it is sufficient to refer to the observations of Hill and Hely JJ in Hart v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCAFC 105 ; (2003) 131 FCR 203 at [43] - [44] :
 
 "Recklessness is a concept well known to the law, particularly in the fields of tort and criminal law. In those fields, recklessness will usually be found to have been established if the person's conduct shows disregard of, or indifference to, consequences foreseeable by a reasonable person. In some contexts a subjective test is applied, but in others the test is objective. In BRK (Bris) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 46 ATR 347 at 364 Cooper J made the following observations in relation to recklessness in the context of s 226H: 
 
 
 
 Recklessness in this context means to include in a tax statement material upon which the Act or regulations are to operate, knowing that there is a real, as opposed to a fanciful risk, that the material may be incorrect, or be grossly indifferent as to whether or not the material is true and correct, and that a reasonable person in the position of the statement-maker would see there was a real risk that the Act and regulations may not operate correctly to lead to the assessment of the proper tax payable because of the content of the tax statement. So understood, the proscribed conduct is more than mere negligence and must amount to gross carelessness. 
 
 
 
 There is a line between recklessness and dishonesty, and as the Explanatory Memorandum for the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992 (Cth) (at p 89) confirms, a finding of dishonesty is not necessary for a taxpayer to be subject to a s 226H penalty. Wherever a tax return includes deductions that are not allowable, a foreseeable consequence is that there will be a tax shortfall, particularly in a system of self assessment. But, in the ordinary case, the mere fact that a tax return includes a deduction which is not allowable is not of itself sufficient to expose the taxpayer to a penalty. Negligence, at least must be established although there are some sections (e.g. s 226K) which impose a liability in particular circumstances even if the taxpayer has not been negligent. The context makes it clear that recklessness means something more than failure to exercise reasonable care (s 226G), but less than an intentional disregard of the Act (s 226J)."

181 The "not reasonably arguable" requirement of s 226K is elaborated in a definition in s 222C(1) of the 1936 Act . It provides:
 
 " 222C(1) [Regard to relevant authorities] For the purposes of this Part: 
 
 (a) the correctness of the treatment of the application of a law; or 
 
 (b) another matter; 
 
 Is reasonably arguable if, having regard to the relevant authorities and the matter in relation to which the law is applied or the other matter, it would be concluded that what is argued for is about as likely as not correct." 
 

The word "authority" is defined to include the relevant income tax Act, intrinsic material of which account can be taken in interpreting that Act, the decisions of a court, Tribunal or board of review and public rulings.</text>

<text>182 The above subsection was analysed in some detail by Hill J for the purposes of s 226K in Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1 at [105] ff. I will not reiterate what was said there other than to note that his Honour indicated that an argument could not be as likely as not correct if there was a failure on the part of the taxpayer to exercise reasonable care in making it, although reasonable care alone would not result in an argument being, objectively, "about as likely as not correct". I agree with this view. I would add that encompassed in what constitutes reasonable care in this context is the need for the taxpayer, or its advisers who are reasonably relied upon, positively to advert to the applicability of the law in question to the taxpayer's circumstances and actually to form a reasoned view on the matter.

183 The material before the court is slight which deals with the bases on which the taxpayer considered it could recoup in the 1998 and 1999 income years the tax losses purportedly assigned to it by Chapel Road. There is some evidence that Mr Richardson took advice from his own tax agents on the matter and that advice was taken from an external adviser. Though the advice related to whether Chapel Road's losses could be transferred to R &amp; D Holdings, the focus of that advice was on the question whether, because of its interest liability, Chapel Road had allowable deductions. It seems to have been assumed for the most part that if there were allowable deductions generating tax losses, these were transferable.

184 The only evidence put forward to indicate advice was given on the question of satisfying the conditions for a transfer of tax losses was contained in a facsimile from Mr Bobb, R &amp; D Holdings' accountant, to Mr Richardson in April 1996 prior to Mudipo's sale of its interest in R &amp; D Holdings. Mr Bobb noted that that sale would breach s 80A of the 1936 Act ("continuity of beneficial ownership"). He went on to indicate that R &amp; D Holdings would, nonetheless, continue to satisfy the "same business" test. And he then observed:
 
 "Compliance with section 80E must also apply to 410 Chapel Road Pty Ltd, after the transfer of shares from MPL to AJR in R&amp;D. We believe section 80E will not be breached by 410 Chapel Road Pty Ltd after the share transfer in R&amp;D. Therefore, we expect domestic revenue losses incurred by 410 Chapel Pty Ltd will still be capable of being transferred to R&amp;D."</text>
