<text>3 This matter has an exceptionally long history which some number of Judges both of this court and of the Supreme Court of South Australia have been obliged to narrate in detail. In my judgment in Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited) [2007] FCA 60 I set out a chronology at some length. I will not repeat it here other than to say that Mr Cirillo sought an inquiry as to damages in respect of an undertaking given when an injunction was awarded against him in 1985 restraining him from dealing with a particular piece of property described as "the Poclain". That injunction lapsed in February 1993 and the inquiry was sought in respect of that period. There were considerable interlocutory issues raised in that proceeding which, as I will later indicate, bear on the present matter. Suffice it to say that for present purposes in July 2000 a Master of the Supreme Court ordered the preliminary hearing of five issues from the apparently substantial number of issues that had arisen between the parties. Two of those issues were not prosecuted, the remaining three all were decided adversely to Mr Cirillo. A judge of the Supreme Court held, first, that he did not have standing to pursue his claim for relief in light of the events which had occurred; secondly, that he was not at any relevant time the legal or beneficial owner of the property in question nor did he have any right to possession of it; and, thirdly, he was estopped from asserting that he was a beneficial owner at any relevant time. His enquiry as to damages was dismissed. Mr Cirillo appealed unsuccessfully to the Full Court and a special leave application to the High Court was refused. The consent order founding the bankruptcy notice was made on 28 July 2005.

4 The applicant filed the present application on 11 July 2006. Counsel for the applicant has not read much of the affidavit filed in support of that application. It would appear that what was foreshadowed in it was an action in tort for abuse of process against four respondents plus their then solicitors, Finlaysons. The nature of that abuse has been said to be similar to that contained in a subsequent Federal Court proceeding to which I will refer to below.

5 The set aside application was heard and reserved by a Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court after a hearing over several days. Before the Registrar came to give judgment a further affidavit was filed by Mr Cirillo. Counsel for Mr Cirillo subsequently sought to have the hearing before the Registrar re-opened for the purpose of admitting that affidavit into evidence. By that stage Mr Cirillo had instituted proceedings in this court against the same five respondents. He purported to claim damages for breaches of duties of care he alleged were owed him by all respondents. While he characterised the conduct of the respondents as an abuse of process he did not plead that tort as such. The alleged wrongdoing of which complaint was made was concealment of an alleged agreement in 1997 by CAL in which it was supposed to have transferred secured debts owed to it by CWC to other corporate entities. The effect of this was said to be that CAL had in consequence not disclosed that it had no right to defend the inquiry as to damages proceedings at least on the basis that it had a set-off against Mr Cirillo's claims by virtue of its secured debt which was in turn supported by a personal guarantee by Mr Cirillo. Allied to this was a claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) against all of the respondents for damages for a contravention of s 52.</text>

<text>17 Equally, it does not appear that any order extending time was made under s 41(6A)(b). Mr Cirillo's application seems to be founded solely upon s 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act , his claim being that his tort action against the five respondents would satisfy the requirements of a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand for the purposes of that subsection. As I indicated in my judgment in the strike out proceedings, unless and until the costs order is set aside, it is simply not open to Mr Cirillo to make the claim he seeks to make founded on the tort of abuse of process claiming damages in respect of costs incurred in the inquiry as to damages proceeding. For this reason he cannot now point to an existing cross claim had by him that could be set-off against the costs order: Guss v Johnstone (2000) 171 ALR 598 at 607.

18 The present application properly characterised is a belated attempt to have time extended to institute proceedings to set aside the costs order rather than to set up a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand. This becomes immediately apparent once it is appreciated that if the costs order is set aside the judgment debt founding the bankruptcy notice would disappear. On this straightforward ground I would dismiss the application.

19 I would not, though, wish it to be thought that, even if this application could competently have been brought under s 41(7) , I would have the relevant level of satisfaction required to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</text>

<text>24 I equally should indicate that I have no material before me which could lead to the requisite satisfaction that the counter-claim etc on which Mr Cirillo intends to rely would, if quantified, be in a sum equal to or in excess of the amount of the costs order. There are simply bald assertions of sums of costs incurred by Mr Cirillo both in interlocutory proceedings and in the preliminary hearing. These are not the subject of any evidence that could satisfy me that he has any reasonable probability of recovery of such sums in his foreshadowed proceedings: see Patone v Asteron Ltd (formerly Royal and Sun Alliance Financial Services Ltd) (ACN 001 698 228) [2004] FCA 232 at [74] - [75] .

25 As to the alleged loss he incurred in unsuccessfully prosecuting the preliminary hearing it is difficult to see how this could be said to represent a recoverable loss in any event.

26 I have concluded that the present application is an incompetent one. Mr Cirillo cannot engage the power to extend time conferred by s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act insofar as he wishes so to do for the purposes of instituting proceedings to set aside the 2005 costs order of the Supreme Court of South Australia. Nor are the circumstances ones in which he can have the bankruptcy notice itself set aside under s 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act . Accordingly, I will order that the application be dismissed and I order the applicant to pay the respondents' costs of the application. 

 I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn J.
