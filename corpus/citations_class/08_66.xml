<tocase>Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/30.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at 18, Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ referred to injury in employment as a term which "covers injury of any compensable kind", and alteration to an employee's position to the employee's prejudice as:
 
 "... a broad additional category which covers not only legal injury but any adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee before the conduct in question."

23 Suspension from employment is an injury of a compensable kind. It is also an "affection of, or deterioration in, advantages enjoyed" before the suspension. Suspension can be a form of punishment and was most certainly a form of punishment meted out to Ms Eghnatios by AOS for being an alleged "trouble maker" and standing up for her workplace rights.</text>

<text>24 It is noteworthy that in Community &amp; Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 104 IR 195 at 199 the Full Court endorsed the view expressed in Squires v Flight Stewards Association of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155 at 164 by Ellicott J that an employee who was "stood down" on full pay for one month was injured in his employment because he was:
 
 "... treated substantially differently to the manner in which [an employee] is ordinarily treated and where that treatment can be seen to be injurious or prejudicial."</text>

<text>40 Employees also have the right to assist in the preparation and presentation of cases in courts of law and industrial tribunals designed to assert their legal rights without fear of thuggish retaliatory disciplinary action by an employer. The community should not tolerate the conduct which AOS engaged in with respect to Ms Eghnatios. The total penalty which should be imposed is $60,000. Having regard to the totality principle, it would not be appropriate to treble that amount to reflect the three prohibited reasons for which the offending conduct was taken. It is appropriate, however, for the Court to punish the two separate discriminatory overt acts of the transfer and the suspension of an individual employee. The total sentence reflects the totality principle as discussed by Jessup J in Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543 at 570-571; [145] to [146].

41 The Court makes the following orders:
 
 1. Pursuant to s 807(1)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ") a penalty of $60,000 is imposed on the respondent.
 2. The penalty is to be paid into Consolidated Revenue within 21 days of the date of this order.
 3. Pursuant to s 807(1)(b) of the Act , the respondent pay Ms Joanne Eghnatios, within 21 days of the date of this order, the sum of $6,668.97 by way of compensation for damage suffered by her as a result of contraventions of Div 4 of Pt 16 of the Act by the respondent.
