<text>7 In considering the Notice to Produce, it is necessary to bear in mind that it differs from a subpoena in that it is addressed to a party who will generally have a greater awareness of the issues, details and history of the matter than a stranger to the proceedings: see Trade Practices Commission v Australian Feather Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 26 FCR 555 at 557-8. By O 33 r 12 of the Federal Court Rules ("FCR"), a Notice to Produce has the same coercive effect as a subpoena issued under O 27 of the FCR: see Potts v Dennis James &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 770 at 779. Under O 27 r 3(4)(a), a subpoena must identify the document to be produced. The Notice to Produce also has the effect that in the event of non-production, secondary evidence can be given of the contents.</text>
