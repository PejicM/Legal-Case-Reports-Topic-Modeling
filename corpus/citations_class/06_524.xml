<text>11 In my opinion, the fact that the debtor always, on the outgoing and incoming passenger cards in evidence, gave his intended address in Australia as Ethersey House, which is his mother's residence, suggests that there is an available argument that he is able regularly to resort to that place as a residence within the meaning of the authorities. Of course, I can make no decision about the likelihood of the success of such an argument. Simply, having regard to the way the matter has been particularised, it seems to me that there is at least an arguable basis, and I put it no higher than that, that depending on the evidence ultimately advanced at the trial in support of and in answer to the particulars, the trial judge could find that the debtor either was ordinarily resident in Australia or had a dwelling house in Australia within the meaning of the authorities discussed by Graham J in Mathai v Kwee [2005] FCA 932 at [111] to [126].

12 For those reasons, I do not consider that there is any abuse of process or other basis upon which I should strike out the remaining allegations in paragraph 3 of the creditors petition.

13 The next issue is whether the subpoenas to the two clubs should be set aside. Each subpoena seeks in par 1 'application for membership with' the respective club. No name of any person is set out as to whose application it is, nor is there any relevant time period as to which such an application was to be made referrable. In my opinion, there is no legitimate basis for requiring that paragraph to be answered.</text>
