<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 [2006] HCA 53 ; (2006) 231 CLR 1</tocase>

<text>6 In the Court below the appellant advanced five grounds. Ground 1 contended that the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in so far as it made findings that were not open on the evidence before it. The appellant submitted that an applicant could not be expected to bring relevant evidence to prove his or her claim when leaving his or her country of origin. The appellant claimed that the Tribunal relied on country information provided by the country from which the appellant had escaped. The Federal Magistrate dismissed this ground. In doing so, the Federal Magistrate began by correctly observing that there exists no onus on the appellant to bring 'evidence in support of the circumstances for his departure from India': Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 [2006] HCA 53 ; (2006) 231 CLR 1 at [40] . The Federal Magistrate held that this was not the substance of the Tribunal's findings when the Tribunal said:
 The applicant has provided no additional evidence to support his claims at the hearing and in his protection visa application. He has no documentary evidence of his claimed membership of CPI(ML). He has no documentary evidence of his father's approach to the police following the applicant's claimed kidnapping by CPI(M) members. His account at the hearing of his claimed kidnapping was vague both as to its nature and timing. Based on the evidence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the kidnapping took place as claimed.

7 Whilst there is no onus on the appellant to produce evidence to the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrate correctly observed that 'it is for the applicant to advance evidence or argument that he wishes to be taken into consideration in support of his claim.' The Tribunal's findings were open to it. No jurisdictional error can be established on this issue.

8 Ground 2 contended that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to ask a question that it was required to ask. That was whether the Indian authorities provided a standard of protection that was comparable with international standards. The Federal Magistrate correctly dismissed this ground. The learned Federal Magistrate noted that the real issue was whether the Tribunal addressed the test with respect to the issue of State protection. After citing the relevant passage from the Tribunal's reasons that included advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ("DFAT") to the effect that State protection in India is generally provided to persons who feel persecuted due to political reasons, the Tribunal gave him an opportunity to respond to the DFAT advice. The appellant chose not to do so. The Tribunal found that Indian authorities provided adequate and effective State protection, and it was open to it to reach that conclusion. No jurisdictional error exists with respect to this issue.</text>

<text>10 In respect of the issue of any possible stress or intimidation faced by the appellant, the Federal Magistrate said at [22], '[t]he need to ensure that a person affected by the decision of the Tribunal is accorded procedural fairness will often require that they be plainly confronted with the matters which bear adversely on their credit or which brings their account into question: VFAB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 131 FCR 102 ; [2003] FCA 872. ' The Federal Magistrate correctly dismissed this ground.

11 Ground 4 essentially claimed that the Tribunal did not address the issue of the appellant being kidnapped by his political opponents. The Federal Magistrate cited the segment of the Tribunal's decision dealing with this issue, and correctly dismissed this ground.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>12 Ground 5 stated that the Tribunal, in making its determination, failed to record its decision in accordance with s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). The ground contended that the Tribunal failed to record certain findings. The Federal Magistrate cited Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 which considers s 430. Yusuf holds that all that s 430 obliges the Tribunal to do is 'set out its findings on those questions of fact which it considered to be material to the decision which it made and to the reasons it had for reaching that decision.' The learned Federal Magistrate correctly noted at [29] that 'there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal has not complied with this section of the Act. Contrary to the particulars given to this ground, the Tribunal did not find that the applicant had been persecuted and this was not for a Convention reason. Rather the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant had ever experienced persecution, and found that given the availability of state protection his claimed fears of future harm was not well founded.' Thus, no jurisdictional error can be established in respect of this ground.

13 In his written submissions, the appellant has raised new arguments which were not considered below and which were not specified in his notice of appeal.

14 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal failed to consider whether a liberal Muslim, as such, was at risk of harm from radical Hindus. The appellant did not raise this matter in the Court below. He would not ordinarily be permitted to raise it on appeal as the appeal is from the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate. The Federal Magistrate cannot be considered to have erred in failing to deal with a submission which was not advanced. I refuse leave for the submission to be advanced on appeal as it would be futile to do so. At the hearing before the Tribunal the appellant disavowed any claim to being a refugee based on his religion. He relied entirely on his and his father's political opinion.</text>
