<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] 225 ALR 266 at [30]</tocase>
<text>4 The relevant legal principles on legal professional privilege have recently been the subject of a comprehensive summary by Kenny J in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 266 at [30]. There is no dispute as to the correctness of this statement and I incorporate it by reference in these reasons.

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) 81 FCR 526</tocase>
<text>53 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) 81 FCR 526 at 559 Goldberg J said that the concept of anticipated proceedings involves 
 "the notion that there is a reasonable probability or likelihood that such proceedings will be commenced not that they will be but rather that more probably than not they will be."

55 The weight of authority now seems to favour the Mitsubishi "real prospect" test. If necessary, I would prefer that to the Safeway "more likely than not" test. However, for the reasons which will hereafter appear, I am satisfied that the higher standard has been met in the present case.

64 The law of legal professional privilege necessarily assumes that the privilege may, indeed usually will, arise before the actual commencement of litigation otherwise there would be no point in the concept of reasonable anticipation. Therefore, in applying that law to the ACCC it would be misleading to focus on the state of mind only of those who have the power to commence litigation on the Commission's behalf. Looking at the policy behind the law of legal professional privilege (cf the approach of Lord Hoffmann to the legislation in question in Meridian at 511), the protection needs to apply at a time when the prospect of litigation is less than certain (whether the Safeway or the Mitsubishi test applies). By this stage there is a need for frank and candid communication between client and lawyer, or other persons such as potential witnesses, on the subject matter of the litigation no less than there is when the litigation actually starts. The privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging full and frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [35] . The people who are supervising the actual work which generates the documents in question will not necessarily be the ones who can decide to commit the corporate body to litigation. However if, as matter of organisational reality, they are responsible for the work in question it will be appropriate to impute their state of mind to the corporation.</text>

In Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at [19] Batt JA, with the concurrence of other members of the Victorian Court of Appeal, held that there must be a "real prospect" of litigation, as a distinct from a mere possibility, but it does not have to be more likely than not. In Microsoft Corporation v Ben Zhong Fan [2003] FCA 1026 at [73] - [75] Jacobson J preferred the Mitsubishi view, as did Allsop J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 503 at [8] .

101 There was some complaint in the respondents' submissions of the "formulaic" assertion by Mr Alexander and Mr Williams of a dominant purpose. However, I note that in Microsoft at [77] there was criticism of a deponent who had used the adjective "primary". His Honour thought that it was "unsatisfactory that (the witness) has not spoken in the language of dominant purpose". Thus there may be something of a dilemma for witnesses swearing affidavits in support of privilege claims. Witnesses may feel they have to use either the formulaic term "dominant" or search around for some synonym a process which may be equally formulaic. In Grant v Downs at 678 Barwick CJ preferred the word "dominant" to describe the relevant purpose. In his Honour's opinion, neither "primary" nor "substantial' satisfied the true basis of the privilege. So it may be that the formula, however tedious, will continue to be used.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/66.html</AustLII>
<text>59 The respondents point out that ss 25 and 26 are to be contrasted. Section 25 does not authorise the Commission to delegate its statutory functions and powers to its own staff members. It may only delegate those functions and powers to a member of the Commission; see also the definition of "Commission" in s 4 which includes a member of the Commission or a Division of the Commission performing functions of the Commission. By referring to a member of the Commission or a Division of the Commission, the definition is referring to members to whom a power has been delegated under s 25 and a Division established under s 19: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd (No. 2) [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389 at [13] .

60 The respondents say that the Act has expressly regulated the extent to which the Commission may delegate the exercise of its powers and functions. Certain powers are expressly conferred on a member of the Commission, as opposed to the Commission acting in a meeting, e.g. issuing a notice under s 155. Otherwise the powers and functions vested in the Commission are intended to be exercised by members of the Commission acting in a meeting at which a quorum is present or through a Division established by s 19 , or through a member acting under a delegation under s 25.

61 The conclusion, the respondents submit, is that the Act contains a clear statutory indication that the Commission is not to delegate to one or more members of its staff the power to decide whether to institute proceedings under Pt VI. This is consistent with the Commission's published documents. For example, in a public statement in 2006 the Commission said:
 "Decisions to start court action, to approve or reject a major merger, or to authorise anti-competitive behaviour if it is shown to be in the public interest, are only made by the Commission."</text>

<text>63 The reasonable anticipation test is not a question of the exercise of some power by the Commission, such as the power to commence litigation. It is rather concerned with a state of mind which may or may not exist at a particular point in time. Only human beings can anticipate events. Whether the state of mind of a particular individual can be attributed to an incorporated body such as the ACCC depends on the particular law in question, in the present case the common law rules relating to legal professional privilege: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500 at 506-509. One does not look in this context for the "directing mind and will" of the ACCC: see Lord Hoffmann's explanation in Meridian at 509-511 of the sometimes misunderstood decision in Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705.

64 The law of legal professional privilege necessarily assumes that the privilege may, indeed usually will, arise before the actual commencement of litigation otherwise there would be no point in the concept of reasonable anticipation. Therefore, in applying that law to the ACCC it would be misleading to focus on the state of mind only of those who have the power to commence litigation on the Commission's behalf.

 "[A] document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, should be privileged and excluded from inspection."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1996/1031.html</AustLII>
<text>96 As to the name of the author, this complaint was made as to the ACCC's original list of documents dated 26 July 2006. The ACCC served a revised list on 27 November 2006 which included, as requested, information setting out "whether the statements were prepared by the ACCC or the AGS or counsel". The ACCC submits, and I accept, that it is not obliged to state the name of the author of each individual discovered document. No authority was cited for that proposition. The purpose of the requirement that a document be described is simply that the other party may know from the description whether or not it should be inspected and so that it can be identified subsequently: Australian Flight Test Services Pty Ltd v The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology [1996] FCA 1031 at 6-7. These requirements have been met in the present case. I note that the number of documents in question in this case is comparatively modest. The descriptions of them in the ACCC's list of documents suggest that the respondents would not be in any quandary as to whether or not to inspect. And they would have no lack of legal manpower to do so, if they were permitted.</text>

 "Documents which relate only to credit do not relate to a matter in question within the meaning of the traditional formulation."

107 Tamberlin J at [116] in agreeing with Beaumont J "strongly endorsed" the need for exercise of restraint in discovery. The judgment in Reading is binding on me.

108 In the present case, everyone knows that critical witnesses for the ACCC have been granted immunity. That fact can be, and no doubt will be, used by the respondents as a legitimate basis for an attack on credibility the witnesses. The effectiveness of such an attack cannot be predicted. However, documents which do no more than evidence that fact are relevant only to credit and are not discoverable.

109 On 8 January 2007 the respondents filed an amended defence to the ACCC's second further amended statement of claim. It included some new sub paragraphs to par 222. These were not introduced pursuant to leave. This is not a criticism, since the respondents had to plead to the ACCC's amended statement of claim. However the question of leave needs to be considered now. The new sub-paragraphs are as follows: 
 
 
 (aa) that in or about late January or February 1998 the Amcor Group formed the belief that it has a higher cost structure than Visy Board in its corrugated fibreboard packaging division and was significantly uncompetitive with the corrugated fibreboard packaging business conducted by Visy Board. 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 The Amcor Group's belief arose by reason of the fact that a former employee of Visy Board, John Alan Morriss (" Morriss "), provided the Amcor Group with, and the Amcor Group received, confidential information of Visy Board concerning Visy Board's CFP business, including a copy Visy Board's Managing Director's Report for the CFP Division dated June 1995 (" the 1995 Report "). The 1995 Report covered Visy Board's sales and included a detailed analysis of all major costs areas by month, year to date performance against budget, and the previous year. It included statistics on volumes, credit notes, employee numbers and conversion cost per unit of volume and per employee. Morriss provided extracts of the 1995 Report and other Visy Board confidential information relating to Visy Board's costs and sales figures in respect of the CFP business to Peter Brown of the Amcor Group 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
 
 (ab) that in or about November 1999, Morriss obtained a copy of the Visy Board Managing Director's Report CFP Division for October 1999 (" 1999 Report"), showed Brown, then the Managing Director of Amcor Australasia, the summary of the key financial data contained in the 1999 Report, and discussed the data with Brown. 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 The 1999 Report covered an analysis of volumes, employee numbers, costs and production statistics and profitability of each Visy Board Manufacturing plant for Visy Board's CFP business. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ac) that during the period of his employment with the Amcor Group (approximately January 1998 until January 2000), Morriss disclosed to Amcor Group personnel, including Brown and Hodgson, confidential information of Visy Board concerning customers, volumes of CFP products sold, and Visy Board's costs of producing CFP products. 
 
 (ad) that the Visy Board confidential information referred to in the particulars to paragraph 222(aa) and in paragraphs 222(ab) and (ac) above (" the Visy Confidential Information ") was used by the Amcor Group: 
 
 
 
 (i) to evaluate the relative efficiency of the Amcor Group's processes and costs in comparison with the corresponding processes and costs of Visy Board; 
 
 (ii) in the development of the Amcor Group's business strategies and plans to compete with Visy Board's CFP business, including as the basis of capital expenditure requests to the Board of Amcor Limited; and 
 
 (iii) to target Visy Board's customers. 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 (A) Morriss provided information in the 1995 Report to members of the Executive Management Team of Amcor's CFP business including Brown, Peter Reichler, David Ley, Tony Myles, Max Fitzgibbons, John Crawford, Hodgson and Laidlaw at an Amcor strategy meeting in March 1998 at which the relative CFP cost structures of Visy and Amcor were discussed. Jones, then the Managing Director of Amcor Limited, visited during the meeting and was briefed on strategy developments, including the significance of the information in the 1995 Report. 
 
 (B) Brown and Morriss from time to time during the Period of Service attended the Amcor Group's Camberwell offices to discuss issues about the CFP business with Jones. During these meetings, Morriss, Brown and Jones discussed the competitive position of the Amcor Group's CFP business and discussed information derived from the 1995 Report. 
 
 (C) Information derived from the 1995 Report was used by Morriss at Board meetings of Amcor Limited that occurred in 1998 during the course of which Morriss made presentations to the Board of Amcor Limited in the context of making capital expenditure requests to upgrade facilities at the Amcor Group's corrugated factory at Brooklyn. 
 
 (D) The Visy Confidential Information, or parts of it, were cited in presentations made to Jones, as Managing Director of Amcor Limited, to verify submissions as to the true competitive position of the Amcor Group and Visy Board, and in presentations made to Jones in support of additional injections of capital to fund a restructure of the corrugated fibreboard packaging division of the Amcor Group. These presentations were made by Brown, Morriss and others in or about the first half of 1988 and later by Hodgson to Brown and Jones at the Amcor Group's Rocklea offices in or about mid to late 1998. The presentation by Hodgson was made to support his request for a new corrugator and supporting infrastructure modernisation in order for the Amcor Group to compete more effectively with Visy Board's CFP business. 
 
 (E) The Amcor Group restructured its CFP business to reduce costs and pursued increased market share by a "breadth" strategy, including bundling CFP products with other primary packaging which Visy Board did not offer at the time. This was agreed at the March 1998 strategy planning meeting referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above and ultimately approved by the Board on Amcor Limited and implemented. 
 
 
 
 (ae) that despite incurring and continuing to incur significant expenditure aimed at regaining competitiveness in its CFP business, in or about late 1999 or early 2000 senior management of the Amcor Group, including Jones, Brown, and Hodgson, devised an alternative strategy, (described by the Amcor Group as "price recovery"), namely attempt to pursue collusive arrangements with Visy Board concerning prices and competition in respect of the supply of CFP; 
 
 (af) that the Amcor Group's attempts to pursue the collusive arrangements referred to in paragraph 222(ae) were unsuccessful."

110 Sub-pars (aa) to (ad) raise allegations far removed from the numerous serious issues of fact and law already present in this case. They have the potential of raising countless side issues as to the rights and wrongs of the conduct of Mr Morriss and the effect of that conduct on Amcor. Such evidence would be likely to be excluded as resulting in an undue waste of time: Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 135 (c).

111 Such pars (ae) and (af) stand on a different footing. The respondents put them as an alternative. In the end the respondents did not object to the provision of further particulars.

112 There will be orders as follows: 
 
 
 1. The first to fifth respondents' motions dated 5 December 2006 and 1 February 2007 are dismissed with costs.
 2. Subparagraphs 222 (aa) to (ad) of par 22 of the first to fifth respondents' amended defence filed 8 January 2007 are struck out.
 3. The first to fifth respondents file and serve further and better particulars of the allegations in par 222 (ae) and (af) of their amended defence by 27 April 2007
 4. The first to fifth respondents pay the applicant's costs of the motion dated 21 February 2007.
