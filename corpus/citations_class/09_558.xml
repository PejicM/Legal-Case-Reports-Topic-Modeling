<tocase>BRK (Bris) Pty Ltd v FCT [2001] FCA 164 ; (2001) ATC 4111</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/164.html</AustLII>
<text>In relation to recklessness in the context of s 226H, Cooper J observed in BRK (Bris) Pty Ltd v FCT [2001] FCA 164 ; (2001) ATC 4111 at 4129: 
 Recklessness means to include a tax statement material upon which the Act or regulations are to operate, knowing that there is a real, as opposed to a fanciful, risk that the material may be incorrect, or be grossly indifferent as to whether or not the material is true and correct, and that a reasonable person in the position of the statement-maker would see there was a real risk that the Act and the regulations may not operate correctly to lead to the assessment of the proper tax payable because of the content of the tax statement. So understood, the proscribed conduct is more than mere negligence and must amount to gross carelessness.

For the Commissioner, it was contended that recklessness was established by the following considerations: 
 34.1 the Applicant's signing of commercial documents without understanding the general effect that signing those documents would have; 

 
 34.2 the Applicant's acceptance of her husband's advice to take certain actions, without independent enquiry of the effect of those actions; 

 
 34.3 the applicant's accepting appointment as a director of a company which was trustee for a trust of which she was a beneficiary, the operations of which she professed little knowledge; 

 
 34.4 her swearing of affidavit material without personal knowledge of the factual matters contained therein; 

 
 34.5 vesting of trust assets of the Jancy Trust into a separate trust, without informing audit officers of that transaction.

I am not prepared to infer that the appellant was reckless for the purposes of the imposition of additional tax under s 226H having regard to these considerations.</text>

<tocase>Kajewski v FCT (2003) ATC 4375</tocase>
<text>The provisions of s 223 apply even if the appellant was ignorant of the accounting matters giving rise to the additional income of the Jancy Trust: Kajewski v FCT (2003) ATC 4375.

In my opinion, it is not competent for the Federal Court to conduct a merits review of the exercise of the discretion by the Commissioner to remit.

As my reasons at first instance indicate, the appellant was actively involved with Jancy Pty Ltd, the trustee of the Jancy Trust, of which she was the primary beneficiary. She had extensive involvement in the refinancing of property owned by Jancy Pty Ltd with the ANZ Bank.</text>

<tocase>Pearson v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 111</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/111.html</AustLII>
<text>On 5 July 2006, the Full Court of the Federal Court (Dowsett, Allsop and Edmonds JJ) allowed the appellant's appeals in part: Pearson v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 111.

In my reasons of 16 March 2005, I said, at [22]: 
 There is no dispute in these proceedings as to the Commissioner's power to issue amended assessments and his approach to the quantification of additional tax payable by the appellant, should his contentions concerning the income and the asserted disclaimers be accepted.

And, at [92], I said: 
 The parties are agreed that if I should find for the Commissioner in respect of the issues concerning the trust income of [Corplan Financial Network Unit Trust (CFNUT)] and [Corplan Financial Group Unit Trust (CFGUT)] in the relevant years and find against the appellant on the question of disclaimers, the monetary amounts should be as in the table annexed to these reasons.

The judgment of Edmonds J (with whom Dowsett and Allsop JJ agreed) said concerning this issue: On the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant accepted that [22] and [92] accurately reflect what his Honour was asked to do. He also accepted, although as it subsequently transpired he should not have, that no submission, written or oral, was put below as to the absence of a basis for recklessness and moreover, that he did not even draw his Honour's attention to the allegedly live question of additional tax. He said that the matter was raised as an issue in the initiating application to the Court, although it seems it was not raised as an issue in the statement of facts, issues and contentions filed by the parties as part of the interlocutory processes.
 If these were the only facts then, in my opinion, by the time the case came on for hearing before his Honour below, the issue of additional tax was no longer a live discrete issue; it may have remained an issue in name, but only on the basis that it stood or fell by reference to the outcome of the substantive issue.
 While, on the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant did not accept this view of the matter, he did accept that it would be more appropriately framed as an application for leave to agitate the issue rather than as a challenge to his Honour's disposition of the matter. I tend to agree and on those facts and concessions, I would not be prepared to grant leave.
 However, following the hearing of the appeal, papers, including transcript below, were filed with the Court which indicate that the factual basis of the imposition of additional tax, namely recklessness, was still an issue so far as the appellant was concerned, even if the respondent and the Court thought otherwise....</text>
