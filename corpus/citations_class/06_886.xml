<text>16 The serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may be taken into account in determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice for leave to be granted in a case of this kind. However, the authorities reveal that leave is less likely to be granted where the appellant has been legally represented at all times ( Wimalaratne v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1737 (FC); Iyer v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 (FC)).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The reasons for decision of the Tribunal should not be scrutinised over-zealously ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 272). It is not entirely clear what the Tribunal meant by the expression 'Serbian forces' . However, when the reasons for decision of the Tribunal are read as a whole, I do not consider that they suggest that the Tribunal misunderstood the independent evidence to which it referred. The Tribunal rightly looked to that evidence to see what light, if any, it threw on the question of whether the appellant had a real chance of being harmed by Serbian authorities should he return to his country of nationality. I think it likely that the Tribunal intended to convey that the exclusively Serbian military forces which the appellant feared were no longer responsible for maintaining order in Preshevo; for that reason the appellant would be able to look to the multi-ethnic police force for protection. This view of the situation in Preshevo finds support in the independent evidence to which the Tribunal referred.

24 The independent evidence to which the Tribunal referred was fairly characterised by it as revealing that the situation in Preshevo has changed and that ethnic Albanians are no longer oppressed by Serbians. For example, the primary decision-maker noted that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had advised:
 
 '... the FRY Government has endeavoured to redress Albanian grievances in Presevo. Albanians are included in administrative and political structures including in a new multi-ethnic police force. Municipal elections in July 2002 returned Albanian mayors in two out of three municipalities. There is considerable international presence in Presevo, which keeps the actions of the authorities under scrutiny. In short, there is no reason for Albanians from Presevo to fear returning unless, of course, they have committed some genuine criminal offence.'

25 I conclude that this proposed ground of appeal has limited prospects of success.</text>

<tocase>NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51</tocase>

<text>15 An appellant requires the appellate court's leave to rely on arguments not advanced before the court below. That leave will only be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice for the leave to be granted ( NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 esp at [163]-[166]). In NAJT at [166] Madgwick J identified the relevant questions as including the following:
 
 '1) Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success? 
 
 
 2) Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below? 
 3) How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved? 
 4) What is at stake in the case for the appellant? 
 5) Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand? 
 6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent? 
 7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured? 
 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie?'</text>
