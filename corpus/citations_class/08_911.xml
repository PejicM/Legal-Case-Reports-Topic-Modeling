<text>32 Three months after NAOA [2004] FCAFC 241 was decided, the High Court decided Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 where at 10-15 [28]-[41] McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ analysed the course of a hearing before the tribunal based solely on the decision record. They noted ( NAFF 221 CLR at 10 [28] and see too at 5 [9]) that without access either to the tape recording or transcript of the hearing before the tribunal it was not easy for the Court to appreciate the detail of everything that happened at the hearing. I consider that the Full Court in NAOA [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case. As is clear from NAFF [2004] HCA 62 ; 221 CLR 1 , the tribunal's decision record alone is evidence of what happened at the hearing.</text>

<text>53 The function of a court is to discern whether the tribunal has arrived at its decision on the merits by a procedure authorised by, and in conformity with, the enactment which conferred the power: Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 95-96 [14] - [16] ; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [37] - [41] per myself.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The Minister's argument conflated the weight which may be given to evidence capable of proving a fact with the ultimate fact sought to be proved by that evidence. As Dixon J pointed out in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 363, the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which the tribunal of fact can attain a reasonable satisfaction of the occurrence of an event. He said reasonable satisfaction was not a state of mind that was attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved: Briginshaw 60 CLR at 362. This reflects s 140 of the Evidence Act : see also Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 479-482 [29] - [38] per Weinberg and Bennett JJ and myself. Thus, in Rejfek v McElroy (1965) 112 CLR 517 at 521-522 Barwick CJ, Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Windeyer JJ said that no matter how grave the fact which was to be found in a civil case, the mind had only to be reasonably satisfied and had not, with respect to any matter in issue in such a proceeding, to attain that degree of certainty which is indispensable to the support of a conviction on a criminal charge.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 (2007) 163 FCR 285</tocase>
<text>61 This does not mean that the tribunal has to identify to the applicant for review the significance of the questions it puts or the ultimate issue to which the questions go, as Emmett, Weinberg and Lander JJ held in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 (2007) 163 FCR 285 at 302 [87]-[89]. Nor does the tribunal need to give a running commentary on its thought processes. Nonetheless the tribunal must ensure that it identifies to the applicant for review the issues arising in relation to the review, in accordance with s 425(1) and gives him or her a real opportunity to give evidence and to present arguments on them. I am of opinion that the tribunal did not do so in respect of the issues under s 91R(3) and what it expected the appellant ought to have known based on her attendances at the Local Church in Australia.

62 I am grateful for the assistance I received from counsel for the parties and, in particular, for the willingness of counsel to act for the appellant pursuant to Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules .

63 The appeal should be allowed.

 I certify that the preceding sixty-three (63) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/241.html</AustLII>
<text>31 After I reserved judgment, the Minister referred to what Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ said in NAOA v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] . They observed that it had not been open for the trial judge, on the evidence of the tribunal's decision record alone, to have made a finding that a matter had not been raised with the applicant at the hearing before the tribunal. They noted there that there was no transcript or affidavit before the trial judge as to what had occurred at the hearing.

32 Three months after NAOA [2004] FCAFC 241 was decided, the High Court decided Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 where at 10-15 [28]-[41] McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ analysed the course of a hearing before the tribunal based solely on the decision record.

<tocase>NBKT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/195.html</AustLII>
<text>50 It is implicit in the reasoning of the tribunal that such knowledge of Christianity and the Local Church, as the appellant had, was obtained in Australia to strengthen her claim to be a refugee: cf s 91R(3) of the Act. That flows from its rejections of her claim to have been a member of the Local Church in China and, based on s 91R(3), the genuineness of her attendances at the Sydney Church. Yet there is nothing in the tribunal's statement of decision and reasons which indicates that it put the appellant on notice that she had not had that knowledge before arriving here. Nor did it make such a finding expressly. There may be other limitations on the tribunal's use of s 91R(3) in relation to a person's religious belief as suggested by Young J, with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed in NBKT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 442-443 [91] - [97] , but these do not arise here.

51 The tribunal said that it had applied s 91R(3) of the Act to disregard the appellant's conduct in attending the Local Church here. Yet it accepted that the appellant had been able to provide details of Christian belief and of Local Church beliefs and practices. Those details were not criticised by the tribunal and appear to have been accurate, so far as they were sought. The appellant did not appear to be making a claim based on her conduct in Australia. Certainly, she did not do so in her application for a protection visa. Nor did the delegate consider such a claim. The tribunal did not recite such a claim, although it noted her evidence of her attendance at the Local Church in Blacktown.</text>

<tocase>Rejfek v McElroy (1965) 112 CLR 517</tocase>
<text>34 The Minister's argument conflated the weight which may be given to evidence capable of proving a fact with the ultimate fact sought to be proved by that evidence. As Dixon J pointed out in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 363, the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which the tribunal of fact can attain a reasonable satisfaction of the occurrence of an event. He said reasonable satisfaction was not a state of mind that was attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved: Briginshaw 60 CLR at 362. This reflects s 140 of the Evidence Act : see also Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 479-482 [29] - [38] per Weinberg and Bennett JJ and myself. Thus, in Rejfek v McElroy (1965) 112 CLR 517 at 521-522 Barwick CJ, Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Windeyer JJ said that no matter how grave the fact which was to be found in a civil case, the mind had only to be reasonably satisfied and had not, with respect to any matter in issue in such a proceeding, to attain that degree of certainty which is indispensable to the support of a conviction on a criminal charge.</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>20 His Honour concluded that the principles discussed by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 did not assist the appellant because she was 'clearly put on notice by the delegate's decision and the s 424A letter that the truth of her whole narrative was in issue' ( SZJYA [2007] FMCA 613 at [22] ). His Honour dismissed her argument that the tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A.

23 The appellant argued that:
 
 
 &#8226; his Honour erred in holding that it was not illogical, capricious or perverse for the tribunal to accept that in Australia the appellant had acquired knowledge of the Local Church and attended its meetings while concluding that she had not engaged in its activities in China as she claimed;
 &#8226; the tribunal failed to accord her procedural fairness in accordance with s 425 of the Act. The appellant argued that the delegate's decision had not identified or involved any finding that she had acquired knowledge of the Local Church and attended meetings only in Australia. Indeed, it would have been very difficult for the delegate to have made such a finding since the application for a protection visa was made within six weeks of her arrival her and did not refer to any involvement she had with the Local Church in Australia. That local involvement appears to have arisen at the end of the tribunal hearing (based on its recitation in its statement for decision and reasons of what happened then) and the tribunal's investigation of the letter dated 8 October 2006 from the Local Church;
 &#8226; the delegate had found that she had had a low key role within the Local Church in China and that the tribunal had not referred to this as an issue arising in relation to the decision under review for the purposes of s 425(1) of the Act, as explained in SZBEL 228 CLR at 162-164 [33]-[40] per Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. In effect, the appellant argued that she had not been informed that an issue arising on the review was that she had fabricated her association with the Local Church by attending meetings in Australia and gaining her knowledge of Christian beliefs and practices solely in the short period in which she was in this country, in particular the period between lodging her application and its refusal by the delegate. In this regard, she relied on the formulation that I had considered to be arguable when granting leave to appeal ( SZJYA [2007] FCA 1168 at [12] .

24 In SZBEL 228 CLR at 164 [38] the Court said that it was important to identify the issues arising in relation to the delegate's decision which was under review. Those issues determine whether rejection by the tribunal of critical aspects of an applicant's account of events was obviously open on the known material.

25 The Minister argued that it followed from the Court's reasons in SZBEL 228 CLR at 164-166 [39]-[49] that the delegate had rejected the appellant's account on the basis that there was no evidence to support her claims. Thus, he argued that the delegate could not accept her credibility and this finding put her on notice that the whole of her claim was in issue on the review. The Minister particularly relied upon what the Court had said in SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [43]. Their Honours held that nothing in the delegate's reasons for decision in that case indicated that two identified aspects of SZBEL's account were in issue. Nor had the tribunal in that case identified those aspects of his account as important issues. In that case the delegate had not based his decision on those two matters. Prior to giving its decision, the tribunal had not challenged what SZBEL had said on the two matters, so that he was not alerted to them being live issues in the tribunal's decision against him.

26 The Minister argued that, based on the delegate's decision, the appellant here was on notice that her whole credibility and account were in issue.

27 Here, the tribunal dealt with an issue which was not before the delegate concerning the genuineness of the appellant's beliefs and current practising. It found that it did not accept that 'she is currently a genuine practitioner' and referred to s 91R(3) of the Act.

28 In SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [47] the Court noted that there may well be many cases, where either the delegate's decision or the tribunal's statements or questions during a hearing sufficiently indicate to an applicant for review that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue. They said that that indication could be given in many ways. If there were specific aspects of an applicant for review's account that the tribunal considered may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt, it had at least to ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and to explain why it should be accepted.

29 The Minister argued that because there was no transcript or affidavit evidence of what happened in the hearing before the tribunal, it was impossible to find on the material before me that the tribunal had not asked the appellant to expand upon the aspects of her account concerning her belief and practice of Christianity both in China and here, and to explain why it should be accepted. He argued that the fact that, after the hearing, the appellant had seen fit to provide the tribunal with the letter from the Local Church in Sydney showed that she was on notice that this was an issue. And, the Minister argued that whatever might be contained in the tribunal's statement of decision and reasons, it was not obliged to set out the full course of the hearing, but only to perform the duty imposed by s 430(1). Accordingly, he argued that it ought not be found that the tribunal's recital of so much of the hearing as appears in its statement of reasons and decision was full and complete.

30 The Minister submitted that where, as here, a party argues that something did not happen, namely that the appellant was not put on notice that the genuineness of her belief in Christianity was in issue, the only way that lack of notice could be proved was by tendering what actually happened at the hearing through either the transcript, a tape recording or an affidavit. He said that, absent such evidence, it would be mere speculation to conclude that the fact asserted by the appellant here had been proved.

38 As the Court pointed out in SZBEL 228 CLR at 160 [25], what is required by procedural fairness is a fair hearing, not a fair outcome. The trial judge said that the appellant had clearly been put on notice by the delegate's decision in the s 424A letter that the truth of her whole narrative was in issue. I do not agree that that is so or that it was sufficient. First, in SZILQ 163 FCR at 316 [33] Buchanan J observed, correctly, that it is an essential premise of s 91R(3) that an applicant for review have a proper opportunity to satisfy the tribunal (or the Minister or a delegate) that the conduct in Australia which is said to be relevant was not engaged in just for the purpose of strengthening his or her claim to be a refugee.

44 In SZBEL 228 CLR at 163 [36], the Court said that in the ordinary situation of an applicant attending a hearing before the tribunal following an invitation under s 425(1):
 
 '... unless the Tribunal tells the applicant something different, the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision.'

45 Here, the appellant was found by the tribunal to be '... able to provide details of Christian belief and of Local Church beliefs and practices ...'. The tribunal said that her reasoning for becoming a member and leading a group to prevent smoking was not credible. It added that, '... [i]n addition she was unable to provide details of the Local Church which the Tribunal would expect would be known by someone who had genuinely been a member since March 2005, including approximately six months practice in Australia' (emphasis added).

46 Next the tribunal referred to the appellant's evidence and subsequent response to the s 424A letter. It noted that she had said, both at the hearing and in the response to the s 424A letter, that the Local Church did not mix with the Chinese registered church. In evidence she had told the tribunal, however, that the Local Church accepted other churches, whereas country information was to the contrary. The tribunal considered this was an issue for it.

54 The tribunal was required, by s 430(1)(d) of the Act, to refer in its statement '... to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based'. The tribunal gave a number of reasons stating that it found shortcomings and implausibilities in the appellant's knowledge of some Local Church doctrines. But, the delegate had not based his or her decision on this aspect or on the suggested Australian acquisition of knowledge by the appellant: cf SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [45]. I agree with Buchanan J who observed in SZILQ 163 FCR at 316 [33] that it is an essential premise of s 91R(3) that the applicant for review have a proper opportunity to satisfy the tribunal (or decision-maker) of the matters with which that section deals.

57 The appellant had no opportunity to give evidence or to make submissions, in accordance with s 425(1), that she had not just learnt what she knew about Christianity and the Local Church since arriving here. That was a denial of procedural fairness: SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [44].

58 The tribunal's statement of its decision and reasons indicated that it asked the appellant about basic Christian doctrine as well as doctrines of the Local Church. The tribunal questioned the appellant as to her selection of the Local Church as opposed to some other denomination. Although it did not have an obligation to set out everything that occurred at the hearing, I infer from the detail of its recitation of the questioning and answers at the hearing that it had set out the substance of all of the matters which it regarded as having significance to its function of conducting a review. While there is no transcript in evidence, nonetheless I am satisfied, in accordance with s 140 of the Evidence Act , that the tribunal did not ask the appellant why her account of being a Christian should be rejected: SZBEL 228 CLR at 166 [47].

59 There is nothing in the tribunal's account of what occurred at the hearing to suggest that the appellant had been put on notice that the genuineness of her Australian participation in the Local Church's activities was in issue, as opposed to the level at which she claimed she participated. The tribunal did not record that the appellant had made any claim that her attendance at the Local Church in Sydney or religious practice in Australia supported her claim for a refugee visa. The tribunal said it disregarded this conduct, in assessing her case as required by s 91R(3). But instead of disregarding the conduct it used this conduct to find against the appellant. The tribunal's only investigation of what the appellant did in Australia in relation to the Local Church was to confirm the content of the letter concerning her attendance. It then speculated about the inability of the appellant to provide '... details of the Local Church which the Tribunal would expect would be known by someone who had genuinely been a member since March 2005, including approximately six months practice in Australia' (emphasis added). This was one of the matters it stated had led it to conclude that she was not credible and had not become a member of the Local Church. Yet the tribunal's decision record does not record any account of the appellant being questioned about practice in Australia except simply in relation to her attendance at the Blacktown Local Church.

60 In SZBEL 228 CLR at 166 [47] the Court said:
 
 'But where, as here, there are specific aspects of an applicant's account, that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt , the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted.'

<tocase>SZILQ v Minister for Immigration (2007) 163 FCR 304</tocase>
<text>36 The appellant argued that the tribunal's reasons do not suggest that she had been invited to give evidence or present arguments as to whether she had engaged in attending the Local Church in Australia either for the purposes of bolstering her claim for a protection visa or as going to her credibility generally. She relied on what Buchanan J had held in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration (2007) 163 FCR 304 at 315-316 [32]-[33]

37 The Minister argued that the tribunal's recitation of what had occurred at the hearing in the course of questioning the appellant put her on notice that her account generally was implausible. He argued that the inference from this material was that she was aware that her membership of the Local Church here was in issue. The Minister also argued that SZILQ 163 FCR at 315 [31] supported his submission that the tribunal did not have an obligation to put to the appellant that it would make a finding against her under s 91R(3), because that section placed the onus on the appellant of satisfying the tribunal that conduct engaged in in Australia was not done for the purposes of supporting the claim to a protection visa.

38 As the Court pointed out in SZBEL 228 CLR at 160 [25], what is required by procedural fairness is a fair hearing, not a fair outcome. The trial judge said that the appellant had clearly been put on notice by the delegate's decision in the s 424A letter that the truth of her whole narrative was in issue. I do not agree that that is so or that it was sufficient. First, in SZILQ 163 FCR at 316 [33] Buchanan J observed, correctly, that it is an essential premise of s 91R(3) that an applicant for review have a proper opportunity to satisfy the tribunal (or the Minister or a delegate) that the conduct in Australia which is said to be relevant was not engaged in just for the purpose of strengthening his or her claim to be a refugee.

54 The tribunal was required, by s 430(1)(d) of the Act, to refer in its statement '... to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based'. The tribunal gave a number of reasons stating that it found shortcomings and implausibilities in the appellant's knowledge of some Local Church doctrines. But, the delegate had not based his or her decision on this aspect or on the suggested Australian acquisition of knowledge by the appellant: cf SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [45]. I agree with Buchanan J who observed in SZILQ 163 FCR at 316 [33] that it is an essential premise of s 91R(3) that the applicant for review have a proper opportunity to satisfy the tribunal (or decision-maker) of the matters with which that section deals.</text>

<text>56 But moreover, it found, as a fact that '... it does not accept that she is currently a genuine practitioner' (my emphasis). There is nothing in her claim for a protection visa, the delegate's decision, or in the tribunal's statement of decision and reasons which put the appellant on notice before the tribunal's decision was made that the appellant had engaged in conduct here to strengthen her claim and that such conduct, went to her credibility. Nor could the s 424A letter that was sent after the hearing raise any new issue so as to satisfy the requirement in s 425(1) that the tribunal invite the applicant for review to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review: SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 at [59] per Besanko J.</text>

<text>1 The appellant is citizen of the People's Republic of China. She arrived in Australia on 2 April 2006. In mid-May 2006 she applied for a protection visa with the assistance of a migration agent. A delegate of the Minister refused her application on 4 August 2006. She applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal to review the delegate's decision. It affirmed the decision of the delegate. The Federal Magistrates Court refused her claim for constitutional writ relief on the basis that it was not satisfied she had an arguable case. I granted the appellant leave to appeal from that decision ( SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1168). Subsequently, the matter was fully argued on the hearing of the appeal.

2 The appellant made a statutory declaration detailing her claims. She submitted it with her visa application. She was 22 years old. She claimed that she had faced persecution by the Chinese authorities because she was a Christian, and a member of the Local Church which was regarded as an anti-government, illegal Christian church. Two years before coming here, she had graduated from a senior high school in Fujian Province. Following her graduation, her elder brother invited her to assist him in his food shop on the outskirts of Guiyang, the capital of Guizou Province, a considerable distance from her home. She went to Guiyang in August 2002.

3 Her brother's shop was close to a village in which most of the local people were members of a particular ethnic group. The appellant claimed that most of the local villagers relied on growing tobacco and supplying it to a large State owned tobacco factory in Guiyang. She claimed to have been concerned about the numbers of the local ethnic group who smoked, including children who were starting to do so at about age 10. She claimed to have been concerned that the local authorities did not have any policies or take any steps to deal with this serious social problem, particularly in relation to young children smoking.

18 The trial judge identified that one ground of the amended application before him was that the appellant was a genuine member of the Local Church. He said that this was no more than an argument going to the merits of the tribunal's assessment. He said it was 'not illogical, capricious or perverse' for the tribunal to accept that the appellant had acquired, in Australia, knowledge of the Local Church and attended its meetings, while not accepting her claims to have engaged in Local Church activities in China ( SZJYA v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 613 at [18] ).

19 Next his Honour identified another ground raised by the appellant before him as, in substance, that she had been misled by the tribunal into believing that her claims had already been accepted and well-understood. He pointed out that there was no transcript of the hearing before the tribunal or affidavit evidence to show that that had happened. His Honour found that there was nothing before him, including the tribunal's description of the hearing, which gave that ground any substance, and pointed to the fact that the s 424A letter drew attention to the question of the appellant's credibility as a whole ( SZJYA [2007] FMCA 613 at [21] ).

20 His Honour concluded that the principles discussed by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 did not assist the appellant because she was 'clearly put on notice by the delegate's decision and the s 424A letter that the truth of her whole narrative was in issue' ( SZJYA [2007] FMCA 613 at [22] ). His Honour dismissed her argument that the tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A.

23 The appellant argued that:
 
 
 &#8226; his Honour erred in holding that it was not illogical, capricious or perverse for the tribunal to accept that in Australia the appellant had acquired knowledge of the Local Church and attended its meetings while concluding that she had not engaged in its activities in China as she claimed;
 &#8226; the tribunal failed to accord her procedural fairness in accordance with s 425 of the Act. The appellant argued that the delegate's decision had not identified or involved any finding that she had acquired knowledge of the Local Church and attended meetings only in Australia. Indeed, it would have been very difficult for the delegate to have made such a finding since the application for a protection visa was made within six weeks of her arrival her and did not refer to any involvement she had with the Local Church in Australia. That local involvement appears to have arisen at the end of the tribunal hearing (based on its recitation in its statement for decision and reasons of what happened then) and the tribunal's investigation of the letter dated 8 October 2006 from the Local Church;
 &#8226; the delegate had found that she had had a low key role within the Local Church in China and that the tribunal had not referred to this as an issue arising in relation to the decision under review for the purposes of s 425(1) of the Act, as explained in SZBEL 228 CLR at 162-164 [33]-[40] per Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. In effect, the appellant argued that she had not been informed that an issue arising on the review was that she had fabricated her association with the Local Church by attending meetings in Australia and gaining her knowledge of Christian beliefs and practices solely in the short period in which she was in this country, in particular the period between lodging her application and its refusal by the delegate. In this regard, she relied on the formulation that I had considered to be arguable when granting leave to appeal ( SZJYA [2007] FCA 1168 at [12] .</text>

<tocase>SZKTI v Minister [2008] FCAFC 83</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/83.html</AustLII>
<text>39 As noted above, in its statement of decision and reasons the tribunal set out a summary of the evidence given by the appellant at the hearing. At the very end of that account the tribunal recorded simply that she had told it that she had been attending a Local Church at Blacktown (a suburb of Sydney) and that 'Tony' was the leader. Next, the tribunal recorded that after the hearing the appellant provided it with a letter from the Local Church in Sydney which confirmed her attendance there for the previous six months before she had moved to Brisbane one month earlier. It said that this information was confirmed when the tribunal contracted the Local Church (cp SZKTI v Minister [2008] FCAFC 83).

40 In the section of its decision headed "Findings and Reasons" the tribunal then made its adverse finding under s 91R(3). It did so on the express basis that it did not find the appellant to be credible. However, on its own account of its hearing and procedures, it never raised with her anything to suggest that the genuineness of her conduct here was an issue arising in relation to the delegate's decision (see: s 425(1)). Nor on the face of the delegate's decision could such an issue have arisen, since the delegate did not refer to any conduct of the appellant in Australia.

41 The issues concerning the appellant's conduct in Australia and her knowledge of the Local Church were not matters referred to by the delegate; rather they were new issues raised by the tribunal. And, the tribunal's findings about the appellant's conduct in Australia were integral to its findings that, at the time of its decision, first, she was not a genuine practitioner and secondly, that there was no real chance she would be persecuted for a convention reason if returned to China.</text>
