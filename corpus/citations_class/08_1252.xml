<text>7 On behalf of the Minister my attention was drawn to a number of prior authorities which bear upon the construction of the word "information", as it appears in s 424A, and on the construction generally of that section. In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at 1196, para 18, the following passage appears in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ:
 Third and conversely, if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the Appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of paragraph (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the Appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information." Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 477, para 24 that the word "information": 
 
 "does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc." 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons, but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The Appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in circumstances or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration v Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/264.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Earlier in time, in their joint judgment in Minister for Immigration v Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 at pages 595-596, para 123, Merkel and Hely JJ observed:
 Accordingly, the remaining issue is whether the relevant country information was information that fell within the exclusion in s 424A(3)(a) because it "is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member". The information was not specifically about the first respondent or another person. It was, however, about a class of persons: namely, the persons in Bangladesh who are likely to be targeted for violence by their political enemies. Significantly, the RRT found that the first respondent was not a member of that class. Without reference to authority, and applying a literal meaning to the words used in s 424A(3)(a), the relevant country information can be characterised as information that is not specifically about the appellant or another person and is not about a class of persons of which the applicant or the other person is a member. On that basis the information would not be excluded under s 424A(3)(a) and would therefore be required to be given under s 424A(1).

9 Later in their joint judgment at pages 599-600, para 138, their Honours further observed:
 As is demonstrated by the differences of opinion within the Court to which we have referred, s 424A is not incapable of a construction that gives effect to the intention of the legislature. Accordingly, albeit for reasons that differ from those expressed in VHAP and by Beaumont J, we are also of the view that the reference in s 424A(3)(a) to the class of persons is not another criterion to be met but, as is the case with s 57(1)(b), is designed to underline the specificity required by precluding any argument that reference to a class could be taken as a reference to all individuals (including for example, an applicant) falling within it: see VHAP at [14]. It follows that the Magistrate was in error in failing to find that the relevant country information fell within the exclusion in s 424A(3)(a), and in finding that the RRT failed to comply with s 424A(1).</text>

<tocase>SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/2.html</AustLII>
<text>10 Observations made by Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 262, para 216 also serve as a reminder of the need, in relation to the application of s 424A in particular cases, to read the reasons of the Tribunal as a whole, in order to understand whether particular "information" truly provided the "reason" for the Tribunal's decision.

11 When one reads the reasons for decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal one sees the following paragraphs which in the circumstances of the present case are material. At appeal book page 90:
 As put to the applicant in the course of the hearing, generally speaking, members of the Hindu community in India are not ill-treated. In consideration of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a political, ethnic/racial or a religious profile that means he has suffered any persecution as contemplated by the Convention or that there's a real chance of this occurring to the applicant in the reasonably foreseeable future. 

 The Tribunal appreciates that there are religious based tensions in India. However, on balance, independent country information indicates that whilst there are problems in some areas, the Indian Constitution provides for freedom of religion and that the government generally respected this right in practice 
 etcetera.

12 Further, at appeal book page 91, the Tribunal stated:
 In essence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there are Convention reasons as to why the applicant should not return to India. In consideration of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a political, ethnic/racial or a religious profile that means that there is a real chance of persecution as contemplated by the Convention occurring to the applicant in the reasonably foreseeable future. Notably and by his own admission, the applicant wants to stay in Australia to work, raising serious doubts about his claims of persecution. In sum, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.

13 The Tribunal's reasons are very detailed indeed. Reading them as a whole, one sees that influences on the conclusions reached in the passages which I have quoted were an assessment by the Tribunal of the male Appellant's credibility, having regard to evidence which he gave before the Tribunal and independent country information.

14 The authorities to which I have made reference make it plain that the country information does not constitute "information" for the purposes of s 424A and further, that the Tribunal's views in relation to credibility do not constitute "information". Those views do not seem to have been informed by reference to anything provided in the initial visa application. Thus, the question as to whether the exclusion found in s 424A(3) as it stood prior to the insertion of s 424A(3)(ba) is not raised for consideration.</text>
