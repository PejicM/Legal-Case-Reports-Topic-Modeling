<text>1 The applicant, Clough Engineering Ltd, by motion seeks an order granting leave to appeal from a judgment, Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082 given on 21 December 2007. The motion is supported by an affidavit of Natalie Jane Wigg sworn 16 January 2008 deposing to the applicant's belief that there are reasonable grounds to appeal. The grounds of appeal are set out in a draft Notice of Appeal dated 16 January 2008. The first respondent, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ("ONGC") has filed an affidavit sworn on 7 February 2008 by its solicitor Mr Dean Edward Grondal. It contains matters concerning the pending arbitration proceedings commenced in India by Clough against ONGC in which various very substantial claims are made arising from the Construction Contract to which I refer below.

2 Clough and ONGC, are parties to a construction contract ("Construction Contract"). The formal contract was made on 6 January 2005. It is a lump sum contract in excess of US$215 million and is for the development of certain oil and gas fields in the Krishna Godavari Basin located off the coast of the State of Andhra Pradesh in India. Additionally, onshore facilities were to be constructed at Odalarevu, near Amalapuram also in Andhra Pradesh. Clough is an Australian company. ONGC is an Indian company.

3 By instruments dated January 2005 ("performance guarantees"), each of the second to fourth Respondents ("Banks") equally between them guaranteed the payment of 10% of the contract price to ONGC. This equated to a little more than US$21.5 million.</text>

<text>16 The well known test generally applied is whether the decision below is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by an appellate court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397, 398, 400.</text>

<tocase>Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; [2000] 104 FCR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1572.html</AustLII>
<text>18 In Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; [2000] 104 FCR 564 at 584 [43] French J with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said that a "prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal" if the judgment, although interlocutory, has the practical operation of finally determining the rights of the parties.

19 Clough contends that for the Court to refuse leave would effectively deny it of the right to appeal from a final decision as to the construction of an important provision of the Construction Contract as well as in relation to the following matters: 
 
 
 (a) whether ONGC was entitled under the Construction Contract, on its proper construction, to call on the performance guarantees; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) whether ONGC acted unconscionably in contravention of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( TPA ) in calling on the performance guarantees, in all of the circumstances; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) whether Clough was, in fact and demonstrably, in breach of an obligation to renew the performance guarantees and an obligation to provide insurance certificates to ONGC, thereby depriving Clough's prima facie claim (which the primary judge accepted was made out) that Clough was entitled to relief for ONGC's contravention of s 51AA of the TPA ; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) whether the performance guarantees are not unconditional but conditional and whether they required ONGC to specify the amount actually payable by the banks, rather than making an umbrella claim for the full amount.

20 I made a final determination as to the proper construction of cl 3.3.3, although the motion then before me was interlocutory in nature: Clough Engineering Ltd [No 3] at [20]-[53].

40 It submits that this distinguishes this case from those contemplated in Johnson Tiles at [43]. The "practical operation" of the judgment, it says, is not to determine finally the rights of the parties because the proper construction of cl 3.3.3 of the Construction Contract and the entitlement of ONGC to call upon the performance guarantees are all live issues, amongst others, in the arbitration proceedings. Further ONGC, through counsel, undertook to the Court that it would not raise the judgment of this Court as any barrier to those issues being determined again in the arbitration. That is not to say that the judgment of this Court would not be pressed on the Indian Arbitrators by ONGC as carrying considerable weight.

41 The view I take is that the judgment has the practical effect of determining the parties' rights. It is no answer to say that a different result might ensue in a different proceeding in another jurisdiction which could have the result of restoring the position of Clough.

42 In any event, if an appeal were successful it would not be necessary to prosecute that aspect of Clough's claims in the arbitration. The effect, then, of the submission is that the arbitration proceedings provide Clough with a de facto appeal. In my opinion, Clough ought be entitled to exhaust its legal entitlements in this Court.</text>
