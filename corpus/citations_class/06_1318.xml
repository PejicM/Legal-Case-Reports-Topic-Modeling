<text>In Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97, Black CJ and Moore J said at [15]: 
 
 'The formulation of separate or preliminary questions is authorised by O 29, r 2 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). But it is a procedure that should be adopted with caution and can be fraught with difficulties.'</text>

<tocase>Meat Industry Employees' Union and Another v G &amp; K O'Connor [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80</tocase>

<text>In Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union and Another v G &amp; K O'Connor [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 (' O'Connor '), the Full Court of this Court said at [70]: 
 
 'It is sometimes useful to determine, by way of a preliminary question, an issue between parties that, if resolved in a particular way, may terminate the litigation. However, if this is to be done, it is essential the question be firmly grounded on specified facts; whether found by the court, agreed between the parties or alleged in a pleading. Without that, the answer to the question may not only be academic but can have the effect of confusing or misleading the parties, rather than enlightening them.'

The Full Court in O'Connor then noted that in the case before it no facts were specified and it was inappropriate to determine the separate question determined at first instance.</text>

<tocase>Rainsford v Victoria and Another [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/163.html</AustLII>
<text>Further, in Rainsford v Victoria and Another [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279 (' Rainsford '), the Full Court of this Court said at [35]: 
 
 'Whilst the use of the separate questions procedure can, in some circumstances, avoid delay and lessen the expense in resolving a proceeding, the cases show that there can also be significant difficulties in adopting the procedure, "especially where no findings of fact have been made and the questions are capable of different interpretations": see Anderson v Wilson [2000] FCA 394 ; (2000) 97 FCR 453 at [28] per Black CJ and Sackville J.'

Importantly, in Rainsford , the Full Court said at [36]: 
 
 'In order for a court exercising federal jurisdiction to utilise the separate questions procedure, either the parties must agree upon the relevant facts or the court must determine the facts before seeking to decide the question.' (Emphasis applied.)

In the current proceeding, Swanline and the respondents have not agreed on the relevant facts necessary to be found to determine the proposed separate questions. Further, Swanline has not placed before the Court in any affidavit the facts which it proposes the Court rely on to answer the proposed separate questions.

Swanline submits that the respondents' defence clearly identifies the material facts relevant to the determination of each separate question. However, that is not the case. The relevant parts of the defence merely raise the issues which Swanline wishes to have the Court determine separately. It is no answer to say that the respondents carry the onus of proving the matters pleaded in their defence that bear on the separate questions. The Court is still in the position where the test referred to in Rainsford at [36] is not satisfied.</text>

<tocase>Reading Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society and Another (1999) 217 ALR 495</tocase>
<text>In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that Swanline has discharged its onus of satisfying the Court that it is 'just and convenient' for the trial to be split in the manner sought; see Reading Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society and Another (1999) 217 ALR 495 at [9]-[10]. Apart from the difficulty caused by the absence of a factual foundation for the resolution to the proposed separate questions, there are other issues that will need to be addressed if Swanline succeeds on the separate questions. Any potential saving of time and cost may be minimal.

In any event, if I am overcautious in refusing the motion for determination of the proposed separate questions, such caution is justified by the fact that the pleadings in the proceeding are not finalised. Swanline has foreshadowed further amendments to its statement of claim. Until the pleadings are complete, it is difficult to assess the true utility of seeking to split the trial. However, as things currently stand, in the absence of a firm factual foundation for the resolution of the proposed separate issues, I consider that Swanline's application pursuant to O 29 r 2 should be dismissed with costs. 


 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.
