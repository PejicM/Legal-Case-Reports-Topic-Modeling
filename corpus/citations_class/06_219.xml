<tocase>Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349</tocase>
<text>65 The applicant referred to the numerous cases dealing with the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing. It submitted that where a clause gives a party more power than is legitimately needed to protect its interests, then, a duty of good faith should be implied into the exercise of that power. It relied upon the decision of Sheller JA in Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349 in support of this proposition. Like this proceeding, that case also involved a commercial lease. His Honour stated, at 368:
 
 "If a contract confers power on a contracting party in terms wider than necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of that party, the courts may interpret the power as not extending to the action proposed by the party in whom the power is vested or, alternatively, conclude that the powers are being exercised in a capricious or arbitrary manner or for an extraneous purpose, which is another way of saying the same thing. Thus, a vendor may not be allowed to exercise a contractual power where it would be unconscionable in the circumstances to do so...".

66 The applicant's contentions in relation to good faith are only of relevance if the notice is found to be valid. The applicant noted that if the notice was found to be valid, the effect of clause 3.2.2 would be to give the landlord a wide power. Therefore, so the applicant claimed, clause 3.2.2 is the type of clause in relation to which a duty of good faith should be implied.

67 The applicant submitted that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing was breached by the first respondent. It contended that the first respondent breached this duty through a combination of actions and omissions. First of these were the deficiencies in the notice, both in terms of its alleged vagueness and its substantive shortcomings. This was combined with sending the letter just before Christmas where, so the applicant says, a meeting had been arranged between the parties after the expiration of the 30 day period, and when the applicant says, to the knowledge of the first respondent, the 30 day period would expire when Mr Bertrand was on leave. The applicant also adds to these circumstances the fact that the notice was sent to Mr Bertrand, who Mr Allen know did not speak English as his first language, instead of Mr Jarman, to whom notices and other correspondence relating to the Mulgrave premises had always previously been sent.</text>

<tocase>Amalgamated Estates Ltd v Joystretch Manufacturing Ltd (1980) 257 EG 489</tocase>
<text>81 In support of this contention, the first respondent submitted that the notice closely resembled the rent review notice in Amalgamated Estates Ltd v Joystretch Manufacturing Ltd (1980) 257 EG 489 (" Amalgamated Estates "). That notice was in the following terms:
 
 "Dear Sirs, Re: 14 Regent Street and 3 Bank Street, Rugby. Pursuant to the terms of your Lease of the above premises dated December 7 1973, we hereby give you notice that we require a review of the yearly rental payable thereunder as from December 10 1978. We specify that the new rent payable as from December 10 1978 will be [sterling]10,000 per annum exclusive. This rent is proportionally in line with our recent lettings and reviews of other premises in the area with similar accommodation. 
 
 Please would you kindly acknowledge safe receipt of this notice by signing the enclosed copy notice and returning it in the stamped addressed envelope provided."

82 The notice in Amalgamated Estates was upheld as being valid. I shall return to Amalgamated Estates , and whether the reasoning in that case is applicable to the present proceeding later in these reasons for judgment.

83 The first respondent contended that the only substantive requirement of clause 3.2.2 is that the lessor subjectively assess the "proper rent for the premises" as defined. There is no requirement that this assessment be objectively "reasonable".

84 The first respondent relied upon a number of cases with comparable rent review clauses to support the proposition that all that the landlord must do is specify its subjective assessment of the rent it is up to the tenant to object.

87 The first respondent also relied upon Amalgamated Estates in relation to the claim that the notice did not comply with the substantive requirements of clause 3.2.2. In Amalgamated Estates the obligation was to pay "open market rental". The rent review clause (clause 3(a)) provided that "open market rental" was first to be determined in the following manner, namely:
 
 "specified in notice in writing signed by or on behalf of the Landlord and posted ... to the Tenant at the demised premises..."

88 The lease then provided for the lessee to serve a "counter-notice" if it objected to the rent specified by the landlord in the notice. In that case, Lawton LJ, with whom both Templeman LJ and O'Connor LJ agreed, stated at 491:
 
 "There are two questions, therefore, for decision in this case: (1) should there be implied into clause 3(a) of the proviso words to the effect set out in the defence, namely, that the sum specified by the landlords should be a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate of the open market rental value? ... 
 
 As to the first point, I have no doubt at all that the words which, it was submitted, should be read into clause 3(a) cannot be so read. The proviso deals with definitions and procedure. Clause (1) of the proviso provides that the open market rental must be a rent which might reasonably be demanded by a willing landlord, etc. Clause (3) sets out how that reasonable rent is to be fixed and it is to be done in three stages. First, the landlord is to specify his figure; then there are to be negotiations for an agreement if his figure is not at once accepted. That is clear from clause 3(b). If there is no agreement then there is to be arbitration. It is after all those steps have been taken that a reasonable rent is to be ascertained; and I can see no room at all in this lease for implying that the figure specified by the landlord must start with a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate of the rent."

89 Similarly, Templeman LJ stated at 493:
 
 "The first point made by Mr de la Piquerie for the tenant is that there must be an implied term that the landlord will only specify a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate of the open market rental value. That appears to me to be an unnecessary and unworkable proposition. If a landlord puts forward a preposterous figure for rent, the tenant can always serve a counternotice. It would be ludicrous if the court were obliged to decide whether the landlord's figure was a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate in order to decide whether the landlord's request for an increased rent was valid or wholly void. The court does not exist to punish a landlord for being greedy, especially as the definition of "greed" varies from Shylock to Portia and from landlord to tenant."

144 The cases relied upon by the first respondent as upholding notices in a similar form are, in my view, distinguishable from the notice in this case. The first respondent placed particular reliance upon the notice that was upheld in Amalgamated Estates . That notice was in a much clearer form than that in the present case. The relevant clause in the lease required the landlord to specify the open market rental by notice in writing. The notice stated:
 
 "Pursuant to the terms of your Lease of the above premises dated December 7 1973, we hereby give you notice that we require a review of the yearly rental payable thereunder as from December 10 1978. We specify that the new rent payable as from December 10 1978 will be [sterling]10,000 per annum exclusive."

145 Moreover, the validity of the notice in Amalgamated Estates was not challenged on the basis of its form, but rather on the basis that the landlord had not specified a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate of the open market rental on the property in question.</text>

<text>130 Since Mannai , that test has been repeatedly applied in English courts.

The test has been applied in this Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244 per Bennett J (in the context of a notice of termination).

<tocase>Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2001) 109 FCR 33</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1915.html</AustLII>
<text>133 I note that bankruptcy notices arguably constitute an exception to this approach. In Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2001) 109 FCR 33, the majority in a specially constituted court of five (Black CJ, Heerey and Sundberg JJ, Lee and Gyles JJ dissenting) held that the misstatement in a bankruptcy notice of the statutory provision under which interest was being claimed served to invalidate the notice. This was so even though the correct sum of interest was claimed. The majority found that it was irrelevant whether a debtor might be misled or not. Their Honours came to this view on the basis that the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) made the requirement to specify the relevant legislative provision essential. In my view, such an approach is not relevant to these proceedings. In any event, it would only make it more difficult for the first respondent to establish the validity of the notice.

134 The applicant and first respondent both agree that the notice in this proceeding must be considered as a composite of the letter from Mr Allen addressed to the Manager of Nobi Holdings, and the Colliers letter. The applicant acknowledged, correctly in my view, that the notice did not need to refer to clause 3.2.2, and did not have to inform the recipient of the 30 day period within which to object to the increased rent. Nor did it have to adopt any particular form of words to be valid.

135 Even taking this into account, I am unable to find that the notice satisfies the relevant test of validity, as outlined above at [129]. In my view, the notice is not expressed unequivocally and would leave a reasonable person in receipt thereof in doubt as to its effect.</text>

<tocase>Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523</tocase>
<text>132 The test laid down in Mannai is consistent with approaches taken to the validity of notices, or analogous documents, outside of contract law. For instance, in Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523, Burchett J warned, at 533, against adopting an "overly technical view" in considering the validity of search warrants. He stated, at 544, that in relation to the search warrants at issue in that case, "[t]he language may be infelicitous", however the nature of the offences specified in the search warrants was clear, and the search warrants were therefore valid. His Honour cited, at 543, New Zealand authority which adopted the test of what a "reasonable reader" would "gather" from the search warrants to determine whether they sufficiently indicated the offence involved: see Rural Timber Ltd v Hughes [1989] 3 NZLR 178.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/24.html</AustLII>
<text>93 The first respondent contended that for a term to be implied, it must be "reasonable and necessary": Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 450. The first respondent submitted that an implied term of good faith was neither reasonable nor necessary in this case. It submitted that the mechanism established by the lease, allowing the lessor to nominate the rental assessment and the lessee to object, contemplates that the rent specified in the lessor's rental assessment may not be reasonable, or otherwise acceptable to the lessee. The first respondent submitted that the presence of the objection mechanism demonstrates that no such implied term is necessary.

94 The first respondent contended that the implication of such a term would alter the effect of the rent review mechanism agreed to, as it would enable a lessee to ignore a notice and "embark upon a curial challenge".

95 Even if such a term were to be implied, the first respondent submitted that the content of that term would require nothing more of the first respondent than that the rental assessment contained in the notice be an honestly held opinion. The first respondent submitted that the evidence supports the contention that the assessment contained in the notice represented the honest opinion of Mr Allen.</text>

<tocase>Catley v Watson (1983) V ConvR |P54-003</tocase>
<text>38 The first of these cases was Catley v Watson (1983) V ConvR |P54-003, which involved a notice of rescission served by a vendor upon a purchaser. In that case, "copyright condition 5" of the contract provided for the service of a notice of rescission. Brooking J stated, at 62,115:
 
 "In my opinion, a notice under copyright condition 5 is not valid unless it is, in relation to its essential features as required by that condition, clear and unambiguous. By this I mean, not that its import must be clear beyond the slightest peradventure, but that its terms must be such that a reasonable person, having given it fair and proper consideration, would be left in no doubt as to its meaning. A notice is not unequivocal, in the sense in which such notices are required to be unequivocal in relation to their essential contents, if a reasonable person, having considered the notice as a whole, fairly and properly, might entertain a doubt as to its meaning in relation to some essential matter, even though he would form in his mind a preference for one view, rather than the other of what the notice was intended to convey. It must be possible to say that, after the appropriate consideration, any doubts that may have arisen would have been quieted and the purchaser would not be left in any uncertainty as to the meaning of the notice...". (emphasis added)

39 Plainly, Catley v Watson can be relied upon only by analogy as it concerns the requirements for a valid rescission notice and not the requirements for a valid rental review notice.

48 Lastly, the applicant cited Central Pacific (Campus) Pty Ltd v Staged Developments Australia Pty Ltd (1998) V ConvR |P54-575 (" Central Pacific "). That case, like Catley v Watson , involved a rescission notice. Callaway JA, with whom Buchanan JA agreed, stated at 66,909 that the relevant approach is to ask:
 
 "whether a reasonable person who had considered the notice as a whole and given it fair and proper consideration would be left in any doubt as to its meaning."

152 I should note that in Central Pacific , it was suggested that the test expounded in Mannai was distinguishable from that in Catley v Watson : see Ormiston JA at 66,903 and Callaway JA at 66,909.

153 For my part, I cannot discern any difference in the effect of the tests in Mannai and Catley v Watson . Nor could the Victorian Court of Appeal in MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May (see [82] per Gillard AJA (with whom Winneke P and Buchanan JA agreed)).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSC/2000/290.html</AustLII>
<text>116 The second respondent submitted that pleadings may be amended after the close of evidence provided that any new facts raised by the amendment were the subject of evidence and the other party had an opportunity to litigate them. It contended that this case was not one where an amendment should be permitted so that the pleadings reflect the conduct of the trial and the issues litigated between the parties. Rather, the second respondent "cast its defence in a particular way on the basis of one case and is now faced with a different case that it may have fought differently". See EFM Pty Ltd v New Zealand Steel (Aust) Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 290 at [24] per Warren J. As such, the second respondent claimed that it would be prejudiced should an amendment be allowed. It said that had this matter been pleaded, it could have cross-examined Mr Jarman or Mr Bertrand as to the value of the fixtures and fittings that are additional to those set out in schedule 2.

117 The applicant submitted in closing that the onus lies upon the respondents to prove that the alleged misconstruction of clause 3.2.2 was not material. Although the respondents both objected to this proposition, if it were held to be correct, the second respondent submitted that it has not had the opportunity to lead evidence as to the value of the "additional" fixtures and fittings.

118 The first respondent also submitted that it would have called additional evidence, and further cross-examined witnesses had this matter been pleaded. In particular, it said that it would have led additional evidence from Mr Allen in relation to his state of mind as to the inclusion of fixtures and fittings at the time he served the notice, would have cross-examined the applicant's witnesses as to the value of the fixtures and fittings falling outside of schedule 2, and would have considered calling further valuation evidence.</text>

<tocase>GHD Pty Ltd v Wayne [2001] QSC 73</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/2001/73.html</AustLII>
<text>147 The closest the first respondent came to finding an analogous notice, the validity of which was upheld, was GHD Pty Ltd v Wayne [2001] QSC 73 (" GHD "). In that case the lease was similar in substance to clause 3.2.2 and required the relevant amount to be specified by notice in writing. The relevant notice stated:
 
 "As you will be aware your lease provides for a review of rental from 29 September 1999. The Lessor proposes that there will be no change in the rental from the present level for the year commencing 29 September 1999."

148 The notice then went on to deal with a proposal to renegotiate the terms of the lease to take account of the introduction of the goods and services tax legislation. The lessee submitted that the use of the term "proposes" rather than "specifies", and the discussion of the GST proposal, rendered the notice equivocal, and therefore invalid. The lessee also contended that the failure to specify an actual amount or refer to fair market rental suggested the notice represented a step in a preliminary negotiation before the rent review machinery was triggered.

149 Mackenzie J rejected these submissions. His Honour noted that the matter was one of impression and that, in his view, the notice adequately conveyed the requisite meaning that the lease required to be conveyed.

150 GHD is distinguishable from the present case. In GHD , Mackenzie J took the view that the GST discussion could be severed, or treated separately, from the rent review portion of the letter, and that the rent review portion of the letter was sufficiently clear. If, in the notice at issue before me, the first respondent had simply referred to the lease and stated, as the lessor did in GHD , "the Lessor proposes that the rental commencing 1 March 2003 be $435,920 pa", and there was no ambiguous reference to the Colliers letter, the notice may well have been valid. However, the Colliers letter cannot be severed from this notice, and the reference to it in Mr Allen's letter, and the nature of the Colliers letter itself, import doubt into the meaning of the overall notice.

151 Accordingly, I find that the notice was not sufficiently clear to be a valid notice pursuant to clause 3.2.2 of the lease.</text>

<tocase>GR Mailman &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Wormald (Aust) Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 80</tocase>
<text>85 In GR Mailman &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Wormald (Aust) Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 80 (" Mailman "), the rent review clause, art 2.02(a), was in the following terms:
 
 "Within sixty days (60) prior to the expiration of each period specified ... the Lessor may give in writing, in the form set out hereunder, to the Lessee increasing the yearly rental to an amount which the Lessor considers will be the current market rent of the Demised Premises as at the Review Date and until the following Review Date or the expiration of the term as the case may be ... having regard to all matters then relevant to the determination of such rent including the terms and conditions of this Lease and in particular the fact that the Lessee is obliged to pay to the Lessor the Outgoings provided in Article 3 thereof."

86 In that case, Gleeson CJ stated, at 89:
 
 "The lease also (in art 2.02(d)) states the consequences of the failure of the lessee to serve a counter-notice within the specified time. The lessee is deemed to have agreed upon the current market rent for the next review period. ... 
 
 Moreover, the rent that is deemed to be the current market rent may be quite different from the actual market rent, at least so long as the lessor subjectively holds the belief referred to in art 2.02(a) ." (emphasis added)

156 In my view, clause 3.2.2 did not require the lessor to stipulate a "reasonable" or "non-excessive" sum. I reject the applicant's contention that the rent review clause in Mailman was not comparable to that at issue in this proceeding. Mailman required the lessor to give notice of what it considered was the "current market rent", having regard to certain matters. Clause 3.2.2 requires a statement of "the sum which the Lessor assesses to be the proper rent", taking into account certain assumptions and having regard to certain matters. Consistent with Gleeson CJ's statement in Mailman , as long as Mr Allen subjectively held the belief that this sum was the "proper rent", the requirements of clause 3.2.2 would have been satisfied. I am not prepared, on the basis of the evidence before me, to infer that Mr Allen did not hold such a belief.

157 The applicant's case in relation to breach of an implied term of good faith proceeded upon the assumption that the notice was found to be valid, and that therefore, clause 3.2.2 gave the first respondent the type of wide powers that would invoke the implication of the term. As I have found that the notice was invalid, the issue does not strictly arise. I do not propose therefore to say anything further about this aspect of the proceeding.

158 Much the same could be said about the applicant's claim under s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act . However, I do wish to make some brief comments about one element of that claim. Section 51AA requires one party in a transaction to be under some sort of special disadvantage which the other party unconscientiously takes advantage of. As previously indicated, the special disadvantage in this case was said to be the fact that Mr Bertrand spoke English as a second language.

159 Mr Bertrand was cross-examined in English and was able to communicate clearly and effectively during that process. He was taken to various documents and had no trouble understanding them. At the time of the events relevant to this application, Mr Bertrand was the General Manager of a sizeable commercial operation in Australia. Consequently, the applicant would have fallen well short of establishing that Mr Bertrand had a special disadvantage capable of invoking the operation of s 51AA.

160 As I have found the notice to be invalid, the claim against the second respondent for misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act is moot. As the notice is invalid, the applicant cannot be said to have suffered loss or damage by virtue of the representations in the Colliers letter. Accordingly, the application against the second respondent is dismissed.</text>

<text>164 The authorities are clear that the applicant does not itself have to rely upon the misrepresentation in order to make a claim under s 82. It may be sufficient for a third party to rely upon the misrepresentation, and for that third party reliance to cause the applicant's loss. See Janssen-Cilag Pty Limited v Pfizer Pty Limited (1992) 37 FCR 526 (" Janssen-Cilag "), Haynes v Top Slice Deli Pty Limited (1995) ATPR (Digest) |P46-147 (" Haynes "), and McCarthy v McIntyre [1999] FCA 784. However, the authorities require a "sufficient and direct link", or a "requisite element of proximity" in order for s 82 to be satisfied.

166 In Haynes , the applicants purchased a franchise from Top Slice Deli. Top Slice Deli's accountants had sent misleading financial information to the bank which approved the applicants' loan to purchase the franchise. As against the accountants, Einfeld J found at 53,152:
 
 "Even if the bank's approval of the loan was an antecedent condition of entry into the agreements ...there was not an effective or true nexus between the approval and the entry. To adopt the language of Justice Lockhart, any resulting loss from the failure of the business is both a remote and indirect, not the "natural and direct", result of the relevant conduct. It therefore falls outside section 82..."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/52.html</AustLII>
<text>171 In my view, the applicant's failure to object to the notice, if it were found to be valid, would constitute a break in the chain of causation. Put another way, at its highest, what the second respondent would have "caused" was a rental assessment notice to be sent which specified an annual rental which did not reflect the "proper rent" as defined in clause 3.2.2. While negligence on the part of a "victim" of a contravention is not a defence to a claim for damages under s 82, this does not apply where the victim's conduct operates so as to destroy the causal connection between the contravention and the loss or damage: Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459 at 468 per Gleeson CJ.

172 Accordingly, had the notice been valid, and had the other claims against the first respondent failed, I would not have found the second respondent liable to pay damages under s 82 even if it had, by preparing the letter, contravened s 52, because the second respondent, by its conduct, would not have caused the applicant's loss.

173 It is clear from what I have already stated that the applicant is entitled to a declaration that the notice upon which the first respondent relied for increasing the rent was not a valid notice pursuant to clause 3.2.2. It follows that the notice was of no effect.</text>

<tocase>Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437</tocase>
<text>119 In response, the applicant submitted that from the time during the trial that Mr Allen gave evidence he was not required to ignore fixtures and fittings other than those identified in schedule 2, it was clear that the applicant contended that this was a basis for invalidity of the notice. It relied upon the statement of the Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ in Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437, at 446, where their Honours said:
 
 "If in the cause of action upon which the plaintiff sued there had emerged at the conclusion of the evidence facts which, if accepted, established that cause of action, then it was the duty of the trial judge to leave the issue of negligence to the jury. The pleadings should have been amended in order to make the facts alleged and the particulars of negligence precisely conform to the evidence which had emerged. ... Now, and for many years past, a plaintiff does not fail by being refused leave to amend or through failure formally to apply for amendment, where the evidence has disclosed a case in the cause of action fit to be determined by the tribunal of fact. Particularly is this so when the action finally determines the rights of the parties in the cause of action."

120 In my view, it is clear that the applicant's case that the notice is invalid because it included all the fixtures and fittings in the rental assessment, was not adequately pleaded. In the paragraphs of the pleading extracted above which claim the notice is invalid, there is no reference to fixtures and fittings or to schedule 2. Moreover, these paragraphs expressly focus upon another criterion upon which the proper rent is to be assessed, namely regard being had to comparable premises in the municipality. As such, fixtures and fittings are expressly excluded from the question of whether the rent was invalidly assessed. Accordingly, the applicant requires leave to amend its statement of claim to plead this aspect of its case.

121 Whether I should grant such leave after the conclusion of evidence is a thorny issue. The respondents have both claimed that to do so will prejudice their case. They say, with some force, that they would have presented their case differently, including possibly leading new evidence, had the pleading been amended earlier. However, the reasons the applicant gives for not pleading this claim earlier are persuasive as well. There is weight in the applicant's submission that these were matters within the knowledge of the first respondent, and that they only arose in the course of Mr Allen's cross-examination. As such, the applicant was in no position to either plead, or open, in relation to this matter.</text>

<tocase>Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] UKHL 19 ; [1997] AC 749</tocase>
<text>74 The first respondent submitted that the notice must be construed objectively and in context: Carradine Properties Ltd v Aslam [1976] 1 WLR 442 and Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] UKHL 19 ; [1997] AC 749 at 767 (" Mannai "). The first respondent also submitted that a reasonable recipient is to be credited with knowledge of the terms of the lease: Mannai . See also MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May [2004] VSCA 29.

130 Since Mannai , that test has been repeatedly applied in English courts. See, for example, the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Lancecrest Limited v Asiwaju [2005] EWCA Civ 117 (" Lancecrest "). The test has been applied in this Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244 per Bennett J (in the context of a notice of termination). It has also been applied by the Victorian Court of Appeal in MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May [2005] VSCA 29 (in the context of a notice seeking enforcement of a term of a contract), by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Etlis v New Age Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 165 (in the context of a notice triggering an extension of time in relation to building work), and in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in McIntyre v Marshall [2004] NSWSC 412 (a vendor's notice to complete), Gibbins Thomson Pty Ltd v Council of the City of Liverpool [2004] NSWSC 1172 (a notice of failure to meet obligations under the contract), and Heaps v Addison Wesley Longman [1999] NSWSC 1093 (a notice from a tenant requesting the appointment of a second valuer in relation to a rent review).

132 The test laid down in Mannai is consistent with approaches taken to the validity of notices, or analogous documents, outside of contract law. For instance, in Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523, Burchett J warned, at 533, against adopting an "overly technical view" in considering the validity of search warrants. He stated, at 544, that in relation to the search warrants at issue in that case, "[t]he language may be infelicitous", however the nature of the offences specified in the search warrants was clear, and the search warrants were therefore valid. His Honour cited, at 543, New Zealand authority which adopted the test of what a "reasonable reader" would "gather" from the search warrants to determine whether they sufficiently indicated the offence involved: see Rural Timber Ltd v Hughes [1989] 3 NZLR 178.

142 In any event, the correct test to apply is not whether there is enough in a notice to put a reasonable tenant on inquiry to find out if a notice was indeed intended by the lessor to be a notice under 3.2.2. Nor is the subjective reaction of the recipient of the notice relevant: see Mannai at 767 per Lord Steyn and Lancecrest at [38]-[43] per Neuberger LJ and [88] per Brooke LJ. Either the notice is unequivocally a notice made pursuant to clause 3.2.2, or it is not. If the meaning of the notice is in doubt, objectively viewed, the notice is invalid.

152 I should note that in Central Pacific , it was suggested that the test expounded in Mannai was distinguishable from that in Catley v Watson : see Ormiston JA at 66,903 and Callaway JA at 66,909.

153 For my part, I cannot discern any difference in the effect of the tests in Mannai and Catley v Watson . Nor could the Victorian Court of Appeal in MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May (see [82] per Gillard AJA (with whom Winneke P and Buchanan JA agreed)).</text>

<tocase>McCarthy v McIntyre [1999] FCA 784</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/784.html</AustLII>
<text>102 The second respondent submitted that relief for third party reliance on misleading or deceptive conduct is only available in the limited circumstance where the contravention was a "sine qua non" of the claimant entering into a transaction . It relied upon the statement by Hill, Sackville and Katz JJ in McCarthy v McIntyre [1999] FCA 784 at [50] in support of this submission:
 
 "Where a claimant is able to show that, but for the misleading or deceptive conduct, he or she would not have entered into a transaction, then such loss as flows directly to the claimant from the transaction will satisfy the requirement of causation. This is so where the claimant relies upon the misleading or deceptive conduct (the usual case). It is also so where a third party whose action was a sina qua non of the entry by the claimant into the transaction (the present case as alleged) relies upon the misleading or deceptive conduct."

103 No such transaction was entered into by the applicant, and nor, according to the second respondent, did the applicant itself rely upon the representation.

104 Further, the second respondent contended that if relief is more generally available for third party reliance in the circumstances of this case, the applicant's loss was not caused by the conduct of Colliers. Rather, the second respondent submitted that the applicant's loss was caused by their own failure to object to the notice, and/or the unconscionable conduct of the first respondent or its breach of the implied term of good faith, if indeed these causes of action are established.

105 The second respondent acknowledged that negligence on behalf of the "victim" is not a "defence" to a s 52 contravention (although I note that the Act has now been amended such that "contributory negligence" can be taken into account so as to reduce damages under s 82). However, the second respondent contended that this proposition does not apply where the conduct of the "victim" destroys the causal connection between the contravention of the Act, and the loss or damage suffered. In other words, the second respondent submitted that the applicant's failure to respond to the notice constituted a novus actus interveniens that broke the chain of causation.

106 As previously mentioned, the respondents submitted that the applicant did not adequately plead the claim that the notice is invalid because it failed to assess the rent on the assumption that only the fixtures and fittings in schedule 2 were to be taken into account. Nor, according to the respondents, had the claim been opened, or supported by any evidence specifically adduced in relation to it. As such, the respondents contended that the applicant is required to seek leave to amend its statement of claim in order to pursue this claim. The respondents opposed any such leave being granted.

164 The authorities are clear that the applicant does not itself have to rely upon the misrepresentation in order to make a claim under s 82. It may be sufficient for a third party to rely upon the misrepresentation, and for that third party reliance to cause the applicant's loss. See Janssen-Cilag Pty Limited v Pfizer Pty Limited (1992) 37 FCR 526 (" Janssen-Cilag "), Haynes v Top Slice Deli Pty Limited (1995) ATPR (Digest) |P46-147 (" Haynes "), and McCarthy v McIntyre [1999] FCA 784. However, the authorities require a "sufficient and direct link", or a "requisite element of proximity" in order for s 82 to be satisfied.

167 In McCarthy v McIntyre , a bank relied upon a misleading valuation in making a loan. The appellant suffered loss from the transaction entered into using the funds from the loan. The issue in that case was whether, if the transaction would not have been entered into by the appellant had it not been for the making of the loan, was this sufficient to make a claim under s 82. The Full Court (Hill, Sackville and Katz JJ) stated at [48]-[50]:
 
 "All that is necessary, in our opinion, is that there be a sufficient and direct link (ie, causation) between the loss or damage alleged to have been suffered by the claimant and the misleading or deceptive conduct. 
 
 It is well established that the misleading or deceptive conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss. ... Precisely what test should be used to judge what constitutes the sufficient causal connection required between the misleading conduct and the outcome is the subject of some difficulty. Perhaps there is no simple test capable of formulation. It is necessary that the issue of causation be approached in what the High Court in Wardley called a "practical or commonsense" way. In many areas, the courts have applied a "but for" test of causation. As McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ pointed out in Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd at 346, the idea that a "but for" test is the exclusive test of causation has been found wanting in some contexts and it may yet be found to be wanting in the context of ss 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act (and their State equivalents). Whether this be the case or not, the "but for" test, applied in a common sense and not a pedantic way, provides still a useful approach to the issue of causation. 
 
 Where a claimant is able to show that, but for the misleading or deceptive conduct, he or she would not have entered into a transaction, then such loss as flows directly to the claimant from the transaction will satisfy the requirement of causation. This is so where the claimant relies upon the misleading or deceptive conduct (the usual case). It is also so where a third party whose action was a sina qua non of the entry by the claimant into the transaction (the present case as alleged) relies upon the misleading or deceptive conduct."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1250.html</AustLII>
<text>168 The matter was then remitted to the primary judge to make factual findings. The remittal judgment was also appealed. In that appeal ( McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250) , Whitlam, Emmett and Hely JJ found, at [53]:
 
 "there is no basis for concluding that, if the valuation of the Tropicana Hotel had been in the order of $2,100,000, Westpac would not have advanced the same proportion of the valuation, namely, $1,071,000 rather than $1,622,000. That, of course, would have given rise to the need to borrow additional funds elsewhere. There is no evidence to support a conclusion that it would not have been possible to borrow the additional funds from another source."

169 The reasoning of their Honours is relevant to this case. It cannot be said that "but for" the Collier's assessment, Mr Allen would have sent the applicant a notice for less than the sum actually specified in the notice. It is quite possible that a higher figure may have been specified, given that Mr Allen gave evidence that he believed Mr Williams' figure was "a bit low", and actually thought that the Mulgrave premises were worth more. Mr Allen would have been well within his rights to serve a notice which specified a higher amount, if he believed that this reflected the proper rent, taking into account the relevant criteria outlined in clause 3.2.2. The applicant's case would require me to make findings about "what would have happened" but for the alleged misleading conduct in a way that would border upon pure speculation.

170 Not being able to satisfy the "but for" test would have been a serious problem for the applicant. There is, however, a further insurmountable hurdle in relation to the applicant's case in relation to causation.</text>

<tocase>National Australia Bank Ltd v Nobile (1988) 100 ALR 227</tocase>
<text>122 Amendments to pleadings should be allowed if it would not be unjust to do so: see National Australia Bank Ltd v Nobile (1988) 100 ALR 227 at 235-6 per Davies J. In my view, that test cannot be satisfied in the present case. The fact is that the respondents have been denied the opportunity to put on further evidence as to the value of the additional fixtures and fittings. They would be prejudiced if an amendment were allowed. Accordingly, leave to amend the further amended statement of claim is denied.

123 The appropriate course for the applicant to have taken was for it to have sought leave to amend its statement of claim after the conclusion of Mr Allen's evidence. It was during that evidence that the applicant contended it became clear that it would rely upon this ground as a basis for invalidity of the notice. By doing this, it may have avoided the prejudice it now claims it will suffer as a result of the pleadings not reflecting its claims in relation to the fixtures and fittings.

124 In any event, I would decline the application for leave to amend in part on the basis that the applicant's submission regarding the proper construction of clause 3.2.2 is by no means compelling (though it is plainly arguable). It is clear that the strength of the applicant's case, in relation to the proposed amendment, is a relevant consideration when determining whether to grant leave to amend. Had the applicant demonstrated a stronger case, regarding this issue, I may have been minded to allow the applicant to reopen its case, and the respondents to adduce further evidence in response. When all that can be said is that there is an arguable case, the balance of convenience weighs against adopting that course.</text>

<tocase>Norwich Union Life Insurance Society v Tony Waller Ltd (1984) 270 EG 42</tocase>
<text>40 The applicant also cited the case of Norwich Union Life Insurance Society v Tony Waller Ltd (1984) 270 EG 42. That case dealt with a rent review clause and a notice purportedly served pursuant to that clause. The notice was not addressed to the tenant by its proper title and was flawed in other respects. It was in the following terms:
 
 " Without Prejudice
 Dear Sir, 19 Fawkon Walk, Hoddesdon.
 
 We have been instructed by your landlords, the Norwich Union Insurance Group to negotiate with you in connection with the rent review contained in your lease which becomes operative as at September 29 1982. 
 
 It is out clients proposal to increase the rental to [sterling]11,500 per annum exclusive as from this date. 
 
 We trust that this increase is acceptable to you and would be obliged if when replying you would enclose the name and address of the solicitors who will be acting on your behalf. 
 
 Yours faithfully".

41 In that case, Harman J stated, at 43:
 
 "I have been much impressed with Mr Pryor's argument that this document was in truth equivocal. It is common ground between the parties that no specific form has to be adopted in order to constitute a trigger notice. Mr Wood's submission was that it should be a clear and unequivocal notice giving plain intimation to anyone receiving it of what it was. Certainly, that is, in my view, the desirable state of all such notices. But it being common ground that no special form of words is necessary no magic formula is involved the question is: trying to read it as a whole, looking at its confused terminology, its meaningless heading "Without prejudice" and its general ineptitude, is this a document which a tenant looking at it would think was a trigger notice?"

42 His Lordship concluded by finding, at 43, that:
 
 "although there are no magic words or magic formulae to be required before a rent review clause is invoked, ... the document does have to be clear and plain to any recipient."</text>

<tocase>Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) Inc [2002] FCA 860 ; (2002) 120 FCR 191</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/860.html</AustLII>
<text>99 The second respondent argued that Mr Williams was asked by Mr Allen for a "ball park" figure only, and that Mr Williams relied upon information provided by Mr Allen to inform the opinion expressed in the letter. The second respondent contended that all that was required of Mr Williams was that the opinion he expressed was honestly held and had a proper foundation: Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) Inc [2002] FCA 860 ; (2002) 120 FCR 191 at 213. The second respondent submitted that Mr Williams' opinion was honestly held, and that he had a proper foundation for the opinion, namely the regard he had to comparable developments at Caribbean Gardens and a development called the "Pellicano development". It contended that Mr Williams was not required to undertake a detailed independent valuation. The relevant "standard" in terms of a proper foundation for the opinion was that of a real estate agent, rather than that of an independent valuer. Mr Williams is a real estate agent and could never provide a detailed, independent valuation.

100 In any event, the second respondent submitted that the figure provided by Mr Williams was within a permissible range of latitude that is appropriate for an "assessment" of this kind (14%), to that provided by Mr Finkemeyer. As such, the Colliers letter cannot be considered misleading.

101 Should the Colliers letter be found to be misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , the second respondent contended that it is not sufficient for the applicant to claim that the first respondent relied on the representation in order to make out a claim for damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act .</text>

<text>115 The second respondent gave numerous examples of cases where it said leave to amend in similar circumstances had been refused. See Lewis v Sydney Flour Pty Ltd (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 189, Burnham v City of Mordialloc [1956] VLR 239, Ralph v Strutton [1969] Qd R 348 and Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) Ltd v Farrington (1996) 44 NSWLR 634.</text>

<tocase>Rural Timber Ltd v Hughes [1989] 3 NZLR 178</tocase>
<text>132 The test laid down in Mannai is consistent with approaches taken to the validity of notices, or analogous documents, outside of contract law. For instance, in Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1991) 31 FCR 523, Burchett J warned, at 533, against adopting an "overly technical view" in considering the validity of search warrants. He stated, at 544, that in relation to the search warrants at issue in that case, "[t]he language may be infelicitous", however the nature of the offences specified in the search warrants was clear, and the search warrants were therefore valid. His Honour cited, at 543, New Zealand authority which adopted the test of what a "reasonable reader" would "gather" from the search warrants to determine whether they sufficiently indicated the offence involved: see Rural Timber Ltd v Hughes [1989] 3 NZLR 178.</text>

<tocase>Shirlcar Properties Ltd v Heinitz (1983) 268 EG 362</tocase>
<text>43 The applicant also relied upon the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Shirlcar Properties Ltd v Heinitz (1983) 268 EG 362 (" Shirlcar Properties "). That case also involved a rent review clause and "trigger" notice. The only matter at issue as to the validity of the notice was whether there was any doubt as to its meaning.

44 The body of the trigger notice was in the following form:
 
 "We act on behalf of your Landlords, Shirlcar Properties Ltd, and have been instructed to deal with the rent review on the above premises due as at the 29 th September 1981. The rent required as from the review date is [sterling]6,000 pa exclusive, and we look forward to receiving your agreement. 
 
 Yours faithfully".

45 The agent's signature then followed. However, as Lawton J explained at 363:
 
 "a difficulty has arisen because the letter did not end with the signature of the estate agents: under that signature in capital letters which were underlined came the words "subject to contract". Immediately below that, also in capital letters, were the words "recorded delivery". "

143 It is true that the notice is headed "Notice of Rental Assessment commencing 1 March 2003 for 42-44 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave". However, the notice must be viewed as a whole and Shirlcar Properties makes it plain that what may otherwise be a valid notice can be invalidated by additional statements which affect the clarity, and import doubt, into the rest of the notice. In my view, the characteristics of the notice, outlined above at [136], import uncertainty and ambiguity into the notice.</text>

<tocase>United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904</tocase>
<text>179 In determining what orders may be appropriate, the parties may wish to consider the applicability of the principles laid down in United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904 (" United Scientific Holdings ") in relation to the retrospective application of rent reviews completed outside the period provided for under the lease.

180 In United Scientific Holdings , the House of Lords held that there was nothing in that case that displaced the presumption that strict adherence to the timetables specified in the relevant rent review clauses was not of the essence of the contract.

181 There were in fact two separate cases decided in United Scientific Holdings . The first involved a rent review on a 99 year lease. The review was to occur each ten years after the commencement of the lease, with the new rent to commence on 31 August of that year. The rent review mechanisms provided that the revised rent was to be determined by agreement, or failing agreement, by arbitration "during the year immediately preceding" the 10 year period to which that rent would relate. By the end of the first 10 year period, such agreement had not been reached, and nor had the matter been referred to arbitration.

182 The second case involved a 21 year lease, commencing upon 8 April 1968. The rent was to be reviewed every seven years. The relevant machinery provided for the lessor to serve a notice on the lessee, and the lessee to serve a counter-notice accepting the proposal or making a counter-offer. The parties were then to negotiate. If agreement had not been reached after a certain time, the lessor was required to appoint an independent valuer. In this case, the lessor's notice was served within time. However, no agreement had been reached by the parties, and the lessor failed to appoint an independent valuer within the time provided for under the lease.

183 In both cases the House of Lords held that time was not of the essence in relation to the clauses in the leases which the lessors had not complied with. The lessors had not lost the opportunity to have the rent for the next rental period reviewed by virtue of not complying with the time periods set down in the rent review machinery clauses.

184 The potential significance of the case for this proceeding in terms of any final orders that may be made is as follows. The House of Lords held that once the relevant terms were complied with (namely an arbitration concluded in the first case and independent valuation conducted in the second case), the new rent would be payable from the date that the lease provided that the new rental period was to commence. That is, despite the lessors' tardiness, not only did they maintain their rights to rent reviews, but once the rent reviews were completed, the revised rent applied retrospectively as if those reviews had been completed on time.

185 Whether the parties wish to consider or rely upon United Scientific Holdings in putting forward orders to reflect my reasons for judgement is, however, a matter for them.

186 There is also potentially a difficult question to be resolved regarding costs. The applicant has succeeded against the first respondent in relation to its claim that the notice was invalid. However, there were a number of other issues raised in relation to which it either did not succeed, or would not have succeeded. That is a matter that may have to be taken into account.

187 With regard to the second respondent, it is sufficient to note, for present purposes, that the applicant's claim against it must be dismissed. It is clear that the second respondent will be entitled to its costs. Beyond these findings, it may be necessary to hear the parties further.</text>

<tocase>Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/55.html</AustLII>
<text>163 In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514, the High Court held that s 82 plainly incorporates the concept of causation. Mason CJ stated at 525:
 
 "The statutory cause of action arises when the plaintiff suffers loss or damage 
 "by" contravening conduct of another person. "By" is a curious word to use. One might have expected "by means of", "by reason of", "in consequence of" or "as a result of". But the word clearly expresses the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it. In this situation, s.82(1) should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation recently discussed by this Court in March v. Stramare (E. &amp; M. H.) Pty. Ltd. , except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act. (footnote omitted)</text>
