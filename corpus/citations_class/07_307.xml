<tocase>Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239</tocase>
<text>12 Section 153B(1) of the Act relevantly provides that:
 
 "If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made ...the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy." 
 

 Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are:
 
(1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402.
 
(2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy "carries a heavy burden". It is incumbent on an applicant "to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.
 
(3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order "ought not to have been made" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.
 
(4) A sequestration order "ought not to have been made" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396.
 
(5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422.
 
(6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.
 
(7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243.
 
(8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24-5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79] ; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7] .

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>29 The Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award costs but that discretion must be exercised judicially: see Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (1979) 42 FLR 213 at 219. Any departure from the ordinary rule that costs should be paid on a party-party basis requires the presence of something special or unusual in the conduct of the case to be demonstrated: see Preston v Preston [1981] 3 WLR 619 at 637. The types of case in which it may be appropriate to award indemnity costs do not fall in any closed categories: see Tetijo Holdings Pty Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, French J, 3 May 1991). One type of case in which it has been held that indemnity costs might be ordered is that in which an applicant pursues a hopeless case. In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401 Woodward J said:
 
 "I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding "solicitor and client" or "indemnity" costs, whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he no chance of success. In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the Court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion."

<tocase>Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/22.html</AustLII>
<text>21 There is no doubt that the Court has a discretion, in the interests of justice, to order that Mr Bulic's case should be reopened so that he can adduce further evidence and advance further argument: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] . The availability of "fresh evidence" will, in some circumstances, warrant the reopening of a case.

22 Mr Bulic submits that the documents would establish a number of negative propositions. They are that:
 
 &#8226; There are no documents held by the respondent which contain any direct proof of Mr Bulic's indebtedness in the sum alleged.
 &#8226; The files appear to have been "culled" and are incomplete. 

It is also suggested that the documents appear, in some instances, to be confusing and self contradictory. The balance inquiries which, it is said, should be examined by an expert accountant are numerous. They are printouts of computer records on various dates between 1990 and 1992. They relate to each of the four accounts held by Mr Bulic with the respondent and its predecessor. Each records debit and credit entries over a particular period. They appear to have been printed at the instigation of bank officers and used as the basis for the calculation of Mr Bulic's indebtedness from time to time.

23 The respondent accepts that the Court has a discretion to reopen the case but submits that there is nothing in the newly produced material which would warrant such a step being taken. This is because there is nothing in that material which could reasonably be regarded as advancing the case already put by Mr Bulic. It contends that, on the contrary, there is certain documentary material which confirms Mr Bulic's indebtedness to it, in the amounts alleged, at relevant times.</text>

(4) A sequestration order "ought not to have been made" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396.
 
(5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422.
 
(6) If the Court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose the creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order: Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.
 
(7) The power conferred on the Court by s 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the Court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243.
 
(8) Considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose the creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made: Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 24-5; Boles at 247; Re Papps; ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [79] ; Cottrell v Wilcox [2002] FCA 1115 at [7] .

<tocase>Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10</tocase>
<text>12 Section 153B(1) of the Act relevantly provides that:
 
 "If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made ...the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy." 
 

 Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are:
 
(1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402.
 
(2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy "carries a heavy burden". It is incumbent on an applicant "to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.
 
(3) In determining whether or not a sequestration order "ought not to have been made" the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made. The Court must take account of facts, known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the Court at the time at which the sequestration order was made: Boles v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2001) 183 ALR 239 at 243; Re Raymond; ex parte Raymond (1992) 36 FCR 424 at 426.
 
(4) A sequestration order "ought not to have been made" if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the Court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order: Re Frank; ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396.
 
(5) The Court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 422.

<text>29 The Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award costs but that discretion must be exercised judicially: see Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (1979) 42 FLR 213 at 219. Any departure from the ordinary rule that costs should be paid on a party-party basis requires the presence of something special or unusual in the conduct of the case to be demonstrated: see Preston v Preston [1981] 3 WLR 619 at 637. The types of case in which it may be appropriate to award indemnity costs do not fall in any closed categories: see Tetijo Holdings Pty Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, French J, 3 May 1991). One type of case in which it has been held that indemnity costs might be ordered is that in which an applicant pursues a hopeless case. In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401 Woodward J said:
 
 "I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding "solicitor and client" or "indemnity" costs, whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he no chance of success. In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the Court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion."
