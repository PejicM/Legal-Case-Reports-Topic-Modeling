<tocase>Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1829.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 , Madgwick J recognised that different descriptions can be given of the one injury and said at [18] that ' a broad, generous and practical interpretation ' should be made to recognise the understanding of the lay person making the claim and different levels of medical advice and to understand whether the lay person completing it was asserting a different injury to that notified. The Tribunal said that, in applying the principles in Abrahams , it was satisfied that the proper interpretation of the claim made by Mr Sellick was for ' an injury which caused pain in the upper back, which included, but was not limited to, pain in the area of the right scapula '. Accordingly, the Tribunal determined that although Mr Sellick did not then suffer the effects of the soft tissue injury to the right shoulder, it could proceed to consider whether he continued to suffer the effects of the aggravation of the degenerative condition of his spine and the sprain of the interspinous ligament. Based on the views of Drs Griffith and Cassar, the Tribunal found that his duties are likely to continue to aggravate those conditions and to make the conditions symptomatic.

56 The Tribunal accepted that the effects of the injury to the right shoulder had resolved by the date of its decision. While it did not specify whether it had resolved by the date of the reviewable decision, it is implicit from the reasoning that the Tribunal accepted that it had resolved by that time. The basis for the Tribunal's decision was that the use of the V-sort machine also caused the additional conditions. The effects of the additional conditions continued to be present at the date of the decision and, therefore, necessarily present at the date of the reviewable decision. While the Tribunal noted at [55] that Mr Sellick's description of his symptoms was referable to one or both of the additional conditions, it accepted on the basis of the medical evidence as a whole that he suffered from both injuries (at [59]). Contrary to the submissions of Australia Post, the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently explain why it accepted both diagnoses.

57 No accident report or claim was specifically made for the additional conditions as is required by ss 53 and 54 of the SRC Act. If the additional conditions had not been the subject of a notice of injury under s 53, a claim for compensation under s 54, a determination under s 60, a reviewable decision under s 62 and an application to the Tribunal under s 64 of the SRC Act, the Tribunal had no power or jurisdiction to make the decision that it did. Australia Post accepts that, as the Tribunal noted, the medical certificates provided in support of the shoulder claim referred to complaints referable to the upper back and not related to the shoulder. A medical assessment by Dr Chew of July 2004 noted that Mr Sellick suffered from mid thoracic spine pain in October 2002 with no specific injury to account for the onset of his pain. Dr Chew's diagnosis of his then current condition was of soft tissue injury to his mid thoracic spine while carrying out his postal delivery duties, superimposed on constitutional degenerative changes in his thoracic spine. Australia Post accepts that the reviewable decision addressed whether the problems were due to an underlying constitutional disorder not caused, aggravated or accelerated by his employment. However, a mere reference to the spine in some of the medical certificates is, Australia Post says, insufficient compliance with the SRC Act.

60 There is no explanation given by the Tribunal for the conclusion that the injury of October 2002, described as pain in the right shoulder, caused the additional conditions. Even if the claim were for injury to another part of the body that resulted in right shoulder pain, the Tribunal accepted that the effects of that injury had resolved. Unlike Abrahams where the applicant for review described a wrist injury but did not state the correct diagnosis, the injury to Mr Sellick's shoulder had resolved and different injuries were accepted as a basis for liability. The injuries may have arisen out of Mr Sellick's employment with Australia Post (as accepted at [60]) but the Tribunal has not explained how they arose out of the claimed injury in 2002. It is noteworthy that the medical reports of 2002 summarised by the Tribunal were not the ones referred to as supporting the Tribunal's conclusions.

61 Mr Sellick accepts that the Tribunal characterised the additional conditions as injuries separate to the injury to the right shoulder and that it found three separate injuries, all suffered in 2002. He says that the Tribunal at [66] only accepted that Mr Sellick no longer suffered the effects of the soft tissue injury to the right shoulder but continued to suffer pain, including pain in the right shoulder, arising from the spinal injury and the sprain to the interspinous ligament. If that is the case, the Tribunal's reasoning is far from clear. At [52] the Tribunal expressed itself satisfied that ' at present he does not suffer the effects of ' a soft tissue injury to his shoulder but was satisfied that, at the date of its decision, he ' continues to suffer, pain in the mid-upper back as a result of an aggravation of the condition of degenerative cervical spondylosis and/or a chronic sprained interspinous ligament '. That is, the only ongoing pain as at the date of the Tribunal decision was in the mid-upper back and not in the shoulder.

62 Dr Cassar's report noted that the claimed injury was ' right shoulder girdle injury '. He referred to association with the cervical spine. Changes to a minor degree noted in the upper thoracic spine were, in his view, unrelated to employment but aggravated by ' persisting work necessitating constant above shoulder work...as well as work necessitating repeated lifting of full postal bags weighing in excess of 10kg '. Dr Griffith referred to cervical spondylosis which was not work related with "minimal changes" in the thoracic region and said that it was "likely" that the use of the V-sort ' aggravated the symptoms from which he now suffers '. Dr Griffith's prognosis was of cervical and thoracic spondylosis with periodic exacerbations and remissions ' irrespective of activities in the workplace '. He was also of the view that pre-existing degenerative changes would have been rendered symptomatic by activities in the workplace. While each report linked Mr Sellick's work activities and the pain in the mid-thoracic spine, they did not explain the connection with the claimed injury.

70 In circumstances where all pain resulting from the injury ceased when Mr Sellick ceased duties and the claimed injury causing pain in the right shoulder had resolved, the Tribunal did not give reasons for its conclusion that the additional conditions, which it accepted to be different injuries but work-related, were caused by or connected with the claimed injury. This is not a case, like Abrahams , where the medical diagnoses differently described the same injury as that claimed. The way that Mr Sellick described the pain in his shoulder did not limit the relevant injury only to the right shoulder. However, the claim was for an injury that covered pain in the right shoulder. The Tribunal accepted that both the pain to the shoulder and injury to the shoulder had resolved. The Tribunal did not explain how the additional conditions that continued after the shoulder pain resolved were related to the claimed injury of shoulder pain.</text>

<tocase>Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/184.html</AustLII>
<text>35 Australia Post accepts that the Tribunal does not need to cover every aspect of every factual matter. It submits, however, that the Tribunal failed to consider submissions of substance which, if accepted, were capable of affecting the outcome of the case. Such a failure constitutes an error of law, as does the failure to consider a claim or the integer of a claim ( Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; Casarotto v Australian Postal Corporation [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 403 per Hill J citing Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v FCT (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276 per Jenkinson J). Australia Post relies on the silence of the Tribunal's reasons in respect of the various specific matters raised. A failure to advert to the content of submissions does not of itself necessarily mean that the matter was not considered ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 279 per Finn J). If the particular submission did not go to the substance of the decision or would not have affected the outcome, failure to advert to it in the reasons does not mean that the matter was not considered and does not give rise to error of law.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>91 A decision made under an enactment is invalid if there is a total absence of evidence to satisfy an essential element of the decision. The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355-356 per Mason CJ).

92 Section 44(1) of the AAT Act provides that:
 
 
 (1) A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding.

93 Section 5 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides that:
 
 
 (1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision to which this Act applies that is made after the commencement of this Act may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for an order of review in respect of the decision on any one or more of the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision; 
 
 
 
 
 ...

95 Section 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act contains a stipulation in the word "involved" that the error be material in contributing to the decision so that but for the error, the decision might have been different ( Bond at 353 354 per Mason CJ, East Australia Pipeline Pty Ltd v ACCC [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 239 ALR 50 at [71] per Gummow &amp; Hayne JJ). As discussed, the error of the Tribunal in respect of the second reviewable decision is such an error of law.

101 Mr Sellick submits that where an appeal lies under s 44 of the AAT Act, applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act should be dismissed unless the subject of the appeal is a decision going to practice and procedure. He relies on Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288 at [12] where Edmonds J dismissed an ADJR Act application where the Tribunal decision did not go to practice and procedure. His Honour followed Tuite v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [1993] FCA 71 ; (1993) 40 FCR 483 where Davies J had held that, as s 44 of the AAT Act provides a specific procedure for the granting of relief by the Court in respect of decisions of the AAT, that procedure should be adopted and applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act, where an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act is available, should be dismissed as of course (at 484). Justice Davies expressed the view at 484 that questions of law as provided for in s 44 of the AAT Act encompass grounds enunciated in s 5 of the ADJR Act. Duong was decided prior to Etheridge , a decision of the Full Court and Tuite was decided prior to Birdseye, which discussed the difficulties in the framing of questions of law . Further, the ADJR Act is not only available for matters of practice and procedure ( Bond at 337 per Mason CJ; Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [89] [90] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ).</text>

<tocase>Australian Postal Corporation v Barry [2006] 44 AAR 186</tocase>
<text>72 The medical opinion accepted by the Tribunal, given some two years after the claimed injury, was that the additional conditions were aggravated by Mr Sellick's work duties. The Tribunal does not explain how the claimed pain and injury of 2002 which had resolved resulted in the additional conditions which, in turn, were the reason for Mr Sellick's ongoing pain. The 2004 diagnoses were made well after the injury he sustained in 2002. Mr Sellick has not demonstrated how they fulfil the claim requirements of the SRC Act. It is impossible to understand from the Tribunal's reasons the reasoning process that led it to conclude that Australia Post continued to be liable for a claimed injury that had resolved and where the claimed symptoms of that injury had resolved. The Tribunal accepted that the additional conditions were caused by or rendered symptomatic by Mr Sellick's work duties but did not explain the connection with the specific claim. Failure to consider issues critical to the validity of its decision is a failure to address the correct legal question which is an error of law ( Australian Postal Corporation v Barry [2006] 44 AAR 186 at [23] [24]). There is an error of law where the Tribunal's reasoning is impossible to understand ( Lang at [55]).

99 Justice Branson pointed out at [27] and [30] in Etheridge that judicial review under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act is also available for Tribunal decisions under the SRC Act where such an application is made. In Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 Branson J referred at [8] to the fact that the ADJR Act provided an alternative source of jurisdiction to the AAT Act. In Barry Branson J made orders under s 5 of the ADJR Act for errors of law when it was not clear that the Court's jurisdiction under s 44(1) of the AAT Act was properly invoked. Mr Sellick argues that her Honour's comments in Etheridge and Brown are obiter and that Ms Barry was unrepresented so that no submissions on jurisdiction under the ADJR Act were made.</text>

<text>98 In Birdseye , the appeal was brought in reliance on s 44 of the AAT Act. Justices Branson and Stone expressed approval of comments made by Gummow J in TNT Skypack International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 where his Honour pointed out that where an appeal lies "on a question of law" the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated ( Birdseye at [11]; cf Etheridge at [13]). Their Honours also approved the comments of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corp v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 namely that ' If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like "erred in law" or "was open as a matter of law" can make it into a question of law ' ( Birdseye at [13] [15]; cf Etheridge at [15]). Accordingly, a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within s 44(1) of the AAT Act ( Birdseye at [18]).</text>

<text>97 In Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 , Branson J (Spender and Nicholson JJ agreeing) stated at [14] that the legislature, by creating a statutory right of appeal to a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in the narrow terms of s 44(1) of the AAT Act, ' disclosed an intention to limit the capacity of the Court on an appeal under s 44(1) to review factual findings of the Tribunal '. An appeal under s 44 is therefore different to an appeal by way of rehearing under s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Rather, an appeal under s 44 is of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law under s 45 of the AAT Act. Justice Branson also summarised (and applied) Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321.

98 In Birdseye , the appeal was brought in reliance on s 44 of the AAT Act. Justices Branson and Stone expressed approval of comments made by Gummow J in TNT Skypack International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 where his Honour pointed out that where an appeal lies "on a question of law" the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated ( Birdseye at [11]; cf Etheridge at [13]).

102 Several decisions of the Court have followed Tuite (eg Peczalski v Comcare (1999) 58 ALD 697 per Finn J ; Chowdhary v Bayne [1999] FCA 41 ; (1999) 29 AAR 100 per Finn J ; Percerep v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1088 ; (1998) 86 FCR 483 per Weinberg J) but Mr Sellick did not point to any case where that course was taken since Etheridge .

104 The ADJR Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act were introduced after the AAT Act. Decisions of the Tribunal have not been excluded by the schedule to the ADJR Act. The question of jurisdiction under those Acts in addition to jurisdiction under the AAT Act was considered by a Full Court in Etheridge . I see no reason to strike out the ADJR Act application as a matter of course. I do not accept Mr Sellick's submission that the applications cannot be advanced and heard simultaneously on similar grounds.</text>

A failure to advert to the content of submissions does not of itself necessarily mean that the matter was not considered ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 279 per Finn J). If the particular submission did not go to the substance of the decision or would not have affected the outcome, failure to advert to it in the reasons does not mean that the matter was not considered and does not give rise to error of law.</text>

<tocase>Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288</tocase>
<text>101 Mr Sellick submits that where an appeal lies under s 44 of the AAT Act, applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act should be dismissed unless the subject of the appeal is a decision going to practice and procedure. He relies on Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288 at [12] where Edmonds J dismissed an ADJR Act application where the Tribunal decision did not go to practice and procedure. His Honour followed Tuite v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [1993] FCA 71 ; (1993) 40 FCR 483 where Davies J had held that, as s 44 of the AAT Act provides a specific procedure for the granting of relief by the Court in respect of decisions of the AAT, that procedure should be adopted and applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act, where an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act is available, should be dismissed as of course (at 484). Justice Davies expressed the view at 484 that questions of law as provided for in s 44 of the AAT Act encompass grounds enunciated in s 5 of the ADJR Act. Duong was decided prior to Etheridge , a decision of the Full Court and Tuite was decided prior to Birdseye, which discussed the difficulties in the framing of questions of law . Further, the ADJR Act is not only available for matters of practice and procedure ( Bond at 337 per Mason CJ; Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [89] [90] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ).

103 Australia Post submits that Duong and Tuite should not be followed. It submits that s 10 of the ADJR Act makes it plain that the rights conferred by that Act are in addition to the rights otherwise conferred to review decisions. Mr Sellick submits that, if there is concurrent jurisdiction, the Court should exercise in discretion so that the grounds of review under the ADJR Act are no more extensive than questions of law available under the AAT Act.</text>

<text>23 Australia Post contends that the Tribunal forgot or overlooked the fact that Dr Burke and Dr McGill gave oral evidence, did not therefore deal with that evidence and accordingly failed to consider the case put by Australia Post. The evidence was referred to in submissions to the Tribunal. The Tribunal made no reference to the oral evidence of Dr Burke or Dr McGill. Australia Post submits that the Tribunal may have forgotten about the evidence in view of the time that elapsed between the evidence and the decision. Australia Post says that this gives rise to jurisdictional error or denial of natural justice because of the risk that the capacity of the Tribunal for competent evaluation of the evidence was diminished by the timeframe and the delay between the evidence and the decision ( NAIS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 at [10] - [11] per Gleeson CJ, [106] per Kirby J, [172] per Callinan and Heydon JJ).

<tocase>Hannaford v Telstra Corp Ltd (2005) 88 ALD 702</tocase>
<text>50 "Injury" is not defined in the SRC Act in terms of its cause but in terms of an injury suffered by an employee arising out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment. The Tribunal has authority to decide whether there was liability for a particular injury or an aggravation of a disease. The Tribunal is not bound by Australia Post's assessment of what constitutes the injury ( Hannaford v Telstra Corp Ltd (2005) 88 ALD 702). Section 7(4) of the SRC Act relevantly provides that an employee is taken to have sustained an injury, being a disease or an aggravation of a disease, on the day when he or she first sought medical treatment for the disease or aggravation. Mr Sellick does not suggest that anything turns on the difference in time between the date of the injury and the seeking of medical advice. Section 7(6) relevantly provides that incapacity for work or impairment of an employee shall be taken to have resulted from a disease or an aggravation of a disease if, but for that disease or aggravation, the incapacity or impairment would not have occurred or would have commenced at a significantly later time or would have been significantly less in extent.

51 The only claim made by Mr Sellick in the approved claim form in relation to the upper body was for shoulder pain. Mr Sellick described his injury as ' pain in right shoulder '. Australia Post accepted liability for soft tissue injury of the shoulder girdle musculature. The Tribunal considered whether it had jurisdiction to take into account the effects of aggravation of the degenerative condition of the spine and ligamentous strain in deciding whether Mr Sellick had ceased to suffer the effects of the injury suffered in October 2002 and the preceding months. It expressed itself satisfied that the injury in respect of which Mr Sellick claimed compensation was not limited to the soft tissue injury of the right shoulder. It noted at [17] that the medical certificates ' at the time, or very soon after, the claim form was lodged, referred to strained muscles of the right upper back, upper back pain and interscapular stabilizer strain ' (at [63]).

52 The Tribunal also referred to Mr Sellick's history of informing some of the medical practitioners who examined him, including Dr Chew, that he suffered pain in the upper back, including the area of the mid-thoracic spine. The Tribunal concluded at [52] that:
 
 ...in the period of several months prior to and including October 2002 Mr Sellick suffered a soft tissue injury to his shoulder but that at present he does not suffer the effect of this injury .

<tocase>Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141</tocase>
<text>64 The Tribunal has an obligation to give reasons that make it possible to understand its reasoning process. Failure to do so is an error of law ( Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141 at [54]-[55] per Stone J citing TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85). This includes an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that is plainly central to a party's claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim ( Lang at [54] per Stone J). As was pointed out by Stone J in Lang at [53] [55], the Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight. It is under no obligation to refer to all of the evidence before it. There is no obligation to make a finding on every question of fact that may be regarded as objectively material. The Tribunal is entitled to refer to all the medical reports, as Mr Sellick says the Tribunal did and to accept and reject evidence as it sees fit. The Tribunal is entitled to reject medical evidence or simply to prefer contrary medical evidence. It is obliged, however, to include in its reasons findings on all material questions of fact. Where a failure to give reasons makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal's reasoning process, that is an error of law.

71 Further, the Tribunal did not explain how Australia Post was liable under the SRC Act. The notice and the claim referred to right shoulder pain which had resolved. The first reviewable decision can, read beneficially to Mr Sellick, be said to have included reference to the additional conditions in that it included a reference to Dr Shroot's and Dr Chew's medical certificates of 2004 that diagnosed some upper back pain and minor soft tissue injury to his thoracic spine. However, those conditions were found to have resulted in pain in a different area to that the subject of the claim, the mid-thoracic spine. The degenerative spinal condition was a pre-existing condition. While injury or disease of the thoracic spine was referred to in the first reviewable decision, it was not the subject of that decision. It was referred to in the context of pre-existing conditions which were not relevant to the claimed injury. In finding liability under the SRC Act for the additional conditions which had not been the subject of a notice of injury (s 53), claim for compensation (s 54), a determination under s 60, the first reviewable decision (s 62) and an application to the Tribunal (s 64), the Tribunal failed to observe the limitations on its jurisdiction flowing from these sections of the SRC Act and the procedural prerequisites to entitlement to compensation under the SRC Act ( Lang at [41] [43]; Lees at [35]).

72 The medical opinion accepted by the Tribunal, given some two years after the claimed injury, was that the additional conditions were aggravated by Mr Sellick's work duties. The Tribunal does not explain how the claimed pain and injury of 2002 which had resolved resulted in the additional conditions which, in turn, were the reason for Mr Sellick's ongoing pain. The 2004 diagnoses were made well after the injury he sustained in 2002. Mr Sellick has not demonstrated how they fulfil the claim requirements of the SRC Act. It is impossible to understand from the Tribunal's reasons the reasoning process that led it to conclude that Australia Post continued to be liable for a claimed injury that had resolved and where the claimed symptoms of that injury had resolved. The Tribunal accepted that the additional conditions were caused by or rendered symptomatic by Mr Sellick's work duties but did not explain the connection with the specific claim. Failure to consider issues critical to the validity of its decision is a failure to address the correct legal question which is an error of law ( Australian Postal Corporation v Barry [2006] 44 AAR 186 at [23] [24]). There is an error of law where the Tribunal's reasoning is impossible to understand ( Lang at [55]).

73 The Tribunal failed to give reasons for its conclusion that Australia Post was liable under the SRC Act. The Tribunal is obliged to give reasons for its decision (s 43(2) of the AAT Act). While not obliged to make a finding on every question of fact that is objectively material to the Court conducting judicial review ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [87] [97] ; Lang at [53]), the Tribunal is obliged to include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based (s 43(2B) of the AAT Act).</text>

<tocase>Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84</tocase>
<text>49 Section 53(1) of the SRC Act provides that the Act does not apply in relation to an injury unless notice in writing of the injury is given to the relevant authority ( Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84 at [35]). Compensation is not payable to a person under the SRC Act unless a claim for compensation is made by or on behalf of the person under s 54 (s 54(1)). Section 54(2) provides that a claim shall be made by giving the relevant authority a written claim in accordance with the form approved by Comcare and by giving a certificate by a legally qualified medical practitioner in accordance with the correct form.

71 Further, the Tribunal did not explain how Australia Post was liable under the SRC Act. The notice and the claim referred to right shoulder pain which had resolved. The first reviewable decision can, read beneficially to Mr Sellick, be said to have included reference to the additional conditions in that it included a reference to Dr Shroot's and Dr Chew's medical certificates of 2004 that diagnosed some upper back pain and minor soft tissue injury to his thoracic spine.

105 The grounds advanced by Australia Post which I have found to be made out do not relate to grounds of review that would involve further evidence (as in Percerep ). I am not satisfied that I should strike out the ADJR Act application or exercise the discretion in s 10(2) of the ADJR Act to refuse relief under that Act. The fact that there are errors of law that found relief under the ADJR Act that are identical to the errors of law that found questions of law as set out in the application filed under the AAT Act goes to the practical outcome of the relief, a single remittal to the Tribunal.</text>

<text>106 With respect to the first reviewable decision the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its conclusion that the additional conditions were work-related and were related to the claimed injury and that Australia Post was liable for those additional injuries. That failure constitutes an error of law. In relation to the second reviewable decision the Tribunal failed to consider an aspect of Australia Post's case. Further, the Tribunal made a factual finding which formed the basis for its conclusions for which there was no evidence. Accordingly, the Tribunal's decision is affected by error of law and jurisdictional error. The errors of law are of a kind that support an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act on a question of law ( Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 at [59] ).

<text>35 Australia Post accepts that the Tribunal does not need to cover every aspect of every factual matter. It submits, however, that the Tribunal failed to consider submissions of substance which, if accepted, were capable of affecting the outcome of the case. Such a failure constitutes an error of law, as does the failure to consider a claim or the integer of a claim ( Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; Casarotto v Australian Postal Corporation [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 403 per Hill J citing Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v FCT (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276 per Jenkinson J). Australia Post relies on the silence of the Tribunal's reasons in respect of the various specific matters raised. A failure to advert to the content of submissions does not of itself necessarily mean that the matter was not considered ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 279 per Finn J). If the particular submission did not go to the substance of the decision or would not have affected the outcome, failure to advert to it in the reasons does not mean that the matter was not considered and does not give rise to error of law.</text>

<text>98 In Birdseye , the appeal was brought in reliance on s 44 of the AAT Act. Justices Branson and Stone expressed approval of comments made by Gummow J in TNT Skypack International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 where his Honour pointed out that where an appeal lies "on a question of law" the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated ( Birdseye at [11]; cf Etheridge at [13]). Their Honours also approved the comments of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corp v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 namely that ' If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like "erred in law" or "was open as a matter of law" can make it into a question of law ' ( Birdseye at [13] [15]; cf Etheridge at [15]). Accordingly, a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within s 44(1) of the AAT Act ( Birdseye at [18]).</text>

<text>101 Mr Sellick submits that where an appeal lies under s 44 of the AAT Act, applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act should be dismissed unless the subject of the appeal is a decision going to practice and procedure. He relies on Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288 at [12] where Edmonds J dismissed an ADJR Act application where the Tribunal decision did not go to practice and procedure. His Honour followed Tuite v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [1993] FCA 71 ; (1993) 40 FCR 483 where Davies J had held that, as s 44 of the AAT Act provides a specific procedure for the granting of relief by the Court in respect of decisions of the AAT, that procedure should be adopted and applications brought under s 5 of the ADJR Act, where an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act is available, should be dismissed as of course (at 484). Justice Davies expressed the view at 484 that questions of law as provided for in s 44 of the AAT Act encompass grounds enunciated in s 5 of the ADJR Act. Duong was decided prior to Etheridge , a decision of the Full Court and Tuite was decided prior to Birdseye, which discussed the difficulties in the framing of questions of law . Further, the ADJR Act is not only available for matters of practice and procedure ( Bond at 337 per Mason CJ; Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [89] [90] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ).

102 Several decisions of the Court have followed Tuite (eg Peczalski v Comcare (1999) 58 ALD 697 per Finn J ; Chowdhary v Bayne [1999] FCA 41 ; (1999) 29 AAR 100 per Finn J ; Percerep v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1088 ; (1998) 86 FCR 483 per Weinberg J) but Mr Sellick did not point to any case where that course was taken since Etheridge .

103 Australia Post submits that Duong and Tuite should not be followed. It submits that s 10 of the ADJR Act makes it plain that the rights conferred by that Act are in addition to the rights otherwise conferred to review decisions. Mr Sellick submits that, if there is concurrent jurisdiction, the Court should exercise in discretion so that the grounds of review under the ADJR Act are no more extensive than questions of law available under the AAT Act.</text>
