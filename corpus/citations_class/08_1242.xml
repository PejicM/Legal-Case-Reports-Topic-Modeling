<text>2 Leave to appeal is required because the judgment below is interlocutory. The applicant's application was rejected as disclosing no arguable case pursuant to rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). Leave to appeal will only be granted where two criteria are satisfied. The first is that, in all the circumstances, the judgment below is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered on appeal. The second is whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the first instance decision was wrong: see D&eacute;cor Corporation v Dart Industries [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397.

3 The applicant is a citizen of India. He said that his father financed his travel to Australia by borrowing a large amount of money on the security of his father's house. He said he could be in some danger if he returned to India without having earned money to repay his father and that his family may abandon him.

4 The Tribunal found no connection between the applicant's concerns and persecution of a kind referred to in the Refugees Convention. It also considered that the applicant would not face a real chance of persecution as a result of his involvement in a single protest against the government.</text>
