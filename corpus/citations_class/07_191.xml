<text>This application relates to a purported appeal from a decision of Mansfield J delivered on 21 December 2005 ( Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885).

On 6 November 2006 I struck out the notice of appeal in ACD 4 of 2006 but granted leave to Mr Dunstan to re-plead by filing an amended notice of appeal on or before 2 February 2007, and the matter was stood over until today with costs reserved.

I indicated to Mr Dunstan on that occasion that the notice of appeal simply did not comply with the Rules of Court in relation to the form and substance of such a document, and explained that it was fundamental that there be a notice of appeal in proper form. I then adverted to the fact that legal advice in a situation of this kind is very helpful, if not essential. I also mentioned the possibility of some pro bono assistance. I have given some consideration to that again but I do not think that it is appropriate to take any steps in relation to that. This is a very particular case which Mr Dunstan presented himself before the trial judge, and to bring anybody in to deal with this on a pro bono basis is, I think on reflection, not likely to be helpful.</text>
