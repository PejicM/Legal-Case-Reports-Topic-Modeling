<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/601.html</AustLII>
<text>87 The applicant referred to Adelaide Brighton Cement v AWU [2002] FCA 601 , when faced with similar issues, von Doussa J, after considering Davids Distribution noted at [18]:
 
 The degree of specificity in a notice sufficient to enable the employer to take appropriate defensive action must be judged against the nature of the employer's undertaking and the way in which that undertaking operates. 
 

In that case, as here, the employer operated 12 hour day and night shifts and was left not knowing at what time on what day it would need to allocate labour to maintain its operations. His Honour found there was a serious question to be tried that the notice of industrial action failed to meet the requirements of s 170MO(5) (now 441 (6) of the Act ).</text>

<tocase>APRA v CPSU &amp; Anor, 21 June 2000, Print S7131</tocase>
<text>22 In upholding the validity of the notice, the Vice-President adopted the approach taken by the Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU (Print S7131) . That case was an appeal from a decision of Polites SDP and concerned the validity of a notice of initiation of bargaining periods and, in particular, whether, by including an additional employee organisation in the notice, the notice thereby was invalid. Polites SDP had held that the inclusion of another organisation of employees in the notice did not serve to invalidate the notice as between the initiating party and the negotiating party. He also held, assuming that he was wrong concerning the validity of the notice, on that ground, that the inclusion of the other organisation of employees could be severed from the other provisions of the notice and for that additional reason ought not to be regarded as invalidating the notice between the initiating party and negotiating party at [32].

23 The Full Bench, without more, merely adopted the reasons of Polites SDP in these respects: APRA v CPSU (Print S7131) at [22].

62 The applicant contended that:
 
 
 (i) protected industrial action can only occur during a bargaining period: ss 435(1) and (2). The Protected Action Notice indicates that employees will take industrial action "in respect of the notice of bargaining period BP 2007/8". The Initiating Notice was directed to 3 "other negotiating parties" (the applicant, the AMWU and CEPU) and stated that the respondent intended to try to make a collective agreement with the other negotiating parties. The particulars (at paragraph (b) of the Protected Action Notice) confirmed that the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period was one binding the applicant, the respondent, CEPU and AMWU; 
 


 
 
 (ii) there is no provision in the Act which allows a union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement. Where a union initiates a bargaining period the only other negotiating party is the employer: s 423(3) and (4). The ability to initiate a bargaining period with more than one union is confined to employers: s 423(4)(c). A defect of this kind is no mere technicality. The effect of a bargaining period is to modify existing legal rights. A union that is a negotiating party may take protected action: s 435(2). Severance is not possible because it will substantially alter the nature of the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period (as confirmed by the particulars). The inclusion of the CEPU and AMWU as "Other Negotiating Parties" was not a "slip". Both the particulars and the factual matrix in which the notice was served confirm that the respondent intended to negotiate an agreement with the applicant and the other 2 unions. The expired CSBP Agreement was an agreement between the applicant and the 3 unions and, since April 2006, the applicant and the 3 unions had been negotiating a new agreement to replace the expired agreement. Further, even if the references in the Initiating Notice to the AMWU and CEPU could be severed, it is seriously arguable that the notice would only then be valid so that a bargaining period would not come into effect for a further 7 days: s 427 of the Act ; 
 


 
 
 (iii) whereas a challenge to the validity of the Initiating Notice was rejected by Lawler VP in LHMU v CSBP Limited [2007] AIRC 112 , PR976150, at [17]-[18], and a similar challenge under the pre-reform Act was rejected by a Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU &amp; Anor , 21 June 2000, Print S7131 at [12], [14], [21]-[22], those decisions should not be followed. The point which arises in this case, and which was not addressed in those decisions, is not merely that the CEPU and AMWU have been erroneously named as negotiating parties in the respondent's notice. It is that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was particularised as, and was intended to be, an agreement between the respondent, the applicant and the CEPU and AMWU and that, by reason of s 423(4)(d) , a union cannot initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take protected industrial action in support of a multi-union agreement; 
 


 
 
 (iv) under s 435(2) of the Act , industrial action organised or engaged in during the bargaining period may be protected action but only if it is organised or engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of "the proposed collective agreement": s 435(2). The "proposed collective agreement" is that to which the bargaining period is directed [s 423(3)]: Trinity Garden Aged Care &amp; Anor v ANF , 21 August 2006, PR973718, at [43]. Accordingly, if the Initiating Notice is held to be valid, the result will be that the respondent will seemingly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the respondent to make an agreement with the respondent, the CEPU and the AMWU. Such an outcome is inconsistent with s 423(4)(d) which clearly evinces an intention that if a bargaining period is to be initiated in pursuit of a multi-union agreement (with the possibility that industrial action will then be taken in support of such an agreement), it must be initiated by the employer; 
 


 
 
 (v) the contrast with s 423(4)(c) , which expressly allows for more than one organisation to be a negotiating party where the initiating party is the employer, is telling. This is not a curious result. It is quite easy to envisage why Parliament would not have wished to give unions the ability to take industrial action to cause an employer to enter into a multi-union agreement, irrespective of the wishes of the employer. It is quite possible that Parliament considered the employer was best placed to determine whether a multi-union agreement was suited to the needs of the particular business and therefore that the employer should not be pressured into making a multi-union agreement if it did not wish to. The fact that, in the present case, the applicant is prepared to negotiate a multi-union agreement is not to the point. What is at issue is the capacity of the respondent union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement; and 
 


 
 
 (vi) if, as appears from s 435(2) , a union cannot initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement, there is at least a serious question to be tried that the respondent's Initiating Notice was invalid such that no bargaining period was initiated and the proposed industrial action will be unprotected and unlawful.</text>

<text>88 It is no answer, in the applicant's submission, to say simply that the only express temporal requirement in s 441(6) is that the notice specify the day when the action will begin. The authorities indicate that the purpose of the sub-section will not be met unless the action is described with sufficient specificity to enable the recipient of the notice (usually but not always the employer) to take appropriate defensive measures and the degree of specificity required will vary according to the nature of the employer's undertaking and the way it operates. It referred to AFMEPKIU v ACI Mould Manufacturing [1999] FCA 1859 (Goldberg J) at [25]-[28] (serious question that notice was invalid because it failed to state the end date of proposed action).

89 The respondent submitted that the Protected Action Notice is unambiguous in that the employees in question are those who are members of the respondent and who work as process technicians: there is no uncertainty as to whether the notice relates to some or all of those employees as it obviously relates to all of them.

90 The respondent then contended that the Protected Action Notice specifies that industrial action in the form of the Stoppage will commence on 6 April and that whilst it does not specify the time it will commence, the Act does not require this to be done. Section 444(6) merely requires written notice of "the day" when the intended action will begin.</text>

<tocase>Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v NUW [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1108.html</AustLII>
<text>79 This, the applicant said, was because in order to comply with s 441(6) of the Act a notice must describe the nature of the industrial action with sufficient particularity to enable an employer to take appropriate defensive action: Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v NUW [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at 494-5.

80 There are, according to the applicant, two difficulties with the Protected Action Notice. Firstly, the Notice of Action states:
 
 The employees to whom this notice relates are those employees of CSBP Limited who are members of the LHMU, who would be subject to the proposed collective agreement dealt with in bargaining period BP2007/8 and work as process technicians.

81 The applicant contends that it is ambiguous as to whether some or all of the process technicians, who are members of the respondent, are intended to take the threatened industrial action.

87 The applicant referred to Adelaide Brighton Cement v AWU [2002] FCA 601 , when faced with similar issues, von Doussa J, after considering Davids Distribution noted at [18]:
 
 The degree of specificity in a notice sufficient to enable the employer to take appropriate defensive action must be judged against the nature of the employer's undertaking and the way in which that undertaking operates. 
 

In that case, as here, the employer operated 12 hour day and night shifts and was left not knowing at what time on what day it would need to allocate labour to maintain its operations. His Honour found there was a serious question to be tried that the notice of industrial action failed to meet the requirements of s 170MO(5) (now 441 (6) of the Act ).

92 I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that the Protected Action Notice does not adequately state the nature of the intended action and was therefore not a valid notice. In Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v NUW , Wilcox and Cooper JJ (with whom Burchett J agreed on this point) said of then s 170MO(5), which was in the same terms as s 441(6) of the Act :
 
 84. . . . Parliament did not indicate what degree of specificity it intended by the term "nature of the intended action". To interpret this term, on the one extreme, as requiring no more than an indication of industrial action, as argued by NUW, would be significantly to devalue s 170MO(5); the notice would provide little information. To interpret it, on the other extreme, as requiring precise details of every future act or omission would be to impose on the giver of a notice an obligation almost impossible to fulfil. Industrial disputes are dynamic affairs. Decisions as to future steps often need to be made at short notice, sometimes in response to actions of the opposing party or other people, including governments, and changing circumstances. It would be a major, and unrealistic, constraint on industrial action to require a party to specify, three clear working days in advance, exactly what steps it would take. An unduly demanding interpretation of s 170MO(5) would seriously compromise the scheme of Div 8 of Pt VIB of the Act ; it would be difficult for a party to an industrial dispute to obtain the protection contemplated by the Division . 
 ... 
 87. We think s 170MO(5) was designed to ensure that industrial disputants who are to become affected by protected action, in relation to which their usual legal rights are significantly diminished, are at least able to take appropriate defensive action. For example, an employer may operate a sophisticated item of equipment that will be damaged if precipitately shut down. If warned in advance of a ban that might affect the continued operation of that plant, the employer might choose a controlled shut down during the period of the notice. More commonly, perhaps, an employer might use the notice time to communicate with suppliers and customers, and thereby reduce the consequences for them of the notified industrial action. Very often, the recipient of the notice will respond in a way that has a legal dimension. For example, a union might react to a notice by an employer of intent to lockout some employees by giving notice that all employees will strike indefinitely as from the commencement of the lockout. Similarly, an employer might respond to an employees' notice of bans by giving notice of a lockout of some or all employees.

93 The appropriate defensive action referred to by von Doussa J in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd included, by way of example, the shutting down of a sophisticated item of equipment, although in the context of potential damage to the equipment if precipitately shut down. In this case, whatever be the consideration concerning damage to the plant, there are very substantial safety issues concerned both with the shutting down of the plant safely but also in monitoring the plant whilst it is shut down: see the Woodside Petroleum and Burswood Resort cases referred to above. Arguably the Protected Action Notice should have specified the Process Technicians, if any, who would be available for safety duties during the proposed period of the industrial action. Whilst, at the hearing, this safety issue was resolved, by agreement, that fact does not assist the respondent in relation to the question of the efficacy of the Protected Action Notice: a question which falls to be considered in light of the content of the Notice, unaffected by the agreement reached at the hearing before me.</text>

<tocase>Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union - Western Australian Branch v CSBP Limited [2007] AIRC 112</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/AIRC/2007/112.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The applicant contended in the Commission before Lawler VP that it was not open under the Act for a union to initiate a bargaining period naming other unions as negotiating parties and accordingly it was submitted that the Initiating Notice was invalid and did not initiate a bargaining period. The Commission upheld the validity of the Initiating Notice: Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union Western Australian Branch v CSBP Ltd [2007] AIRC 112 ("the first Commission case").

20 Lawler VP in so finding said relevantly:
 
 [14] It is certainly arguable, as CSBP submits, that the effect of s 423 is that, while an employer is able to initiate a single bargaining period with more than one union as negotiating parties (see s 423(1) ,(3)), where a particular union initiates a bargaining period, only that union and the employer are negotiating parties (see s 423(1) and (4)) and that, accordingly, other unions who may wish to be part of the proposed collective agreement with the employer cannot be "negotiating parties" in relation to that particular bargaining period:

21 He continued: 
 
 To the extent that s 423 has the effect of preventing a union from initiating a bargaining period in which other unions are negotiating parties, I can see nothing in the legislation that would render invalid a notice by a union initiating a bargaining period merely because it (incorrectly) names other unions as a negotiating party. If s 423 has the effect for which CSBP contends then those other unions do not in fact become "negotiating parties" (in the particular bargaining period initiated by the giving of the notice) notwithstanding that they are named as "negotiating parties" in the notice. However, it does not automatically follow that the notice thereby becomes invalid or otherwise ineffective in initiating a bargaining period to which the employer and notifying union are negotiating parties. [17] (Emphasis added)
 
 Section 423(3) specifies how the bargaining period is initiated. Even if CSBP, as employer, is the only other person who can be a "negotiating party" to a bargaining period initiated by the LHMU in relation to CSBP employees in this case the LHMU gave "written notice ... to each other negotiating party and to the Commission stating that the initiating party intends to try to make a collective agreement to which this section applies ... with the other negotiating parties under ... 328" as required by s 423(3). The fact that the notice was also given to other persons as "negotiating parties" does not detract from the fact that the requirements of s 423(3) have been satisfied. [18]

24 The protected action ballot order made by Lawler VP was, according to counsel for the respondent, revoked upon the application of the respondent. A further application for a protected action ballot order was then made relying upon the Initiating Notice and came on for hearing before Commissioner Smith of the Commission on 2 March of this year. The Commissioner in an ex tempore decision made a protection action ballot order. The Commissioner's edited reasons were published on 8 March 2007: Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v CSBP Limited (PR976337) ("the second Commission case"). The points taken by the applicant before Lawler VP as to the invalidity of the Initiating Notice were re-argued before Commissioner Smith. In his reasons the Commissioner adopted, without more, the reasoning of Lawler VP, in the first Commission case, in finding that there was a valid bargaining period and in effect a valid initiating notice.

25 As of 23 March 2007, the applicant had reached agreement on all terms of a new workplace agreement with the respondent except in respect of "backpayment of allowances". As at 26 March those issues were resolved save for issues said to have been specific to chemicals.

26 As at 30 March 2007 the remaining issues concerned shift cover and chemical operator levels.

62 The applicant contended that:
 
 
 (i) protected industrial action can only occur during a bargaining period: ss 435(1) and (2). The Protected Action Notice indicates that employees will take industrial action "in respect of the notice of bargaining period BP 2007/8". The Initiating Notice was directed to 3 "other negotiating parties" (the applicant, the AMWU and CEPU) and stated that the respondent intended to try to make a collective agreement with the other negotiating parties. The particulars (at paragraph (b) of the Protected Action Notice) confirmed that the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period was one binding the applicant, the respondent, CEPU and AMWU; 
 


 
 
 (ii) there is no provision in the Act which allows a union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement. Where a union initiates a bargaining period the only other negotiating party is the employer: s 423(3) and (4). The ability to initiate a bargaining period with more than one union is confined to employers: s 423(4)(c). A defect of this kind is no mere technicality. The effect of a bargaining period is to modify existing legal rights. A union that is a negotiating party may take protected action: s 435(2). Severance is not possible because it will substantially alter the nature of the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period (as confirmed by the particulars). The inclusion of the CEPU and AMWU as "Other Negotiating Parties" was not a "slip". Both the particulars and the factual matrix in which the notice was served confirm that the respondent intended to negotiate an agreement with the applicant and the other 2 unions. The expired CSBP Agreement was an agreement between the applicant and the 3 unions and, since April 2006, the applicant and the 3 unions had been negotiating a new agreement to replace the expired agreement. Further, even if the references in the Initiating Notice to the AMWU and CEPU could be severed, it is seriously arguable that the notice would only then be valid so that a bargaining period would not come into effect for a further 7 days: s 427 of the Act ; 
 


 
 
 (iii) whereas a challenge to the validity of the Initiating Notice was rejected by Lawler VP in LHMU v CSBP Limited [2007] AIRC 112 , PR976150, at [17]-[18], and a similar challenge under the pre-reform Act was rejected by a Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU &amp; Anor , 21 June 2000, Print S7131 at [12], [14], [21]-[22], those decisions should not be followed. The point which arises in this case, and which was not addressed in those decisions, is not merely that the CEPU and AMWU have been erroneously named as negotiating parties in the respondent's notice. It is that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was particularised as, and was intended to be, an agreement between the respondent, the applicant and the CEPU and AMWU and that, by reason of s 423(4)(d) , a union cannot initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take protected industrial action in support of a multi-union agreement; 
 


 
 
 (iv) under s 435(2) of the Act , industrial action organised or engaged in during the bargaining period may be protected action but only if it is organised or engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of "the proposed collective agreement": s 435(2). The "proposed collective agreement" is that to which the bargaining period is directed [s 423(3)]: Trinity Garden Aged Care &amp; Anor v ANF , 21 August 2006, PR973718, at [43]. Accordingly, if the Initiating Notice is held to be valid, the result will be that the respondent will seemingly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the respondent to make an agreement with the respondent, the CEPU and the AMWU. Such an outcome is inconsistent with s 423(4)(d) which clearly evinces an intention that if a bargaining period is to be initiated in pursuit of a multi-union agreement (with the possibility that industrial action will then be taken in support of such an agreement), it must be initiated by the employer;

The fact that, in the present case, the applicant is prepared to negotiate a multi-union agreement is not to the point. What is at issue is the capacity of the respondent union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement; and

<tocase>Trinity Garden Aged Care &amp; Anor v ANF , 21 August 2006, PR973718</tocase>
<text>62 The applicant contended that:
 
 
 (i) protected industrial action can only occur during a bargaining period: ss 435(1) and (2). The Protected Action Notice indicates that employees will take industrial action "in respect of the notice of bargaining period BP 2007/8". The Initiating Notice was directed to 3 "other negotiating parties" (the applicant, the AMWU and CEPU) and stated that the respondent intended to try to make a collective agreement with the other negotiating parties. The particulars (at paragraph (b) of the Protected Action Notice) confirmed that the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period was one binding the applicant, the respondent, CEPU and AMWU; 
 


 
 
 (ii) there is no provision in the Act which allows a union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement. Where a union initiates a bargaining period the only other negotiating party is the employer: s 423(3) and (4). The ability to initiate a bargaining period with more than one union is confined to employers: s 423(4)(c). A defect of this kind is no mere technicality. The effect of a bargaining period is to modify existing legal rights. A union that is a negotiating party may take protected action: s 435(2). Severance is not possible because it will substantially alter the nature of the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period (as confirmed by the particulars). The inclusion of the CEPU and AMWU as "Other Negotiating Parties" was not a "slip". Both the particulars and the factual matrix in which the notice was served confirm that the respondent intended to negotiate an agreement with the applicant and the other 2 unions. The expired CSBP Agreement was an agreement between the applicant and the 3 unions and, since April 2006, the applicant and the 3 unions had been negotiating a new agreement to replace the expired agreement. Further, even if the references in the Initiating Notice to the AMWU and CEPU could be severed, it is seriously arguable that the notice would only then be valid so that a bargaining period would not come into effect for a further 7 days: s 427 of the Act ; 
 


 
 
 (iii) whereas a challenge to the validity of the Initiating Notice was rejected by Lawler VP in LHMU v CSBP Limited [2007] AIRC 112 , PR976150, at [17]-[18], and a similar challenge under the pre-reform Act was rejected by a Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU &amp; Anor , 21 June 2000, Print S7131 at [12], [14], [21]-[22], those decisions should not be followed. The point which arises in this case, and which was not addressed in those decisions, is not merely that the CEPU and AMWU have been erroneously named as negotiating parties in the respondent's notice. It is that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was particularised as, and was intended to be, an agreement between the respondent, the applicant and the CEPU and AMWU and that, by reason of s 423(4)(d) , a union cannot initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take protected industrial action in support of a multi-union agreement; 
 


 
 
 (iv) under s 435(2) of the Act , industrial action organised or engaged in during the bargaining period may be protected action but only if it is organised or engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of "the proposed collective agreement": s 435(2). The "proposed collective agreement" is that to which the bargaining period is directed [s 423(3)]: Trinity Garden Aged Care &amp; Anor v ANF , 21 August 2006, PR973718, at [43]. Accordingly, if the Initiating Notice is held to be valid, the result will be that the respondent will seemingly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the respondent to make an agreement with the respondent, the CEPU and the AMWU. Such an outcome is inconsistent with s 423(4)(d) which clearly evinces an intention that if a bargaining period is to be initiated in pursuit of a multi-union agreement (with the possibility that industrial action will then be taken in support of such an agreement), it must be initiated by the employer; 
 


 
 
 (v) the contrast with s 423(4)(c) , which expressly allows for more than one organisation to be a negotiating party where the initiating party is the employer, is telling. This is not a curious result. It is quite easy to envisage why Parliament would not have wished to give unions the ability to take industrial action to cause an employer to enter into a multi-union agreement, irrespective of the wishes of the employer. It is quite possible that Parliament considered the employer was best placed to determine whether a multi-union agreement was suited to the needs of the particular business and therefore that the employer should not be pressured into making a multi-union agreement if it did not wish to. The fact that, in the present case, the applicant is prepared to negotiate a multi-union agreement is not to the point. What is at issue is the capacity of the respondent union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement; and 
 


 
 
 (vi) if, as appears from s 435(2) , a union cannot initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi-union agreement, there is at least a serious question to be tried that the respondent's Initiating Notice was invalid such that no bargaining period was initiated and the proposed industrial action will be unprotected and unlawful.

76 In my opinion there is a serious question to be tried as to whether in the circumstances of this case, the Initiating Notice was valid. I am not immediately persuaded, although I make no decision in this regard, that the reasoning of Lawler VP to which I have referred is correct. In any event, as I earlier foreshadowed, his reasons do not deal with the point which has been raised by the applicant here, namely, whether the addition of the CEPU and the AMWU as negotiating parties were included advisedly in the Initiating Notice (not "incorrectly" as Lawler VP assumed) to the end that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was intended to be an agreement between the applicant, the respondent and each of the CEPU and the AMWU. This question in turn raises associated questions not dealt with in either the first Commission case or the second Commission case in any determinative way. These are firstly whether upon the proper construction of s 423(4)(b) of the Act a union can initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take industrial action in support of a multi-union agreement. Secondly there is the effect upon the validity of the Initiating Notice having regard to the provisions of s 435(2) of the Act which provides relevantly that during a bargaining period an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party is entitled, for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed collective agreement to organise or engage in industrial action against the employer. For the purposes of s 423(3) of the Act the "proposed collective agreement" is that to which the bargaining period is directed: Trinity Garden Aged Care v ANF, 21 August 2006, PR973718 at [43]. On one view, as the applicant submits, this would produce the result that the respondent would similarly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the applicant to make an agreement not merely with the respondent but with the respondent and each of the CEPU and AMWU.

77 In any event, whatever the position in relation to the question of issue estoppel as it may concern that particular challenge to the Initiating Notice, there was no issue at any time in the Commission concerning the validity of the Protected Action Notice nor could there have been for the obvious reason that this notice was not given until after the protected ballot order had been made by Commissioner Smith. I will now consider that question.

78 In the alternative, the applicant submits that even if there is a valid bargaining period in place there is a serious question to be tried that the Protected Action Notice given by the respondent on 30 March 2007, in purported compliance with s 441 of the Act , did not adequately state the nature of the intended action and was therefore not a valid notice.</text>

<tocase>Woodside Petroleum (WA Oil) Pty Ltd v AIMPE [2005] FCA 403</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/403.html</AustLII>
<text>84 The applicant relied upon Woodside Petroleum (WA Oil) Pty Ltd v AIMPE [2005] FCA 403 where a similar issue arose. The notice of intended industrial action served by the union in that case did not make clear whether employees would perform critical safety functions including monitoring of the power supply. The seriousness of the safety issues raised weighed heavily in the balance of convenience: [2005] FCA 403 at [16] - [17] . The applicant also referred the Court to Burswood Resort (Management) Ltd v ALHMWU [1999] FCA 1443 (Carr J) at [13]-[14] (serious question to be tried as to whether "stoppages of work" refers to some or all employees); Burswood Resort (Management) Ltd v CEPU [2004] FCA 909 (Nicholson J) at [12]-[14].

93 The appropriate defensive action referred to by von Doussa J in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd included, by way of example, the shutting down of a sophisticated item of equipment, although in the context of potential damage to the equipment if precipitately shut down. In this case, whatever be the consideration concerning damage to the plant, there are very substantial safety issues concerned both with the shutting down of the plant safely but also in monitoring the plant whilst it is shut down: see the Woodside Petroleum and Burswood Resort cases referred to above. Arguably the Protected Action Notice should have specified the Process Technicians, if any, who would be available for safety duties during the proposed period of the industrial action. Whilst, at the hearing, this safety issue was resolved, by agreement, that fact does not assist the respondent in relation to the question of the efficacy of the Protected Action Notice: a question which falls to be considered in light of the content of the Notice, unaffected by the agreement reached at the hearing before me.</text>
