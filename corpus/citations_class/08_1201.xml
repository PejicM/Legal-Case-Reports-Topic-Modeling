<text>25 The extraordinary nature of such relief was not put in issue by any of the parties or Citic Pacific. Nor could it be. In Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 754 at [9] , [1999] FCA 754 ; 46 IPR 159 at 161 Branson J cited with approval the following observations of Powell JA (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) in Long v Specifier Publications Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 545 at 547:
 Reduced to its essentials, an Anton Piller order is an order that the defendant to whom, or to which, it is directed, should permit the persons specified in the order to enter upon his, or its, premises, and to inspect, take copies of, and to remove, specified material, or classes of material, indicating, where appropriate, documents, articles or other forms of property. It is an extraordinary remedy, designed to obtain, and to preserve, vital evidence pending the final determination of the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings, in a case in which it can be shown that there is a high risk that, if forewarned, the defendant, would destroy, or hide, the evidence, or cause it to be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. For this reason, such orders are invariably made ex parte. 
Her Honour went on to observe:
 [26] ... The court must, in my view, be careful to avoid the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court to make an Anton Piller order from being subverted to a mere investigatory tool for applicants or indeed, from being used for any purpose other than the preservation of vital evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding.

Leave to appeal from that decision was refused: Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 270 , 63 IPR 373.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/886.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Order 15A provides for " Preliminary Discovery ". And again the rules contain limiting conditions: cf Airservices Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 , 92 FCR 200. Finn J there made the following observations as to the features of both rr 3 and 6 of O 15A:
 [5] I would emphasise at the outset the following features of these rules. First, while r 3 for obvious reasons allows discovery against a person whether or not that person is a possible respondent to the projected proceeding, the discovery available under r 6 is limited to discovery against the person who is the "prospective respondent". Secondly, as has been emphasised by judges of this Court, r 6 prescribes significant limiting conditions to be satisfied before an order can be made... An applicant who can satisfy them, is allowed "to fish" for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has a case against the prospective respondent... But preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves. It does not mandate mere rummaging through another's affairs. Thirdly, while an applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case for the purpose of satisfying the r 6(a) condition that he or she has reasonable cause to believe he or she has a right to obtain relief... an applicant will not necessarily be denied preliminary discovery because he or she "already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief"... Fourthly, an order for discovery under r 6 can properly be characterised as an interlocutory order... Fifthly, in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper [1999] FCA 169 ; (1999) 92 FCR 90 ; 161 ALR 447 Tamberlin J held that the provisions of O 15A do not infringe the constitutional requirement that for this Court to have jurisdiction in relation to a proceeding there must be a "matter". ... 
Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal dismissed: Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 , 96 FCR 1.</text>

<text>57 Provision, of course, is made in O 15 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules for the making of an order that a party give general discovery. The fundamental policy behind discovery is to ensure that litigation is decided upon the merits and that cases are not decided by ambush and surprise: Ammerlaan v Distillers Co (Bio-Chemicals) Ltd (1992) 58 SASR 164 at 173 per Olsson J. Such discovery as is ordered is a matter for the discretion of the Court. As a general rule the Court will not order a party to give general discovery: Kyocera Mita Australia Pty Ltd v Mitronics Corp Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 242 at [5] per Stone J. Subsequent to the amendments to this Court's Rules in 1999 and the promulgation of Practice Note 14 , discovery is normally limited to the circumstances of a particular case.</text>

<text>28 In that context, it is considered that the discretion to allow an applicant to inspect seized documents may be exercised to permit:
 
(a) an assessment to be made as to whether or not there has been compliance with the order as made and (possibly) whether any further order pursuant to O 25B may be warranted; 
 
(b) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do or may provide evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding; and
 
(c) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do not provide such evidence so that those documents may be returned.
 
And, in identifying those documents which should be preserved pending the final hearing and determination of a proceeding:
 
(d) the search is not limited to those documents directly related to the precise cause of action then known: cf Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 862 at [6] [7] per Allsop J; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707 at [4] per Jacobson J.
 
There may well be other reasons for granting leave to an applicant to inspect seized documents. All of the purposes identified, however, have one thing in common -- they allow the documents which have been seized to be inspected in order to ensure that the search order has been complied with and to ensure that only evidence which should be preserved is in fact preserved pending the final determination of a proceeding.</text>

39 No submission was advanced on behalf of the Applicants contrary to the importance attached by the common law to protecting the privacy of individuals. Their submission was that the primacy attached to the administration of justice extended to conferring authority to access the materials as an adjunct to the discovery process. This contention was said by the Applicants to have been resolved by Jacobson J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707. An order pursuant to O 25B in that proceeding had previously been made by Allsop J (as he then was). Consent orders were made on 7 September 2006 which provided for inspection by the Applicants and their solicitors.</text>

<text>37 Although there may be no enforceable right to privacy presently recognised in Australian law (cf Australian Broadcasting Corp v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 , 208 CLR 199) , such compulsory powers of search and seizure as are conferred by both Commonwealth and State legislation should not be construed as authorising any greater intrusion into the private affairs of individuals than is unambiguously authorised.</text>

<text>33 Order 25 is likewise confined to the making of interim orders. Order 25 r 2, in particular, is confined to the making of orders as to the " preservation of property ". Those seeking orders pursuant to that rule do not need to satisfy the more onerous requirements imposed by O 25B: Authors Workshop v Bileru Pty Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 211 at 215 per Lockhart J.

34 It is considered that it is no part of the object or purpose of those provisions to facilitate the discovery processes otherwise authorised by the Rules or to facilitate the provision of further particulars . To construe those provisions as extending to such a purpose would erode both the importance attached by the common law to protecting the privacy of individuals and the constraints otherwise imposed by the Rules upon the discovery process.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/415.html</AustLII>
<text>47 The Federal Court Rules , however, were amended in 1999 with the intent of confining the ambit of documents to be discovered: Salim v Loh (No 2) [2005] FCA 1417. French J there summarised the position as follows:
 [3] The 1999 amendments to the Rules, which introduced the new O 15 r 2, manifested '... a quite new and restrictive policy in relation to the discovery to be allowed' in the Federal Court -- South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd [2000] FCA 519 per Finn J. The rule that the discovery obligation covered documents that did no more than relate in some way to a matter in issue or that might lead to a train of inquiry has been abolished. The categories required to be discovered under O 15 r 2(3) include documents that support or adversely affect another party's case or that adversely affect a party's own case. They do not extend to documents that might support or adversely affect a party's case. The search obligation is limited to 'reasonable search'. 
Similarly, in Aveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 Lindgren J observed: 
 [10] The question arises: what are the principles which should guide the parties in identifying categories? They are the principles which guide the Court when ordering discovery. In ACCC v Advanced Medical Institute [[2005] FCA 366] , I attempted to explain (at [19] -- [21]) that rule amendments and Practice Note 14 (Discovery) of 1999 were intended to establish a r&eacute;gime under which discovery is more confined than it was under the former Peruvian Guano test (cf The Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55). Practice Note 14 para 3 states: 
 
 To prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case, orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by Order 15 rule 2(3).
 
 

Consistent with the more confined extent of discovery which is required, the Federal Court Rules now confer an express power to limit discovery and to make orders " necessary to prevent unnecessary discovery ": O 15 r 3(2).</text>

<text>49 The power conferred by O 25B is expressed to be " for the purpose of securing or preserving evidence ". The purpose, not surprisingly, is not confined to securing only that material which may thereafter be discoverable. But, to enable a party to obtain an order pursuant to O 25B and thereafter permit that party to " rummage through " the materials seized, in order to make an assessment as to those documents which that party considers would be or should be discoverable, would defeat the perimeters within which discovery is to be made by a party, especially the more confined and restricted extent of discovery which this Court now permits. It would also endorse a course which courts have properly shunned, namely a course of improperly permitting the relief authorised by O 25B to become an " investigatory tool " ( Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 754 at [26] , [1999] FCA 754 ; 46 IPR 159 at 164 per Branson J; Bugaj v Bates [2004] FCA 1260 at [13] per Stone J) or a preliminary step that later facilitates such an investigation.</text>

<tocase>Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001 , 155 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1001.html</AustLII>
<text>62 In consenting to an order requiring general discovery, it is not understood that the parties are merely consenting to an order requiring the discovery of only those documents as are contemplated by O 15 r 2(3): Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001 at [153] , [2006] FCA 1001 ; 155 FCR 1 at 22 3 per Collier J. It is understood that the parties are consenting to what was described by Beaumont J as an order in the " traditional form " requiring discovery of those documents which " may " -- not " must " -- either directly or indirectly enable a party to advance its own case or damage that of his adversary: Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109. Beaumont J there observed:
 [64] In their traditional form, rules of court required, under a general discovery order, that the party disclose any document in its possession, custody or control "relating to any matter in question" in the proceeding; that is to say, any document which may -- not which must -- either directly, or indirectly, enable the party requiring the discovery either to advance its own case, or to damage the case of its adversary, or which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may have either of those two consequences (see, eg Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62 63). 

 [65] The nature and extent of disclosure, in terms of the adjectival "relevance" of documents for the purposes of a general order for discovery in its traditional form is explained in Halsbury's Laws of England 4th ed, Vol 13 at [38] to the following effect: 

 &#8226; So long as they are likely to throw light on the case, documents "relate to a matter in question", whether or not admissible in evidence. &#8226; A document may be "relevant" for discovery purposes by reason of its character (ie it is a document of a particular type); or by reason of its contents. &#8226; Discovery will not be ordered in respect of an allegation not made in the pleadings or particulars, nor will discovery be allowed to enable a party to "fish" for witnesses, or for a new case, ie to enable the party to frame a new case. &#8226; Each case must be considered according to the issues raised; but where there are numerous documents of slight relevance and it would be oppressive to produce them all, some limitations may be imposed. [66] The foregoing is also an accurate description of Australian practice and procedure (see, generally, Commonwealth of Australia v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 23 24). 

 [67] Under a traditional general discovery order, the following methods are available to obtain further disclosure where a party seeks to show that "relevant" documents have been omitted from the list: (1) It may require verification of the list; (2) It may apply for a further and better list, whether verified or not, either in general terms, or limited to certain classes of documents. (The power to order a further and better list is parallel with, and may be combined with, the court's power, on application, to order the disclosure of particulars of specific documents.); (3) It may apply for an affidavit as to specific documents or classes of documents; (4) In certain special circumstances, it may apply for leave to interrogate as to particular documents (Halsbury, op. cit. at [48]). 

 
His Honour there further observed that:
 [70] ... where, extraordinarily, the Court judges that it is, in the particular circumstances, appropriate to order general discovery, in the absence of any special (ad hoc) restriction, the traditional (broad) obligation to discover any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding will continue to apply. 
It is this " traditional (broad) obligation " which has been relied upon as a discretionary reason -- should it be a matter for discretion -- to confine the tasks to be pursued by the Applicants' solicitors in their review of the seized documents.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/94.html</AustLII>
<text>35 As a matter of principle, the common law has long been " jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions ": George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104. Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ were there addressing s 679 of The Criminal Code (Qld) which authorised the issue of a search warrant and observed at 110 11:
 A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof. The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property. Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. In enacting s 679, the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law, vol 10 (1938), pp 668 672. Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods, the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier: Leach v Money [(1765) 19 State Tr 1001] ; Entick v Carrington [(1765) 19 State Tr 1029]. Historically, the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property: Entick [(1765) 19 State Tr, at p 1066]. In modern times, the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy: see Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure (1986), pp 1 2. State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position, and s 679 is a far-reaching one. Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. ... 
The importance of the rights protected by the common law has likewise been repeatedly recognised by all courts, including this Court: eg, Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Oke [2007] FCAFC 94 at [36] [37], 159 FCR 441 at 448 per Branson and Lindgren JJ (Besanko J agreeing at [47]); Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 at [66] , [2002] FCAFC 392 ; 124 FCR 384 at 400 per French, Sackville and Nicholson JJ.

<text>46 The traditional test for discovery, it will be recalled, was expressed in part in terms of whether a document would lead to a " train of enquiry " which could advance a party's case or damage that of his opponent: Mulley &amp; Marney v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. Menzies J there observed at 345:
 I now turn to the pleadings to determine what are the matters at issue between the parties, because discovery is a procedure directed towards obtaining a proper examination and determination of these issues--not towards assisting a party upon a fishing expedition. Only a document which relates in some way to a matter in issue is discoverable, but it is sufficient if it would, or would lead to a train of enquiry which would, either advance a party's own case or damage that of his adversary. 
See also: Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55.

47 The Federal Court Rules , however, were amended in 1999 with the intent of confining the ambit of documents to be discovered: Salim v Loh (No 2) [2005] FCA 1417. French J there summarised the position as follows:

It is understood that the parties are consenting to what was described by Beaumont J as an order in the " traditional form " requiring discovery of those documents which " may " -- not " must " -- either directly or indirectly enable a party to advance its own case or damage that of his adversary: Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109. Beaumont J there observed:
 [64] In their traditional form, rules of court required, under a general discovery order, that the party disclose any document in its possession, custody or control "relating to any matter in question" in the proceeding; that is to say, any document which may -- not which must -- either directly, or indirectly, enable the party requiring the discovery either to advance its own case, or to damage the case of its adversary, or which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may have either of those two consequences (see, eg Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62 63). 

 [65] The nature and extent of disclosure, in terms of the adjectival "relevance" of documents for the purposes of a general order for discovery in its traditional form is explained in Halsbury's Laws of England 4th ed, Vol 13 at [38] to the following effect: 

 &#8226; So long as they are likely to throw light on the case, documents "relate to a matter in question", whether or not admissible in evidence. &#8226; A document may be "relevant" for discovery purposes by reason of its character (ie it is a document of a particular type); or by reason of its contents. &#8226; Discovery will not be ordered in respect of an allegation not made in the pleadings or particulars, nor will discovery be allowed to enable a party to "fish" for witnesses, or for a new case, ie to enable the party to frame a new case. &#8226; Each case must be considered according to the issues raised; but where there are numerous documents of slight relevance and it would be oppressive to produce them all, some limitations may be imposed. [66] The foregoing is also an accurate description of Australian practice and procedure (see, generally, Commonwealth of Australia v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 23 24). 

 [67] Under a traditional general discovery order, the following methods are available to obtain further disclosure where a party seeks to show that "relevant" documents have been omitted from the list: (1) It may require verification of the list; (2) It may apply for a further and better list, whether verified or not, either in general terms, or limited to certain classes of documents. (The power to order a further and better list is parallel with, and may be combined with, the court's power, on application, to order the disclosure of particulars of specific documents.); (3) It may apply for an affidavit as to specific documents or classes of documents; (4) In certain special circumstances, it may apply for leave to interrogate as to particular documents (Halsbury, op. cit. at [48]). 

 
His Honour there further observed that:
 [70] ... where, extraordinarily, the Court judges that it is, in the particular circumstances, appropriate to order general discovery, in the absence of any special (ad hoc) restriction, the traditional (broad) obligation to discover any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding will continue to apply. 
It is this " traditional (broad) obligation " which has been relied upon as a discretionary reason -- should it be a matter for discretion -- to confine the tasks to be pursued by the Applicants' solicitors in their review of the seized documents.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/26.html</AustLII>
<text>35 As a matter of principle, the common law has long been " jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions ": George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104. Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ were there addressing s 679 of The Criminal Code (Qld) which authorised the issue of a search warrant and observed at 110 11:
 A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof. The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property. Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. In enacting s 679, the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law, vol 10 (1938), pp 668 672. Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods, the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier: Leach v Money [(1765) 19 State Tr 1001] ; Entick v Carrington [(1765) 19 State Tr 1029]. Historically, the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property: Entick [(1765) 19 State Tr, at p 1066]. In modern times, the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy: see Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure (1986), pp 1 2. State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position, and s 679 is a far-reaching one. Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. ... 
The importance of the rights protected by the common law has likewise been repeatedly recognised by all courts, including this Court: eg, Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Oke [2007] FCAFC 94 at [36] [37], 159 FCR 441 at 448 per Branson and Lindgren JJ (Besanko J agreeing at [47]); Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 at [66] , [2002] FCAFC 392 ; 124 FCR 384 at 400 per French, Sackville and Nicholson JJ.

<text>38 In some circumstances there may be a " tension " between common law privileges and " the efficient exercise of statutory powers ": Halliday v Nevill [1984] HCA 80 ; (1984) 155 CLR 1 at 20 per Brennan J; New South Wales v Corbett [2007] HCA 32 at [16] [22], [2007] HCA 32 ; 230 CLR 606 at 610 12 per Kirby J. Not in the context of the exercise of statutory powers facilitating the investigation of criminal offences, but rather in the context of construing that which is permitted by O 25B of the Federal Court Rules , there is not considered to be any such " tension ". The convenience of the position being advocated by the Applicants may well be understandable, but it is not a sufficient reason to depart from the importance accorded by the common law to an individual's right to preserve the privacy and confidentiality of his own documents. The interests in the administration of justice should not be understated or minimised; but those interests are adequately served by the preservation of the documents and materials properly seized.</text>

<text>48 Order 15A provides for " Preliminary Discovery ". And again the rules contain limiting conditions: cf Airservices Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 , 92 FCR 200. Finn J there made the following observations as to the features of both rr 3 and 6 of O 15A:
 [5] I would emphasise at the outset the following features of these rules. First, while r 3 for obvious reasons allows discovery against a person whether or not that person is a possible respondent to the projected proceeding, the discovery available under r 6 is limited to discovery against the person who is the "prospective respondent". Secondly, as has been emphasised by judges of this Court, r 6 prescribes significant limiting conditions to be satisfied before an order can be made... An applicant who can satisfy them, is allowed "to fish" for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has a case against the prospective respondent... But preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves. It does not mandate mere rummaging through another's affairs. Thirdly, while an applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case for the purpose of satisfying the r 6(a) condition that he or she has reasonable cause to believe he or she has a right to obtain relief... an applicant will not necessarily be denied preliminary discovery because he or she "already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief"... Fourthly, an order for discovery under r 6 can properly be characterised as an interlocutory order... Fifthly, in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper [1999] FCA 169 ; (1999) 92 FCR 90 ; 161 ALR 447 Tamberlin J held that the provisions of O 15A do not infringe the constitutional requirement that for this Court to have jurisdiction in relation to a proceeding there must be a "matter". ...

<text>57 Provision, of course, is made in O 15 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules for the making of an order that a party give general discovery. The fundamental policy behind discovery is to ensure that litigation is decided upon the merits and that cases are not decided by ambush and surprise: Ammerlaan v Distillers Co (Bio-Chemicals) Ltd (1992) 58 SASR 164 at 173 per Olsson J. Such discovery as is ordered is a matter for the discretion of the Court. As a general rule the Court will not order a party to give general discovery: Kyocera Mita Australia Pty Ltd v Mitronics Corp Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 242 at [5] per Stone J. Subsequent to the amendments to this Court's Rules in 1999 and the promulgation of Practice Note 14 , discovery is normally limited to the circumstances of a particular case.</text>

The decision does not stand as authority for the proposition that seized documents (in the absence of consent) may be inspected as an adjunct to the discovery process or to facilitate the provision of particulars. It is simply a decision as to what may be seized and, once seized, what may be looked for when inspecting those documents. Neither of the other decisions cited by the Respondents in this proceeding -- Remath Investments No 6 Pty Ltd v Savi World Transport Pty Ltd &amp; Fraser (Unreported, VSC, Byrne J, 12 November 1997) and Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott [2004] VSC 414 -- provide further assistance.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/637.html</AustLII>
<text>68 The Respondents, by their Notice of Motion , seek the return of all documents seized and, it may safely be assumed, do not consent to any further inspection occurring. They may wish to reconsider their position, as may the Applicants, in light of the conclusions reached as to the limits of the right of inspection permitted by the Federal Court Rules . It may be noted that in Lifetime Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 637 an order was made for the return of documents to the solicitor of a party apparently " to facilitate completion of discovery " .

69 Subject to the return of those documents which have no continuing relevance to the proceeding, it is not however considered that the remaining documents seized should be returned -- at least at this stage. No case has sought to be advanced by those from whom the documents were seized that the continued retention of those documents is causing them any inconvenience or prejudice. In the absence of any such contention, and notwithstanding the fact that a copy of the documents seized remains available to the Court, it is presently considered that the documents seized should remain available pending the resolution of the proceeding.

70 Pursuant to the terms of the orders made, records have also been kept of those who have inspected the seized documents and materials. Citic Pacific should be provided with a copy of those records that disclose the identity of those officers of the Applicants who have been given access to documents seized and the documents in fact inspected (if any).</text>

<text>25 The extraordinary nature of such relief was not put in issue by any of the parties or Citic Pacific. Nor could it be. In Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 754 at [9] , [1999] FCA 754 ; 46 IPR 159 at 161 Branson J cited with approval the following observations of Powell JA (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) in Long v Specifier Publications Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 545 at 547:
 Reduced to its essentials, an Anton Piller order is an order that the defendant to whom, or to which, it is directed, should permit the persons specified in the order to enter upon his, or its, premises, and to inspect, take copies of, and to remove, specified material, or classes of material, indicating, where appropriate, documents, articles or other forms of property. It is an extraordinary remedy, designed to obtain, and to preserve, vital evidence pending the final determination of the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings, in a case in which it can be shown that there is a high risk that, if forewarned, the defendant, would destroy, or hide, the evidence, or cause it to be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. For this reason, such orders are invariably made ex parte. 
Her Honour went on to observe:
 [26] ... The court must, in my view, be careful to avoid the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court to make an Anton Piller order from being subverted to a mere investigatory tool for applicants or indeed, from being used for any purpose other than the preservation of vital evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2093.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The search orders as made ex parte on 11 December 2007 ( Metso Minerals v Kalra [2007] FCA 2093) were executed on 12, 13 and 14 December 2007.

4 The persons against whom those orders were executed were the then Respondents, namely the First to Fourth Respondents. The " documents and materials " which were authorised to be seized were identified as being:
 1. works recording, containing or including 'Plans for the building of grinding mills' and any other plans or other documentation which relates to the crushing, grinding or screening of materials which can be reasonably ascertained to have been created by or for Metso Minerals (Australia) Limited ACN 000 197 428 and/or Metso Minerals Industries, Inc including the documents listed in the table at paragraph 3 below; 2. works recording, containing or including 'Calculations for the building of grinding mills' and any other any other plans or other documentation which relates to the calculations for the crushing, grinding or screening of materials which can be reasonably ascertained to have been created by or for Metso Minerals (Australia) Limited and/or Metso Minerals Industries, Inc including the documents listed in the table at paragraph 3 below; [The "table" referred to identified documents being mainly drawings]. 4. E-Mails and correspondence between any one or more of the respondents and any other person, corporation or entity attaching copies of the works in paragraphs 1 2 above or otherwise referring to them. 5. Copies or parts of the Documents and Materials listed above.

19 The Amended Statement of Claim as now filed is a lengthy document which essentially pleads four causes of action, being:
 
(a) breach of an equitable duty of confidence;
 
(b) breach by the First, Second, Third and Fourth Respondents of employment consultancy agreements and confidentiality agreements;
 
(c) breach of fiduciary duty by the First Respondent; and
 
(d) infringement of copyright by all Respondents.
 
As recounted in the reasons for decision when first making the order under O 25B ( Metso Minerals v Kalra [2007] FCA 2093) , the First and Second Respondents were former employees of the First Applicant, Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd. The Third Respondent was a contractor to the First Applicant and employed the Fourth Respondent. When making the order, the case being advanced against the Respondents was that there had been a breach of the duties and the agreements now pleaded. The Respondents were said to now be employed with the " Citic Group of companies ", a competitor of the Applicants. The Fifth Respondent is said to be a company under the control of the First Respondent, Mr Kalra.

20 The search order as first made and as subsequently varied, the Respondents maintain, was relevantly made in advance of the detailed Amended Statement of Claim being filed and the Defences being filed. Those pleadings, they contend, define the ambit of the dispute between the parties and the ambit of evidence relevant or potentially relevant to the resolution of that dispute.

21 The Applicants want to continue to access the materials seized as an aid to the discovery process and in order to be able to further particularise their claims. Although not expressed in these terms, the application is presumably an application for leave to inspect (or to continue to inspect) the documents as envisaged by Practice Note 24 . Leave to continue to inspect the seized documents for the purposes identified is said by the Applicants to be desirable " in the interests of the administration of justice " and as a means to promote good " case management ".</text>

<tocase>Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd v Kalra (No 2) [2007] FCA 2108</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2108.html</AustLII>
<text>5 Once the materials and documents had been seized, the order was thereafter first varied, with the consent of those from whom the materials had been seized, on 14 December 2007 ( Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd v Kalra (No 2) [2007] FCA 2108). By consent, the parties' legal representatives were granted photocopy access to the hard copies of documents seized. Various other orders were thereafter made by consent in February and March 2008, including orders extending the time for reporting by the independent solicitor.

6 On 1 April 2008 the Applicants sought to further vary the orders made. A contested hearing followed. On 3 April 2008 orders were made that, relevantly, permitted the Applicants' solicitors to disclose documents to named officers of the Applicants. It was that variation which prompted the intervention in the proceeding of Citic Pacific on 4 April 2008. That company claimed that amongst the materials seized were documents which they believed may have contained their own documents, being documents which they believed may well have been commercially confidential and possibly privileged. The access regime, as varied, was consequently suspended.

7 Given the description of the " documents and materials " to be seized, such a contention was perhaps unexpected. Certainly when initially making the order, there then was no reason to believe that such documents as would be seized would potentially include the documents of Citic Pacific (or related entities). The very description of the documents and materials that were the subject of the order was an attempt to confine the seizure of materials to those belonging to the Applicants, being materials that improperly remained in the possession of their former employees and contractor, the then Respondents. The seizure of any documents and materials falling outside of the terms of the order obviously would not have been authorised.

26 As occurred in the present proceeding, where there is no longer a basis for believing that documents may be destroyed, O 25B cannot then be invoked as the source of a power to vary orders previously made. Thereafter, if those orders are to be varied, recourse must be had to O 25 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd v Kalra (No 2) [2007] FCA 2108.

27 It was not disputed by any of the parties, or Citic Pacific, that leave may be granted to the Applicants to inspect the seized documents. But, other than the Applicants' submission that leave should be granted because it is necessary (or desirable) in the " interests of the administration of justice " -- and other than the competing submission that the Applicants should not be given leave to pursue inspection for the purposes relied upon -- none of the parties (or Citic Pacific) attempted to identify less controversial considerations relevant to the exercise of the discretion. The identification of such considerations may throw some light upon the outer limits of the discretion and how it is to be exercised.</text>

49 The power conferred by O 25B is expressed to be " for the purpose of securing or preserving evidence ". The purpose, not surprisingly, is not confined to securing only that material which may thereafter be discoverable. But, to enable a party to obtain an order pursuant to O 25B and thereafter permit that party to " rummage through " the materials seized, in order to make an assessment as to those documents which that party considers would be or should be discoverable, would defeat the perimeters within which discovery is to be made by a party, especially the more confined and restricted extent of discovery which this Court now permits. It would also endorse a course which courts have properly shunned, namely a course of improperly permitting the relief authorised by O 25B to become an " investigatory tool " ( Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 754 at [26] , [1999] FCA 754 ; 46 IPR 159 at 164 per Branson J; Bugaj v Bates [2004] FCA 1260 at [13] per Stone J) or a preliminary step that later facilitates such an investigation.</text>

<text>46 The traditional test for discovery, it will be recalled, was expressed in part in terms of whether a document would lead to a " train of enquiry " which could advance a party's case or damage that of his opponent: Mulley &amp; Marney v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. Menzies J there observed at 345:
 I now turn to the pleadings to determine what are the matters at issue between the parties, because discovery is a procedure directed towards obtaining a proper examination and determination of these issues--not towards assisting a party upon a fishing expedition. Only a document which relates in some way to a matter in issue is discoverable, but it is sufficient if it would, or would lead to a train of enquiry which would, either advance a party's own case or damage that of his adversary.

<text>38 In some circumstances there may be a " tension " between common law privileges and " the efficient exercise of statutory powers ": Halliday v Nevill [1984] HCA 80 ; (1984) 155 CLR 1 at 20 per Brennan J; New South Wales v Corbett [2007] HCA 32 at [16] [22], [2007] HCA 32 ; 230 CLR 606 at 610 12 per Kirby J. Not in the context of the exercise of statutory powers facilitating the investigation of criminal offences, but rather in the context of construing that which is permitted by O 25B of the Federal Court Rules , there is not considered to be any such " tension ". The convenience of the position being advocated by the Applicants may well be understandable, but it is not a sufficient reason to depart from the importance accorded by the common law to an individual's right to preserve the privacy and confidentiality of his own documents. The interests in the administration of justice should not be understated or minimised; but those interests are adequately served by the preservation of the documents and materials properly seized.</text>

<tocase>Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/109.html</AustLII>
<text>62 In consenting to an order requiring general discovery, it is not understood that the parties are merely consenting to an order requiring the discovery of only those documents as are contemplated by O 15 r 2(3): Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001 at [153] , [2006] FCA 1001 ; 155 FCR 1 at 22 3 per Collier J. It is understood that the parties are consenting to what was described by Beaumont J as an order in the " traditional form " requiring discovery of those documents which " may " -- not " must " -- either directly or indirectly enable a party to advance its own case or damage that of his adversary: Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109. Beaumont J there observed:
 [64] In their traditional form, rules of court required, under a general discovery order, that the party disclose any document in its possession, custody or control "relating to any matter in question" in the proceeding; that is to say, any document which may -- not which must -- either directly, or indirectly, enable the party requiring the discovery either to advance its own case, or to damage the case of its adversary, or which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may have either of those two consequences (see, eg Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62 63). 

 [65] The nature and extent of disclosure, in terms of the adjectival "relevance" of documents for the purposes of a general order for discovery in its traditional form is explained in Halsbury's Laws of England 4th ed, Vol 13 at [38] to the following effect: 

 &#8226; So long as they are likely to throw light on the case, documents "relate to a matter in question", whether or not admissible in evidence. &#8226; A document may be "relevant" for discovery purposes by reason of its character (ie it is a document of a particular type); or by reason of its contents. &#8226; Discovery will not be ordered in respect of an allegation not made in the pleadings or particulars, nor will discovery be allowed to enable a party to "fish" for witnesses, or for a new case, ie to enable the party to frame a new case. &#8226; Each case must be considered according to the issues raised; but where there are numerous documents of slight relevance and it would be oppressive to produce them all, some limitations may be imposed. [66] The foregoing is also an accurate description of Australian practice and procedure (see, generally, Commonwealth of Australia v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 23 24). 

 [67] Under a traditional general discovery order, the following methods are available to obtain further disclosure where a party seeks to show that "relevant" documents have been omitted from the list: (1) It may require verification of the list; (2) It may apply for a further and better list, whether verified or not, either in general terms, or limited to certain classes of documents. (The power to order a further and better list is parallel with, and may be combined with, the court's power, on application, to order the disclosure of particulars of specific documents.); (3) It may apply for an affidavit as to specific documents or classes of documents; (4) In certain special circumstances, it may apply for leave to interrogate as to particular documents (Halsbury, op. cit. at [48]). 

 
His Honour there further observed that:
 [70] ... where, extraordinarily, the Court judges that it is, in the particular circumstances, appropriate to order general discovery, in the absence of any special (ad hoc) restriction, the traditional (broad) obligation to discover any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding will continue to apply. 
It is this " traditional (broad) obligation " which has been relied upon as a discretionary reason -- should it be a matter for discretion -- to confine the tasks to be pursued by the Applicants' solicitors in their review of the seized documents.</text>

<text>43 But that, it is respectfully considered, is all that His Honour decided. The decision does not stand as authority for the proposition that seized documents (in the absence of consent) may be inspected as an adjunct to the discovery process or to facilitate the provision of particulars. It is simply a decision as to what may be seized and, once seized, what may be looked for when inspecting those documents. Neither of the other decisions cited by the Respondents in this proceeding -- Remath Investments No 6 Pty Ltd v Savi World Transport Pty Ltd &amp; Fraser (Unreported, VSC, Byrne J, 12 November 1997) and Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott [2004] VSC 414 -- provide further assistance.

<text>35 As a matter of principle, the common law has long been " jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions ": George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104. Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ were there addressing s 679 of The Criminal Code (Qld) which authorised the issue of a search warrant and observed at 110 11:
 A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof. The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property. Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. In enacting s 679, the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law, vol 10 (1938), pp 668 672. Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods, the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier: Leach v Money [(1765) 19 State Tr 1001] ; Entick v Carrington [(1765) 19 State Tr 1029]. Historically, the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property: Entick [(1765) 19 State Tr, at p 1066]. In modern times, the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy: see Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure (1986), pp 1 2. State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position, and s 679 is a far-reaching one. Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. ... 
The importance of the rights protected by the common law has likewise been repeatedly recognised by all courts, including this Court: eg, Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Oke [2007] FCAFC 94 at [36] [37], 159 FCR 441 at 448 per Branson and Lindgren JJ (Besanko J agreeing at [47]); Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 at [66] , [2002] FCAFC 392 ; 124 FCR 384 at 400 per French, Sackville and Nicholson JJ.

<tocase>Salim v Loh (No 2) [2005] FCA 1417</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1417.html</AustLII>
<text>47 The Federal Court Rules , however, were amended in 1999 with the intent of confining the ambit of documents to be discovered: Salim v Loh (No 2) [2005] FCA 1417. French J there summarised the position as follows:
 [3] The 1999 amendments to the Rules, which introduced the new O 15 r 2, manifested '... a quite new and restrictive policy in relation to the discovery to be allowed' in the Federal Court -- South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd [2000] FCA 519 per Finn J. The rule that the discovery obligation covered documents that did no more than relate in some way to a matter in issue or that might lead to a train of inquiry has been abolished. The categories required to be discovered under O 15 r 2(3) include documents that support or adversely affect another party's case or that adversely affect a party's own case. They do not extend to documents that might support or adversely affect a party's case. The search obligation is limited to 'reasonable search'. 
Similarly, in Aveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 Lindgren J observed: 
 [10] The question arises: what are the principles which should guide the parties in identifying categories? They are the principles which guide the Court when ordering discovery. In ACCC v Advanced Medical Institute [[2005] FCA 366] , I attempted to explain (at [19] -- [21]) that rule amendments and Practice Note 14 (Discovery) of 1999 were intended to establish a r&eacute;gime under which discovery is more confined than it was under the former Peruvian Guano test (cf The Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55). Practice Note 14 para 3 states: 
 
 To prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case, orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by Order 15 rule 2(3).
 
 

Consistent with the more confined extent of discovery which is required, the Federal Court Rules now confer an express power to limit discovery and to make orders " necessary to prevent unnecessary discovery ": O 15 r 3(2).</text>

<text>25 The extraordinary nature of such relief was not put in issue by any of the parties or Citic Pacific. Nor could it be. In Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 754 at [9] , [1999] FCA 754 ; 46 IPR 159 at 161 Branson J cited with approval the following observations of Powell JA (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) in Long v Specifier Publications Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 545 at 547:
 Reduced to its essentials, an Anton Piller order is an order that the defendant to whom, or to which, it is directed, should permit the persons specified in the order to enter upon his, or its, premises, and to inspect, take copies of, and to remove, specified material, or classes of material, indicating, where appropriate, documents, articles or other forms of property. It is an extraordinary remedy, designed to obtain, and to preserve, vital evidence pending the final determination of the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings, in a case in which it can be shown that there is a high risk that, if forewarned, the defendant, would destroy, or hide, the evidence, or cause it to be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. For this reason, such orders are invariably made ex parte. 
Her Honour went on to observe:
 [26] ... The court must, in my view, be careful to avoid the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court to make an Anton Piller order from being subverted to a mere investigatory tool for applicants or indeed, from being used for any purpose other than the preservation of vital evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding.

<tocase>Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben [1992] 1 WLR 840</tocase>
<text>15 Practice Note 24 stresses the importance of the role played by the " independent solicitor " and the qualified right of access of an applicant to the documents seized. It thus provides in part as follows:
 11. The independent solicitor is an important safeguard against abuse of the order. The independent solicitor must not be a member or employee of the applicant's firm of solicitors. The independent solicitor should be a solicitor experienced in commercial litigation... 12. Ordinarily, the applicant is not permitted, without the leave of the Court, to inspect things removed from the premises or copies of them, or to be given any information about them by members of the search party. 
The importance of the role potentially to be played by an " independent solicitor " with appropriate experience has long been recognised, eg Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben [1992] 1 WLR 840 at 861 per Nicholls VC. And, as Practice Note 24 makes clear, the applicant is not to inspect the seized documents " without the leave of the Court ".

16 What is not set forth in Practice Note 24 , and perhaps not surprisingly, is the basis upon which leave may be given. The bases upon which leave may be given should perhaps not be confined. Much may depend upon the circumstances of an individual case and much may also depend upon the precision with which the documents and materials that are authorised to be seized can be identified at the outset. Certainly, Practice Note 24 does not seek to confine the bases upon which leave may be granted or the purpose to be achieved in granting an applicant access to seized documents.

17 When the order was first made pursuant to O 25B, there had previously been filed an Application on 10 December 2007. A Statement of Claim was first filed on 22 April 2008. Again, in retrospect, directions should have been made for the filing of a Statement of Claim at a far earlier date. A specification by Senior Counsel for the Applicants of the proposed causes of action (albeit a fairly detailed exposition), should not have been endorsed by the Court as an appropriate way to proceed.</text>
