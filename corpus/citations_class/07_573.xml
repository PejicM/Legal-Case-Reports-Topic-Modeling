<text>87 The doctrine of restitution lies in the principle that a party should be restored to the position it was in prior to the payment of money leading to the unjust enrichment of another party. Unjust enrichment may arise in a variety of ways (see: Muschinski v Dodds [1985] HCA 78 ; (1985) 160 CLR 583; Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 at 378-379; National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Limited v Batty [1986] HCA 21 ; (1986) 160 CLR 251 at 268; Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344 at 359; Pavey &amp; Matthews Proprietary Limited v Paul [1987] HCA 5 ; (1987) 162 CLR 221 at 227) including total failure of consideration (see: Rowland v Divall [1923] 2 KB 500), or as a result of unconscionable conduct (see: Roxborough and Others v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Limited [2001] HCA 68 ; (2001) 208 CLR 516 per Gummow J at [70]- [71]).</text>

<tocase>Brown and Another v Jam Factory Pty Ltd (1981) 53 FLR 340 at 348</tocase>
<text>44 Division 1 of Part V of the Act provides a general prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct of corporations in trade and commerce. A breach of this section can result in an order of damages under s 82 of the Act. The characteristics of statements which constitute representations in breach of s 52 of the Act have been considered in numerous decisions, see: Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation and Another (1990) ATPR 40-994 at 50,950; (1989) 16 IPR 431; Brown and Another v Jam Factory Pty Ltd (1981) 53 FLR 340 at 348; Henjo Investments Pty Limited and Others v Collins Marrickville Pty Limited (No 1) (1988) 39 FCR 546; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Proprietary Limited v Puxu Proprietary Limited [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198; Rhone- Poulenc Agrochimie SA and Another v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd and Another (1986) 12 FCR 477; Hornsby Building Information Centre Proprietary Limited and Another v Sydney Building Information Centre Limited [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216. To constitute such breach, a statement must be made by a corporation in the course of trade or commerce. The concept of 'in trade or commerce' has been considered by the majority of the High Court in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Limited v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604. Further the intent of the representor is irrelevant (see Hornsby Building Information Centre 140 CLR 228).</text>

<tocase>Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Limited v Carminco Gold &amp; Resources Limited [2007] FCA 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/499.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Initially the respondents defended Findlay Underwriters' claims and a cross-claim was filed by each of them. However, no evidence was filed in support of the cross-claim. On 2 April 2007 Mr Salfinger made an unsuccessful application to adjourn the proceedings on the ground of his illness. The relevant orders relating to the preparation of the matter for hearing and of the Court's decision concerning the application for adjournment are contained in an interlocutory judgment of the Court delivered on 17 April 2007: see Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Limited v Carminco Gold &amp; Resources Limited [2007] FCA 499.

4 After such judgment was delivered, counsel representing the respondents sought and was granted leave to withdraw. Accordingly the proceedings have been heard undefended.

5 Mr Ivor Findlay is Managing Director of Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers Pty Limited ('Findlay Stockbrokers') and Director of Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Limited ('Findlay Underwriters'). Findlay Stockbrokers conducts a stockbroking business, acting as agent for high net-worth individuals for the buying and selling of shares. Findlay Underwriters conducts a corporate advisory and underwriting business which includes advisory work in respect of capital raising and corporate dealings in matters such as Initial Public Offerings ('IPO'), placement of shares, underwriting, sub-underwriting and other preparatory work necessary for the flotation of a new company.</text>

<text>46 It is sufficient for the offending conduct to have been a cause of an applicant's loss or damage and there is no requirement that such conduct was the only cause of an applicant's loss or damage (see: I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 119).

47 Findlay Underwriters relies upon three representations made by the respondents in support of their claim that Carminco and TPM breached the provisions of s 52 of the Act. Additionally Findlay Underwriters relies upon a breach of s 75B of the Act in respect of the conduct of Mr Salfinger. The Court will make its findings in respect of each of the representations relied upon hereunder.

48 Mr Salfinger made oral statements to Mr Findlay and to Mr Vajda concerning the ownership by Trans Pacific Mining Ltd (Carminco) of an option to purchase Summit Lake Mine. The first representation was made orally in a conversation between Mr Salfinger and Mr Vajda wherein Mr Salfinger said words to the effect 'Trans Pacific also has an option to purchase Summit Lake Mine'. Such representation was repeated in meetings with Mr Vajda and Mr Findlay in November 2003. At the latter meeting documents were produced, issued by Trans Pacific Mining Ltd which refer, inter alia, to the Summit Lake Mine in Canada. The following statement appears in relation to such site:
 
 'TPM has negotiated an option to acquire a 100% interest in the mine for C$550,000.'</text>

<text>45 To recover damages pursuant to s 82 of the Act an applicant must prove that loss or damage suffered was 'by' the conduct claimed to be in breach of the relevant parts of the Act. The meaning of the word 'by' in s 82 was considered by Mason J in Wardley Australia Limited and Another v The State of Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525 where his Honour said:
 
 '...s 82(1) should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation recently discussed by this Court in March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd (1001) 171 CLR 506; 65 ALJR 335; 99 ALR 423; 12 MVR 353; [1991] Aust Torts Reports 81-095; 9 BCL 215, except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act'.</text>
