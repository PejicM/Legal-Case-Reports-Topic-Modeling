<tocase>Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) (2004) 208 ALR 242</tocase>
<text>In Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) (2004) 208 ALR 242, Campbell J concluded at [68] that s 564 operates as an exception to the prima facie equality of treatment of "all unsecured creditors within the respective classes which s 556 recognises". Barrett J in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490 accepted at [8] that as a matter of power the Court may under s 564 make an order that causes a creditor chosen for preferred treatment to rank ahead of "any one or more of the creditors having claims within the s 556(1) categories". That construction was said to follow firstly because s 556(1) is subject to Division 6 and thus subject to the power conferred on the Court by s 564 and secondly, because s 564 provides that a preferred creditor may be given an advantage " over others in consideration of the risk assumed". At [9], Barrett J said this: 
 Section 564 contemplates that assisting or indemnifying creditors within its purview may be given "an advantage over others". The section does not say "all others" or "some others" or "any others". In referring to "others" generally, it contemplates, in my view, that the court may, by its order, give the assisting or indemnifying creditors "an advantage over" any one or more of the other creditors or all of them, with the result that the court may, as a matter of jurisdiction, cause the debts of the creditors in question to be placed on any of the rungs of the ladder of priority created by s 556(1) (and, within a particular rung, above, below or beside the creditors with claims that s 559 causes to rank equally inter se), above the topmost of those rungs or below the bottom rung (yet ahead of "all other unsecured debts and claims"). In short, s 564 is cast in terms giving the court a complete discretion regarding positioning of the whole or any part of the debts of the assisting or indemnifying creditors on the scale of priorities in the winding up and the opening words of s 556(1) cause any such positioning ordered by the court to have effect despite what would otherwise be the order of priority under s 556(1).

Clearly, the exercise of the discretion under s 564 of the Corporations Act in such a way as to prefer an indemnifying creditor to that of the liquidator in payment of his claim for the expenses properly incurred in preserving, realising or getting in property of the company, would be very unusual. In Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) (supra) an order was made for distribution of the settlement sum on the assumption that allowance would be made for the payment of recovery expenses of the liquidator and his advisers. The authorities do not reveal any examples of an advantage being conferred upon an indemnifying creditor in priority to the costs of recovery of the property. In the present circumstances, there are two factors which seem to me to be particularly important in weighing all the factors. First, the settlement sum was not brought about simply by reason of the provision of the indemnity. Plainly, the indemnity was catalytic. However, there is no doubt that the continuing recovery action by the liquidator and the solicitors for the liquidator during the second half of 2007 and 2008 completed the chemistry of that reaction, brought the negotiations to a head and resulted in a settlement agreement. No criticism can properly be levied against the Deputy Commissioner for failing to join in that settlement even though such a step might have been productive of an additional $15,000.00 elevating the settlement sum to $100,000.00. The Deputy Commissioner is charged with the important responsibility of protecting the taxation revenue of the Commonwealth by enforcing the taxation laws and properly exercising administrative discretions conferred upon him or her. The price the Deputy Commissioner was being asked to pay in joining in the settlement was the granting of a release and discharge of the relevant taxpayers. Plainly, that release would have been inappropriate simply as an exercise in facilitating a settlement of the liquidator's claims. The material shows that the proposed release was not based on any assessment by the Deputy Commissioner of the liability of the taxpayers in connection with their performance or otherwise of taxation obligations.

The second factor is the apparent acceptance by the liquidator that the Deputy Commissioner would be entitled, in principle, to payment from the recovered monies of the amount of the indemnity. That "in principle" position may not have been informed by the possibility that the value of the recovered property or monies obtained in settlement would not exceed the costs of recovery steps or proceedings. Perhaps the liquidator assumed or alternatively the parties assumed that the present question brought before the Court would not arise in the way that it has. However, the liquidator's correspondence and the Indemnity Agreement seem to suggest that the indemnifying creditor was to be afforded priority in the recoupment of the indemnity from an amount recovered.

Section 564 of the Corporations Act confers power to make such order as the Court deems just. Although an order conferring an advantage on the Deputy Commissioner to that of the liquidator in payment of recovery costs and expenses is unusual, it seems to me that the contribution of the three principal participants who have suffered a loss as a result of those contributions - in the case of the Deputy Commissioner, the provision of the indemnity in the amount of $30,000.00 and in the case of the liquidator and his advisers, the steps or activities undertaken by them in pursuing recovery action to a settlement conclusion ought, in principle, to be borne rateably.</text>

It is clear from the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006 and cl 9 of the Indemnity Agreement of 6 February 2007 that the indemnity was to be provided by the Deputy Commissioner on the footing that where an amount was recovered or received by the liquidator arising out of the processes sought to be undertaken through the use of the indemnity, the liquidator would apply to the Court for an order that the indemnifying creditor would receive priority for the amount of the indemnity. That position was also an element of the proposal in relation to the further indemnity. Having regard to the expectations reflected in the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006, it seems that the parties proceeded on the basis that property (an amount) recovered by reason of the various processes would significantly exceed the costs of recovery and would thus be productive of a fund of money from which distributions would be made in part reduction of the Deputy Commissioner's debt, after redemption of the indemnity amount. Part reduction of the debts of the trade creditors of $27,071.34 in the aggregate, may have been unlikely. In any event, redemption of the amount of the indemnity was to be a priority. The debt to the Deputy Commissioner was revised on 5 June 2007 to $128,927.61. In the result, the settlement funds fall well short of meeting the costs and expenses of recovery. The authorities ( Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (supra); Household Financial Services Pty Ltd v Chase Medical Centre Pty Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 294; State Bank of New South Wales v Brown (2001) 38 ACSR 715) demonstrate that in exercising the discretion consideration needs to be given to the risk run by the indemnifying creditor in providing the indemnity; the value of the property recovered or the sum recovered; the failure of other creditors to participate in providing an indemnity; the proportions between the debt due to the indemnifying creditor and other debts; the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide indemnities so as to enable a liquidator to pursue remedies which would result in recovery of the property of the company; and all other relevant circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Australian Steel Company v EPS Group [2006] NSWSC 1080; (2007) 59 ACSR 602</tocase>
<text>That view of the scope of the power conferred on the Court by s 564 and the relationship between s 564 and s 556(1) was adopted by Austin J in Australian Steel Company v EPS Group [2006] NSWSC 1080; (2007) 59 ACSR 602 although his Honour thought that the discretion was not correctly described as a "complete discretion" or a "totally open discretion" but rather a power to make such orders as the Court deems just. Nevertheless, the discretion is conferred in broad terms.

As to the question of power, the liquidator contends that he is not a creditor in respect of a claim for the payment of the costs and expenses of recovering property of the company for the purposes of s 556(1) and therefore his claim to those costs and expenses cannot be deferred to that of the indemnifying creditor as an exercise of power to adjust claims within s 556(1). Secondly, the liquidator as a person with a claim for payment of recovery costs and expenses is not a person contemplated by the phrase in s 564 "an advantage over others". The liquidator is not, it is said, an "other" person. Accordingly, there is no power to confer an advantage on the Deputy Commissioner over the liquidator in relation to the liquidator's claim to receive the settlement monies in satisfaction of the costs and expenses incurred in recovering the property of the company.

Section 556(1) , subject to Division 6, attributes priority of payment to particular classes of debts and claims, as compared with all other unsecured debts and claims. The first such debt or claim is expenses properly incurred by the liquidator in preserving, realising or getting in the property of the company. Section 556(1) treats those expenses as a claim of the liquidator upon the estate or property of the company. Such a claim ranks above all other claims primarily because those expenses in the ordinary course represent the price paid to secure the company's assets or realise or get in the property of the company for the benefit of those entitled to participate in the distribution of that property according to the provisions of the Corporations Act . The paramouncy of those expenses conveys a clear statutory intention that the liquidator is entitled to recoup out of the property of the company, the costs and expenses "properly" incurred in taking the relevant steps that meet the statutory description in s 556(1)(a). However, that claim nevertheless remains a claim within s 556(1) and is subject to a power in the Court conferred by s 564 to adjust the order of priority including the paramouncy of such a claim, as appears just in all the circumstances, as between an indemnifying creditor and others. In that sense, the reference to others must be taken to be a reference to any other person (or entity) that has a debt or claim to be paid in the winding up of a company whatever the priority of that debt or claim may be according to the proper operation of the relevant provisions of the Corporations Act .</text>
