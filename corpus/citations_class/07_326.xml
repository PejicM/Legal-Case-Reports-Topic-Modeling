<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/73.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The facts of this case are quite close to the facts of three unanimous decisions of Full Courts of this Court. The members of each court were different so that the decisions represent the views of nine judges of this Court. The decisions are NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ), NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 (Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ). In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied. In NAVX at paragraph [5] the Full Court said this:
 
 "In assessing the adequacy of [the Tribunal's] reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application." 

I note that the appellant in that case was also a Chinese national who claimed refugee status on the basis of his fear of persecution as a Falun Gong practitioner.</text>
