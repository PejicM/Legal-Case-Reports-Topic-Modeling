<tocase>A2 v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 106</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/106.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The issues that fall for determination are:
 &#8226; the applicant's attack on the warrant on the same grounds as those dealt with by Young J in A2 v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 106 (the A2 point);
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the notebook; and
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the DVDs.

14 The A2 point can be disposed of shortly. Mr Lucarelli QC for the applicant said:
 "The parties [are] content ... to ... simply rely upon [their] written submissions and the decision [in] A2 with the statement by the applicant that A2 is wrong. But the applicant understands ... that your Honour may well be persuaded by what [was] said in A2 and that your Honour is naturally entitled to follow A2 ..., although the applicant [says] that A2 is wrong and that your Honour ought not follow it." 
 

I have read A2 and the parties' written submissions.

16 The applicant has put no contention to me that was not put to Young J in A2 or, more importantly, explained why his Honour's treatment thereof was deficient. In those circumstances, I cannot see how I could be convinced that his Honour was clearly or plainly wrong in A2 .</text>

<text>17 In any case, Young J rejected the principal argument put to him as contrary to the decision of the Full Court in Ryder v Morley (1987) 16 FCR 257. Like Young J, I am bound by the decision in Ryder to reject that argument.

<tocase>Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1301.html</AustLII>
<text>19 In Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at [235] and [236], Hely J said:
 "The applicants contend that the onus of proving the warrants were lawfully issued falls upon ASIC. Reliance was placed upon the decision of Heerey J in Challenge Plastics Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Vic) (No 2) (1994) 49 FCR 541. Heerey J said (at 543): 
 
 
 
 'Generally speaking, administrative acts are presumed to be valid and the onus is on the party seeking to challenge them: ... However, here we have a rather special situation of an entry on premises and removal of documents without the consent of the owner of the premises and documents. Without lawful justification, such conduct would constitute a trespass. In substance, this proceeding has been concerned with the legal justification advanced by the respondent for that action. Where the exercise of executive discretion interferes with liberty or property rights, once the person affected has shown a prima facie case the burden of justifying the legality of the decision is on the executive: R v Secretary of State for Home Department; Ex parte Khawaja [1982] UKHL 5 ; [1984] AC 74 at 112 per Lord Scarman.' 
 
 
 
 I agree that once the applicants show an invasion of their property or premises by ASIC, the onus is upon ASIC to adduce evidence, and to persuade the trier of fact that its invasion of what would otherwise be the applicants' rights was undertaken with lawful justification. But ASIC discharges that onus by the production of the search warrants, and by demonstrating that its actions were within the scope of the authority conferred by the warrants. If the applicants wish to challenge the issue of the warrants on administrative law grounds, then the onus is on them to make good that challenge. This result is consistent with the decision of the Full Court in Malubel [Pty Ltd] v Elder [(1998) 88 FCR 242] at 249 where the Court held that the issue of a warrant is an administrative act, and steps taken pursuant to it may be presumed to be valid unless and until the warrant is set aside. The observations of Gummow J in Ousley v The Queen [(1997) [1997] HCA 49 ; 192 CLR 69] at 130-131 are to like effect." 
 

(The emphasis is mine.) This approach was approved by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 at [85] and [86]. (And see X v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 1475 ; (2004) 139 FCR 413 at [22] per Finn J.) Like Branson J, I think it "the correct approach".

20 The Commission has discharged the onus described by Hely J. The warrant was adduced into evidence by Ms McClure's affidavit, and the notice by Mr Andrew's affidavit. Further, it is not the applicant's case that the Commission's actions were outside the scope of the authority conferred by the warrant and the notice. The applicant's case is described at [24] and [46].

21 Section 3F of the Crimes Act relevantly provides:
 "(1) A warrant that is in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a constable assisting: 
 
 
 ... 
 (c) to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises ...." 
 
 
 

The expression "evidential material" is defined in s 3C as "a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form". The expression "a thing relevant to an indictable offence" is defined in s 3 as:
 
 
 "(a) either of the following: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) anything with respect to which an indictable offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; 
 (ii) anything with respect to which a State offence that has a federal aspect, and that is an indictable offence against the law of that State, has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been committed; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or 
 (c) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence." 
 
 

(The emphasis is mine.)

22 Section 3K relevantly provides: 
 
 
 "(1) The executing officer or constable assisting may bring to the warrant premises any equipment reasonably necessary for the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant. 
 (2) A thing found at the premises may be moved to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) both of the following apply: 
 
 
 
 (i) it is significantly more practicable to do so having regard to the timeliness and cost of examining or processing the thing at another place and the availability of expert assistance; 
 (ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the thing contains or constitutes evidential material ...."

<tocase>Chairman, National Crime Authority v Flack (1998) 156 ALR 501</tocase>
<text>47 By his written submissions in reply, the applicant contends that:
 "[The applicant] was required to produce a thing which was not in his 'custody, possession and/or control' in the requisite sense . In circumstances where: 
 
 
 (a) the notice ... required the production of the ... DVDs 'forthwith'; 
 (b) [the applicant] was afforded no opportunity to verify the contents of the DVDs; and 
 (c) [the applicant] was handed the ... DVDs at a time when his presence at the [Commission's] offices was involuntary 
 
 
 possession of the 'thing' did not pass to [the applicant]." 
 

(The emphases are in the original.) The applicant also cites Chairman, National Crime Authority v Flack (1998) 156 ALR 501 as discussing the relevant authorities. (The Commission does not dispute the facts set out in sub-paras (a) to (c) of the passage quoted above.)

48 The applicant's contentions in the passage quoted at [47] are fundamentally unsound. The qualification of "custody, possession and/or control" by "the requisite sense" begs the question of what that sense is. The terms of the notice are clear. There is no reason to read them down. In the events that occurred, possession however fleeting of the DVDs passed to the applicant when they were handed to him. It is beside the point that they were created by the Commission and handed to him in the knowledge or with the intention that he would immediately thereafter be compelled by way of the notice to hand them back. Until he was so compelled he was in possession of them. It is also beside the point that he was not in possession of them when the notice was issued as opposed to when the notice was served on him. As far as he was concerned, the notice was a dead letter unless and until it was served on him.

52 The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing. They include the 'finding' cases of Bridges v Hawkesworth (1851) 21 LJQB 75, South Staffordshire Water Company v Sharman [1896] 2 QB 44 and Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 QB 1004. This is not a 'finding' case. The DVDs were handed to the applicant at the Commission's offices. The question whether the Commission intended to exercise control over its offices to the extent that it owns things found therein by strangers simply does not arise for determination.</text>

<tocase>Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393</tocase>
<text>49 The Commission referred to the decision of Hill J in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 396 and 403. In that case, material had been 'seized' at two premises. However, those 'seizures' were defective. In order to remedy those defects, the material was returned to the respective premises and 're-seized'. At 396, his Honour said:
 "At the premises at Bungo Street the goods which had been seized were brought into the house and then re-seized. However, at 40 Parson Street the seized goods remained in the police vehicle stationary in the driveway and Mr Puglisi's wife was asked to come out to the vehicle and identify the material. The material was 're-seized' while it was still in the vehicle ... and driven away." 
 

At 403, his Honour said:
 
 "In my view the items that were in the Federal Police car were never 'found' at the Parson Street premises in the course of a search. Nor were they ever then 'seized'. The items were always in the possession of the ... Federal Police and in the car. In my view it would be a misuse of language to speak of items always in the possession of the ... Federal Police as being 'found' at premises merely because they are in a car owned by the Federal Police parked in the premises. Nor can items held by the ... Federal Police be seized by the Federal Police from the Federal Police." 
 

Clearly, the situation in the instant proceeding was different from that in Puglisi . The DVDs were handed back to the applicant. That is analogous to the situation at the Bungo Street premises rather than that at the Parson Street premises referred to above.

50 The fact that the applicant was not afforded an opportunity to verify that the DVDs' contents matched their description in the notice does not detract from the fact that he was in possession of the DVDs at time the notice was served on him. Only if the DVDs' contents did not match their description would the notice have been defective because it compelled the applicant to produce "forthwith" a thing that was not in his "custody, possession and/or control".

51 The fact that the applicant was served with the notice during his involuntary attendance at the Commission's offices is neither here nor there.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>55 The Commission did not adduce evidence that the examiner was satisfied in the requisite sense. That lack of evidence is unexceptionable because the applicant failed to adduce evidence that the examiner was not so satisfied and first raised the issue of whether or not the examiner was so satisfied on the day the hearing of the application commenced. For those reasons:
 &#8226; it is not appropriate for me to draw an inference of the sort described by Windeyer J in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 320-321 from the Commission's failure to adduce evidence from Messrs Hellings or Goodchild whose roles in the procurement of the notice are described at [44](d) or the examiner; and
 &#8226; I need not deal with the applicant's contention that the examiner could not have been satisfied in the requisite sense when he issued the notice because he must have known that the Commission created the DVDs and/or that the applicant was not, at that point in time, in "custody, possession and/or control" of the DVDs.</text>

<tocase>Johnson v Williams (2000) 58 ALD 1</tocase>
<text>56 For the above reasons, I would dismiss the application with costs. Further, if I am wrong in any of those reasons, I would, in the exercise of my discretion, refuse to grant the relief sought. In Johnson v Williams (2000) 58 ALD 1 at [24] and [25], the Full Court of this Court said:
 "One matter that is properly to be taken into account in proceedings to quash or have declared invalid an administrative decision is whether there has been delay in bringing the proceeding. Courts quite properly take the view that there is a need for a speedy determination of the validity of an administrative decision. The interests of good administration and third parties are at stake: O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] UKHL 1 ; [1983] 2 AC 237 at 284; Caswell v Dairy Produce Quota Tribunal for England &amp; Wales [1990] UKHL 5 ; [1990] 2 AC 738. Unreasonable or unaccounted for delay cannot be tolerated. 
 
 The timely action that is required is the commencement of proceedings for or in the nature of judicial review." 
 

(The emphasis is mine.) In that case, the relief sought from and refused by the primary judge was an order to quash a decision of the Attorney-General to refuse to withdraw a request for extradition.

57 In the present case, the warrant was issued on 13 February 2004 and executed the following day. The notice was issued and served on 19 February 2004. The application was filed on 21 December 2005: over 22 months after the events that gave rise to it occurred. The applicant has failed to explain his inordinate delay in commencing proceedings. His attempt to do so by the affidavit of Philip Cadman (of his solicitors) fails. Mr Cadman deposed that:
 "The ... warrant ... and the ... notice ... form part of a clandestine investigation conducted in circumstances of confidentiality and secrecy. Prior to the [Commission] releasing details of actions taken in the course of their investigations ... [by way of certain press releases issued in June 2005 and exhibited to Mr Andrew's affidavit], it was not possible for the applicant or any other members of the public to be aware that materials outside the scope of the warrant and the notice ... were being acted on by the [Commission]." 
 

Apart from being hearsay, this is beside the point. The applicant complains that the Commission's exercise of coercive power in the form of a substantial interference with his personal property was unlawful because it was done pursuant to an unlawful warrant and notice. What happened afterwards is irrelevant to the basis upon which that complaint is made. At most, it merely to put it colloquially raised the stakes for the applicant in his attempt to impugn the warrant and the notice.

58 In any case, Mr Cadman's evidence is contradicted by other evidence adduced by the applicant. Michael Carr (of other solicitors for the applicant) deposed that on 19 February 2004 a member of the Commission advised the applicant in the presence of himself and Mr Galbally QC who appeared for the applicant before me that
 "the investigation being conducted by the [Commission] would be broadened to include other persons who the applicant had dealings with, as identified in correspondence contained on the applicant's computer [and] stated words to the ... effect [that] '[t]here will be another search warrant'." 
 

It is neither here nor there that no such warrant was obtained.</text>
