<tocase>Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244</tocase>
<text>220 Accepting that there is no reproduction or substantial reproduction of the Weekly Schedule on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres, authorisation does not arise. If there is such reproduction, the facts support the contention that Ice "authorises" the reproduction of the Weekly Schedule by users of the IceGuide within the meaning of s 36 of the Act. It "sanctions, approves and countenances" such activity ( The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 12-13 per Gibbs J and at 20-21 per Jacobs J). Ice encourages use of the IceGuide and is, at best, indifferent as to whether the Weekly Schedule is reproduced on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres ( Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244). Ice has the power to prevent such reproduction and takes no steps to do so. The actions of Ice are not dissimilar to those of the proprietor of software made available from websites enabling copying and communication of sound recordings ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1).</text>

<tocase>Autospin (Oil Seals) Ltd v Beehive Spinning (a firm) [1995] RPC 683</tocase>
<text>200 The question is one of protection of the relevant skill and labour ( Desktop at [235] per Lindgren J citing Laddie J in Autospin (Oil Seals) Ltd v Beehive Spinning (a firm) [1995] RPC 683 at 697-8). Once sufficient skill and effort have been expended in working out the information and writing it down, the compilation so created is a literary work and protected by copyright. As put by Lindgren J at [238]:
 
 ' [t] he relevant principle is that where copyright protection is attracted to a compilation of factual information by the labour of collecting, verifying, recording and assembling the data and not by reference to the form of the compilation, reproduction does not require formal resemblance, and the notion of a substantial part of the compilation is not defined by reference to its form.' (emphasis added)
 

It follows that where the relevant skill and labour is referable also to the form of the compilation, the notion of a substantial part of the compilation is also defined by reference to its form.

201 It is not disputed that Nine's employees expend skill and labour in the content and arrangement of the Weekly Schedule in the form in which it is sent to the Aggregators.

202 Nine contends that, once Mr Healy has decided on the order of the programs best to suit Nine's commercial and strategic interests, the time and title information in the Weekly Schedule is, in the words of Lindgren J in Desktop at [21], a "whole of universe case" a case where there was no selection of the subscribers to be included in the directory and where the directory permitted only one mode of arrangement of the factual information and only one mode of expression of the individual entries. In such a case, anyone exploring the same universe would discover the same factual information and would, inescapably, produce a directory relevantly identical in form, as well as in content, to Telstra's (at [22] [24]).</text>

<tocase>Avel Pty Ltd v Intercontinental Grain Importers Pty Ltd (1996) 65 FCR 154</tocase>
<text>232 The history of the section suggests that it was concerned to deter unjustified threats themselves, threats that did not result in infringement proceedings or could not be justified by actual infringement; threats made to ' frighten away competitors or to damage such persons less directly, by threatening to sue their customers or suppliers as joint tortfeasors ' (Ricketson S and Creswell C, The Law of Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs &amp; Confidential Information (Lawbook Co., subscription service) at [2.195]; Avel Pty Ltd v Intercontinental Grain Importers Pty Ltd (1996) 65 FCR 154 at 159)). It is a right extended to the threatened person not generally available to those threatened with an action for a civil wrong.

233 Section 202 does not specifically provide for a cross-claim in an infringement action, only for the commencement of an action. However, by O 5 r 1(1) of the Federal Court Rules , a respondent:
 
 'may cross-claim against an applicant for any relief to which the respondent would be entitled against the applicant if the applicant were a respondent in a separate proceeding commenced in the Court by the respondent for that purpose.'

234 Ice did not bring its action when the threats were current. Had it brought the action, Nine would have undoubtedly availed itself of the entitlement in s 202(4) of the Act to bring an action for infringement by way of cross-claim. I do not see that Ice would have been precluded from bringing a cross-claim under s 202(1) just because Nine filed its proceedings first. It is important, however, to make it clear that Ice at no time has the right under s 202 to claim for any remedy that is not based upon the threats. To the extent that those threats were directed to Ice, they ceased upon the commencement of proceedings by Nine. Section 202 does not entitle Ice to claim damages resulting from the commencement of these proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Avel Proprietary Ltd v Multicoin Amusements [1990] HCA 58 ; (1990) 171 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/58.html</AustLII>
<text>230 There are a number of indicia in s 202 that assist in determining the scope of application of the section:
 
 &#8226; The threat is of an action or proceeding. The action or proceeding cannot have commenced before the threat is made. Once the proceedings for infringement are commenced, the threat no longer exists.
 &#8226; The threat must be unjustifiable, that is the acts in respect of which the complaint is made do not constitute an infringement of copyright.
 &#8226; The words ' threatens ' and ' making the threats ' in s 202(1) are in the present tense.
 &#8226; An action for groundless threats may be commenced by a "person aggrieved", that is, standing to bring the action is not restricted to the recipient of the threat. In Avel Proprietary Ltd v Multicoin Amusements [1990] HCA 58 ; (1990) 171 CLR 88 at 118 McHugh J observed that the evident object of the section is to enable a "person aggrieved" by the threat of legal proceedings to obtain a determination as to whether the activities in respect of which an action or proceeding is threatened are an infringement; it prevents the "Sword of Damocles" hanging over the head of the threatened person ( Avel Proprietary Ltd [1990] HCA 58 ; (1990) 171 CLR 88 at 104 per Dawson J).
 &#8226; The remedies provided for are a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable, an injunction against the continuation of the threats and damages. These remedies relate to the threats and not to any action or proceeding for infringement of copyright.
 &#8226; The remedies are not available if the acts do constitute an infringement of copyright.
 &#8226; Not only is it a defence that the acts constituted infringement, a defendant in an action for unjustifiable threats may counterclaim, effectively as an action for infringement (s 202(4)).
 &#8226; There is no provision for an action or a cross-claim for the unjustified or unjustifiable commencement of an action for infringement of copyright.</text>

<tocase>British Broadcasting Company v Wireless League Gazette Publishing Company [1926] 1 Ch 432</tocase>
<text>179 Nine relies on the decisions in which British courts have found infringement of copyright in television or radio guides. In British Broadcasting Company v Wireless League Gazette Publishing Company [1926] 1 Ch 432, the British Broadcasting Company ('BBC') began publishing its own daily programs for the ensuing week each Friday in the Radio Times . The published material gave the day and hour of each performance and certain additional information. The preparation, arrangement and editing of the actual programs involved considerable time, skill and labour, although the preliminary work of fixing the times, engaging the artists and choosing the items had been done some time beforehand. Justice Astbury held that there was copyright in the compilation of the seven advance daily programs from which the defendants selected and deliberately copied items. His Lordship found that the defendants had, by copying the published program listings, infringed copyright in the Radio Times . Justice Astbury observed that there was still infringement where less than the whole of the compilation was taken but did not give this aspect any detailed consideration because there had been "wholesale copying" (at 443).

181 In neither of these two cases was there not only an absence of wholesale copying but also the checking of information against a third party aggregated guide, the checking of a selection of listed items and that selection being of the information for a given entry and the number of entries in the compilation. The cases illustrate that copying is an important factor and that it is a matter of fact and degree to ascertain whether there has been a taking of a substantial part. Each case turns on its own facts. While Independent Television Publications and Wireless League Gazette are examples that have fallen on one side of the line, they are not determinative of these proceedings.</text>

<text>54 Where there is skill and labour not only in the obtaining or collection of the material but also in the form of arrangement, or where there may be more than one arrangement of the obtained material, it does not follow that any form of arrangement will infringe. Cambridge University Press v University Tutorial Press (1928) 45 RPC 335 is illustrative of this principle. In Cambridge , there was no infringement of a collection of 13 essays where the collection was included in a later work with an additional seven essays, in different order and with different notes and introductions.</text>

<tocase>Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] FCAFC 112 ; (2002) 119 FCR 491</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/112.html</AustLII>
<text>5 Nine asserts that copyright subsists in the Nine Schedules as compilation literary works within the meaning of s 10(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ('the Act'). It submits that any doubt as to whether copyright so subsists was extinguished by the Full Court decision in Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] FCAFC 112 ; (2002) 119 FCR 491. The infringement allegations are founded on the assertion that Ice appropriates the ' skill and labour of authorship ' of Nine in compiling the Nine Schedules by reproducing program time, title and date of broadcast information from the publicly available Aggregated Guides.

6 Nine alleges that the IceGuide includes a close to 100% reproduction of the time and title information in the Nine Schedules, as updated by any late changes and that the activities of Ice in producing and disseminating the IceGuide involve five acts of infringement of the copyright in the Nine Schedules. The second respondent ('Ice Holdings') is said to be jointly liable for those acts of infringement.

7 The allegations are denied by Ice. Ice does not dispute that copyright subsists in the Weekly Schedule. Ice asserts that it did not (and does not) copy the Weekly Schedule in creating and updating the IceGuide. It denies taking all or a substantial part of the Weekly Schedule. It denies that Nine owns independent copyright in components of the Weekly Schedule and submits that other Nine Schedules are not relevant to the proceedings. Ice also seeks leave to file a cross-claim alleging that Nine has made unjustified threats of copyright infringement ('the second cross-claim'). An earlier cross-claim was discontinued.</text>

<tocase>Donoghue v Allied Newspapers, Limited [1938] Ch 106</tocase>
<text>183 The originality of a compilation may lie in the selection or arrangement of the information. It also may reflect the skill and labour of gathering the facts. As already noted, in the present case, the Weekly Schedule reflects both. It is only the originality of expression that is relevant, not the originality of the idea the subject of the expression ( Donoghue v Allied Newspapers Limited [1938] Ch 106 at 110 per Farwell J). It must be determined whether the part that is taken is an essential or material feature of the whole work, regarded as a copyright work; that is, ' whether the part or parts taken represent a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work "original" ' ( Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [55] per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ). As one should not dissect a work to determine if a part could be protected by copyright standing alone ( Ladbroke at 277 per Lord Reid), so it is inappropriate to dissect the work for the purposes of infringement. The correct approach is to decide whether the work as a whole is protected by copyright and then to determine whether the work or a substantial part of the work as a whole has been taken.</text>

<text>182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a "substantial part", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842). A defendant may rework the work of a plaintiff, capturing the ideas used or facts referred to but in a way that does not infringe because it is not a substantial reproduction. It may constitute a new original work. The taking of a substantial part of a copyright work will vary depending on the nature of the work and the degree of originality of the original work ( Skybase at 532 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). The ' originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' is critical ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J).</text>

<tocase>Feist Publications Inc v Rural Telephone Service Co Inc (1991) 499 US 340</tocase>
<text>55 Nine relies on what it describes as the high level of protection in Australia afforded to ' industrious collection [s] of facts ' or ' "sweat of the brow" compilations organised in an orthodox or natural manner (cf the position in the United States of America as outlined in Feist Publications Inc v Rural Telephone Service Co Inc (1991) 499 US 340). Nine submits that the preparatory skill of the thinking and the planning and the skill of setting down the program time and title in material form as a compilation are not to be separated. That may be the case where, as in Desktop , the skill and labour was in the collection of the data and the form of the compilation followed from that collection and the nature of the work. It does not follow where the skill and labour of collection of information was preparatory to the further exercise of skill and labour of creation of the arrangement of that information in the Weekly Schedule. Nine's submission also ignores the correct characterisation of the skill and labour employed in the creation of the Weekly Schedule, as the arranging in a single document of not only the order of the programs and their time and title which followed from the creation of the Nine Programming, but also the additional program information and the synopses and the arrangement of the different sets of data.

56 Accordingly: 
 
 (a) Where sufficient skill and labour is expended in gathering the material for inclusion in the compilation, but not in the form of presentation or arrangement of the material because the form is dictated by the nature of the material, that skill and labour is protected. This was the relevant skill and labour protected in Desktop .
 (b) Where the form of presentation or arrangement of a compilation is a product of the skill and labour of the author, it is that form that is protected.
 (c) Copyright subsists in the Weekly Schedule as an original work by reason of both "types" of skill and labour.

57 As I have said, the Weekly Schedule is not issued to the public. It is relevantly sent to HWW, eBroadcast and Pagemasters, the Aggregators who aggregate the information therein with comparable information obtained from other television broadcasters, from 17 (Pagemasters) to 14 (eBroadcast and HWW) days before the start of the broadcast week. The Aggregated Guides are published in: 
 
 &#8226; print (eg, magazine TV Week and newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald ); 
 &#8226; online (eg, &lt;yourtv.com.au&gt; ('the YourTV Guide'));
 &#8226; mobile phone content services (eg, the Vodaphone Mobile Phone Guide ); 
 &#8226; the Channel 4 Digital Guide ; and

<tocase>Gold Peg International Pty Ltd v Kovan Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 57</tocase>
<text>116 Copyright in a literary work is infringed where a person, not being the owner of the copyright and without licence, does or authorises the doing in Australia of any act comprised in the copyright (s 36(1) of the Act). The owner of the copyright in a literary work has the exclusive right to do the acts set out in s 31(1)(a) of the Act. These acts relevantly include ' to reproduce the work in a material form ' (s 31(1)(a)(i)) and ' to communicate the work to the public ' (s 31(1)(a)(iv)). An ' infringing copy ' is defined in s 10(1) to mean, relevantly, a reproduction of the work, or of an adaptation of the work '. Infringement by reproduction is usually said to require first, a "sufficient degree" of similarity between the two works and, secondly, that there is a "causal connection" between the two works ( Gold Peg International Pty Ltd v Kovan Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 57 at [173]-[174] per Crennan J; Skybase Nominees Pty Ltd v Fortuity Pty Ltd (1996) 36 IPR 529 at 531 per Hill J; Desktop at [220] per Lindgren J). A reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the work is an infringement (s 14(1)(b)) of the Act).

182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a "substantial part", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842). A defendant may rework the work of a plaintiff, capturing the ideas used or facts referred to but in a way that does not infringe because it is not a substantial reproduction. It may constitute a new original work. The taking of a substantial part of a copyright work will vary depending on the nature of the work and the degree of originality of the original work ( Skybase at 532 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). The ' originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' is critical ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J).

185 In Gold Peg , Crennan J discussed the assessment of infringement. The first inquiry was to look to the similarities between two works, " which is a question of degree, taking into account the originality and essential nature of the elements which are found " (at [174]). The second inquiry was whether there had been actual copying. Her Honour considered it "instructive" whether the products would compete in the market. If actual copying were found, the next step was to ask whether a "substantial part" was copied (at [179]). The taking of a substantial part may occur in circumstances where quite small portions of a work are taken (at [188]); it is a question of quality rather than quantity. The quality of what is taken reflects the importance which the part taken bears in relation to the copyright work as a whole. It is not relevant to have regard to the importance that the part taken forms of the defendant's work (at [189]). Justice Crennan considered the factors relevant to determining substantial part to include originality, whether the purpose of the taking was to save labour and the effect of the taking in the market for the plaintiff's work (at [191] [192]).

186 The Weekly Schedule and the IceGuide are each similar in the time and title content for Nine programs but are not similar in the totality of the information included nor in the form of presentation of the data. Ice did not copy the whole of the information for insertion into the IceGuide but there has been the taking of time and title information from the Aggregated Guides by checking and updating of the IceGuide. Ice staff access those guides and choose whether to replace the time and/or title information in the starting template for each day with information from the Aggregated Guides.</text>

<text>237 While the second cross-claim would not prolong the existing application by Nine, permitting Ice to file the second cross-claim would prolong the proceedings between the parties. The injustice to Nine if the second cross-claim were filed would, it seems to me, to be out of proportion to the injustice to Ice if leave is refused ( Incentive Dynamics Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) v Robins [1998] FCA 1046 per Mansfield J). Ice contends that, if leave is refused, it could commence separate proceedings under s 202. That is, of course, a matter for Ice. Such a right lessens the injustice that Ice might otherwise suffer if it were totally precluded from exercising its rights under the section.

238 In the circumstances and in the exercise of my discretion, I decline to grant leave to Ice to file the second cross-claim.

239 For the reasons I have given, the application should be dismissed. For convenience only, a summary of my findings follows.</text>

<tocase>Independent Television Publications Limited v Time Out Limited [1984] FSR 64</tocase>
<text>180 In Independent Television Publications Limited v Time Out Limited [1984] FSR 64, daily program schedules of programs to be broadcast by channels including the BBC were compiled for publication in weekly format in the TV Times and the Radio Times . It was accepted that ' a great deal of time, energy and skill ' was expended in producing the schedules for the programs ultimately listed in the two publications (at 66). The defendants took the date, title and time of transmission information ' either wholly from ' the published weekly schedules or ' possibly occasionally only checked ' the information they published by reference to those guides (at 67, 73). They published all or some of the information taken from the published schedules in Time Out , together with synopses which were independently drafted. The defendants accepted that sufficient skill and labour was invested in the production of the daily program schedules to justify a claim to copyright but argued that that ' what is being done...is no more than creating information '. Mere information, it was submitted, could not be the subject of copyright protection. The issue for determination was whether the schedules did any more than create information. Mr Justice Whitford rejected the submission that the program schedules were mere information that could not be protected by copyright (at 72). His Lordship also considered that a substantial part of the daily program schedules had been taken but recognised that what constituted a substantial part was a question of degree, depending on quantity taken and the importance of what was taken (at 73). It was accepted that selection on "a very limited basis" would not amount to infringement (at 74). The fact that synopses were added did not negate a finding of infringement. His Lordship emphasised that a person is free to start with a public source and from that source to produce his or her own work which may correspond very closely with the copyright work of the earlier author (at 69).

181 In neither of these two cases was there not only an absence of wholesale copying but also the checking of information against a third party aggregated guide, the checking of a selection of listed items and that selection being of the information for a given entry and the number of entries in the compilation. The cases illustrate that copying is an important factor and that it is a matter of fact and degree to ascertain whether there has been a taking of a substantial part. Each case turns on its own facts.

<tocase>Kelly v Morris (1866) LR 1 Eq 697</tocase>
<text>122 In Desktop , Lindgren J examined in detail a number of cases and secondary materials from which the following principles or observations are presently relevant:
 
 &#8226; A work is original if the work was not copied, but originated from the putative author (at [47]).
 &#8226; A person is not prevented from undertaking the original labour of recording a subject "open to all the world", for example a map of a geographical area ( Longman v Winchester (1809) 16 Ves Jun 269 at 272; 33 ER 987 at 988 cited in Desktop at [29]).
 &#8226; The mere publication of information that was open to all the world to publish is not an infringement of another's right ( Leslie v J Young &amp; Sons [1894] AC 335 at 340-1, cited in Desktop at [54]).
 &#8226; ' The owner of copyright has, in short, no monopoly in the subject-matter. Others are at liberty to produce the same result, provided they do so independently and, though they are not the first in the field, their work is none the less "original" in the sense in which that word is used in the Copyright Act 1911 ' ( Halsbury's Laws of England (2 nd ed, 1932, vol 7) at 521, cited in Desktop at [107]). 
 &#8226; The fact that some facts would or might be described by independent authors in the same or similar words may necessarily follow from the subject matter and is not restrained by copyright ( Spiers v Brown (1858) 6 WR 352, cited in Desktop at [31] [32]).
 &#8226; Copying is not an "all or nothing" test. The degree of copying can be taken into account, that is, the degree to which the copyright work was not copied but originated with the putative author and the amount of that author's contribution to bringing a new work into being ( Desktop at [96]).
 &#8226; If a person is to carry out original labour, no part of another compilation can be taken ( Kelly v Morris (1866) LR 1 Eq 697, cited in Desktop at [35]). There is no right to make the results of another's skill and labour the foundation of a subsequent compilation or any material part of it ( Morris v Ashbee (1868) LR 7 Eq 34, cited in Desktop at [39]).

178 Infringement is not necessarily avoided where material is simply checked with the data subject for verification or where the arrangement is different ( Waterlow Publishers Ltd v Rose (1989) 17 IPR 493 cited in Desktop at [346] per Sackville J). However, the concept that the taking of a single line of a directory for the purpose of saving labour and trouble amounts to an infringement was a ' famous but excessive admonition ' ( Desktop at [405] per Sackville J referring to Kelly at 701 2 per Sir W Page Wood VC). The fact that copyright may exist in a compilation does not mean that it exists in the individual facts referred to therein ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ and at 511 per Dixon J). The taking of line of a directory will not be sufficient for infringement if it does not constitute a substantial part (s 14(1) of the Act; Waterlow Directories Ltd v Reed Information Services Ltd (1990) 20 IPR 69 per Aldous J at 73, cited in Desktop at [347] per Sackville J). However, copyright in a compilation may be infringed by appropriating ' an undue amount of the material, although the language employed be different or the order of the material be altered ' (Laddie H, Prescott P, Vitoria M, Speck A and Lane L, The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs (3 rd ed, 2000) at paras 3.88 and 3.90, cited in Desktop at [375] per Sackville J).</text>

<tocase>Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273</tocase>
<text>37 In determining the subsistence of copyright, it is necessary to consider works such as anthologies and compilations as a whole ( Desktop at [99], [152] and [160] per Lindgren J; Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273). In Ladbroke , for example, an argument that copyright attached to individual components of the compilation was rejected by the House of Lords (276-7 per Lord Reid, 284 per Lord Evershed, 285 per Lord Hodson and 291 per Lord Pearce). The relevant compilation was a fixed odds football betting coupon, issued weekly. Their Lordships said that the whole coupon, there considered in the context of a consideration of the originality of the compilation, was to be treated as a single compilation.

45 As noted, s 32 of the Act provides for the subsistence of copyright in original literary works. The test of originality is whether the work was not copied, but originated from the putative author ( Desktop at [160] per Lindgren J). Copyright in a factual compilation is infringed where a person reproduces the copyright work or a substantial part of that work. In this context, '[s] ubstantiality is...determined by reference to the originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J). It follows that, while the subsistence of copyright in the Weekly Schedule is accepted, an understanding of the nature and extent of Nine's skill and labour of authorship of the Weekly Schedule is fundamental to the question of infringement.

46 The extent of an author's contribution to the making of a factual compilation is a question of fact and degree ( Desktop at [160]). In this case, there are two sets of skill and labour exercised by Nine and its employees in the creation of the Weekly Schedule. First, the skill and labour of selecting and arranging the programs to be shown on Nine to attract viewers to programs in the different timeslots and to meet competitors' programs. For the purposes of these proceedings, this is the "antecedent" or "preparatory" skill and labour in the sense discussed in Ladbroke at 287 8 per Lord Hodson and Desktop at [132] and [160] per Lindgren J, [371] and [409] per Sackville J. Secondly, there is the skill and labour of drafting the synopses, selecting and arranging the additional program information such as classifications and consumer advice and recording, weekly, all of the information into documentary form, the Weekly Schedule.

47 Ice accepts that copyright subsists in the Weekly Schedule by virtue of the skill and labour in the scope of selection of programs, the decision to move or replace existing programs, the adjustment of times, program changes, the mode of expression and in the arrangement of the information by Nine. The work of Mr Healy and Ms Wieland and their colleagues at Nine in preparing each Weekly Schedule is not in dispute. Each Weekly Schedule "emanates" from them ( Desktop per Sackville J at [396]).

48 Relatively little information about the preparation and inclusion of synopses by Nine was included in Nine's evidence. Nine devotes skill and labour to producing and preparing synopses for inclusion in the Weekly Schedule. It emerged in cross-examination that Mr Holman, Mr Forrest and occasionally Mr Healy draft synopses for inclusion in the Weekly Schedule. Synopses are also obtained from the producers or publicists for some programs. The synopses are entered into the Nine Database and change each week. They are reviewed by Mr Holman and Ms Wieland before publication of the Weekly Schedule. Ms Wieland may instruct Mr Holman to make amendments to correct typographical or grammatical errors, or to change the description of a program or episode.

51 In Desktop , copyright attached to the compilation by reason of the labour of collecting, verifying, recording and assembling the data and not by reference to the form of the compilation, the alphabetical manner of presentation of the data. The former but not the latter was what originated from the putative author (see, eg Desktop at [438] per Sackville J). In that case, a telephone directory of subscribers in alphabetical order did not permit selection in ordering or expression of the information. Nine submits that, similarly, it is the collocation of information in the Weekly Schedule that is protected. It is the selection of things to be shown in chronological order, as opposed to the order itself, that constitutes the relevant skill and labour to be protected. There must be copying and sufficient resemblance but in such a case, form is not important ( Desktop at [223] per Lindgren J). Nine relies on the fact that copyright protection is medium and technology neutral and that is provided for in the Act (eg, s 21(1A) and s 24). Nine submits that the mere input of material into a database cannot deprive the author of copyright protection.

52 The skill and labour involved in making a factual compilation is likely to vary in each case. As described by Ice, pieces of information are brought together; the selection of that information to the exclusion of other items and the association of pieces of information, one with the other in a line or table creates an intelligible relationship between the pieces of information. The usefulness of the pattern created by the compiler is achieved by the choices that were made and judgment exercised about the individual pieces of information and the relationship between them. There is sufficient skill, judgment and labour in the selection of information and in the mode of expression of the Weekly Schedule, in the presentation of the data after the preparatory work of program selection and arranging is done, to attract copyright protection in that arrangement and presentation. As will become apparent, there is scope for variance in the content of synopses, the selection of additional program information and the overall manner of presentation of the compilation as a whole. The detail of the underlying subject matter, the work in choosing the program for each timeslot is not relevant to the compilation once the "timetable" is prepared, much in the same way that the history of the rolling stock of a rail carrier is not relevant to a train timetable.

53 Infringement of a factual compilation is tested by reference to the interest which the copyright is intended to protect ( Desktop at [223] per Lindgren J). In Desktop , that interest was the labour and expense of gathering together in one place the details of all the members of the given universe of all telephone subscribers in a region the skill and labour in collecting, extracting and verifying the data compiled. Although the constituent parts of the resulting compilation of those names in alphabetical order are inevitably arranged in the same way, the compilation was thereby protected.

183 The originality of a compilation may lie in the selection or arrangement of the information. It also may reflect the skill and labour of gathering the facts. As already noted, in the present case, the Weekly Schedule reflects both. It is only the originality of expression that is relevant, not the originality of the idea the subject of the expression ( Donoghue v Allied Newspapers Limited [1938] Ch 106 at 110 per Farwell J). It must be determined whether the part that is taken is an essential or material feature of the whole work, regarded as a copyright work; that is, ' whether the part or parts taken represent a substantial part of the labour, skill and judgment of the author that made the whole work "original" ' ( Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [55] per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ). As one should not dissect a work to determine if a part could be protected by copyright standing alone ( Ladbroke at 277 per Lord Reid), so it is inappropriate to dissect the work for the purposes of infringement. The correct approach is to decide whether the work as a whole is protected by copyright and then to determine whether the work or a substantial part of the work as a whole has been taken.</text>

<tocase>Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 218 CLR 273</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/14.html</AustLII>
<text>38 In Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 218 CLR 273 at [75] , McHugh A-CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ considered that ' a television broadcast ' for the purposes of s 87 of the Act included the programs ' put out to the public, the object of the activity of broadcasting, as discrete periods of broadcasting identified and promoted by a title '. Their Honours rejected the notion that any image or sound broadcast by way of television in the course of those programs satisfied the statutory description. This suggests that the manner in which an author presents a copyright work may assist in determining what that work is.

39 Section 10(1) of the Act relevantly defines a literary work to include ' a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols '. The work that Nine relevantly produces is the Weekly Schedule. It is that work that is disseminated to the Aggregators. The compilation is expressed in words, figures and symbols that describe, in their totality, time and title information, additional program information and the synopses for a complete broadcast week.

40 The first two columns of the Weekly Schedule, the time and title information, although part of the whole compilation, are not purveyed by Nine and have not been shown to have any commercial value to Nine or the Aggregators. The evidence establishes that the synopses, which can be said to contain the "literary component" of the Weekly Schedule, require time and attention, are important and of commercial and promotional significance. Mr Healy states that he sees them as being a form of promotion for new programs. Nine considers it important that the synopses included within the Weekly Schedule are correct.

184 The underlying principle is that the law of copyright does not give an exclusive right to state or describe particular facts ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ). Substantial reproduction and causal connection are separate and cumulative requirements for a finding of infringement ( Desktop at [399] per Sackville J). If a causal connection is shown, it is then necessary to assess whether the allegedly infringing work can fairly be said to be so sufficiently similar to the first that it is but a reproduction ( Skybase at 533 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). While copying is an essential element in providing the requisite causal connection between the copyright work and the alleged infringement, copying does not, of itself, determine whether or not there has been the taking of a substantial part. Not every act of copying is an infringement of copyright. It is also necessary to establish the appropriate subject matter for copyright, what is original and whether there has been a taking of a substantial part ( Network Ten [2004] HCA 14 ; 218 CLR 273 at [14] [17] per McHugh A-CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ).

197 Nine relies upon the fact that Ice competes with it directly, in the sense that Nine sub-licenses its program listings information through HWW to Foxtel for use in an EPG, the Foxtel Digital Guide. Ice does provide its subscribers with the ability to record Nine programs in digital format, other than by subscription to Foxtel. However, it is not part of Nine's pleaded case that copyright subsists in its television broadcasts or the programs themselves. Nine's copyright in the Weekly Schedule does not extend to protect the interests in the broadcast and recording of those programs that are listed in the compilation (Ricketson S, The Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works: 1886-1986 (1986) at 299, cited in Desktop at [74] per Lindgren J). Those interests are not protected by the compilation but by the copyright which subsists, if established, in Nine's television broadcasts and the programs themselves as copyright works. For example, ' there may be copyrights under Pt IV [of the Act] in a cinematograph film which is the subject of a television broadcast, and the film may utilise the copyrights under Pt III [of the Act] in, for example, original dramatic and musical works ' ( Network Ten [2004] HCA 14 ; 218 CLR 273 at [31] per McHugh A-CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ).

198 Ice does not take the skill and labour of placing programs in that it plays no part in the placement of programs. It is not in competition with Nine to attract viewers in the sense of competition with other television networks. It does not have access to information from the Weekly Schedule until that information is released to the Aggregators and published by them in the Aggregated Guides. It does not take from Nine the timing of the release of the information, as Nine chooses when to provide the Late Changes Notices to the Aggregators for inclusion in the published Aggregated Guides. Ice's business plan requires it to be accurate. Mr Rilett may reject specific time and title information in the published guides and substitute his own listing of a program, although there is no evidence to suggest that this is other than an infrequent occurrence.

199 In determining whether a defendant has taken a substantial part in quality of a work, the impact of the copying on the interest protected by the copyright is relevant (Lahore J and Rothnie W, Copyright and Designs at [34.130]). This, in turn, may make take account of the commercial interests of the copyright owner and whether the parties are in competition, as well as whether there has been a taking of skill and labour. However, the reference point is the original work for which protection is claimed. A compilation is the collection, assembly and arrangement of chosen information into a single entity. Cases addressing the taking of a part of an artistic work, for example a line in a poem or a refrain in a musical work, may address substantial part and the quality and quantity taken differently.</text>

<text>182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a "substantial part", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842). A defendant may rework the work of a plaintiff, capturing the ideas used or facts referred to but in a way that does not infringe because it is not a substantial reproduction. It may constitute a new original work. The taking of a substantial part of a copyright work will vary depending on the nature of the work and the degree of originality of the original work ( Skybase at 532 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). The ' originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' is critical ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J).</text>

<text>228 The Act provides a statutory cause of action for groundless threats of infringement, even if made bona fide ( Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2005] FCA 735 ; (2005) 146 FCR 144 at [48] per Lindgren J). Section 202 relevantly provides:
 
 
 '(1) Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding in respect of an infringement of copyright, then, whether the person making the threats is or is not the owner of the copyright or an exclusive licensee, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned person and may obtain a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable, and an injunction against the continuance of the threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he or she has sustained, unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the action or proceeding was threatened constituted, or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of copyright. 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (4) The defendant in an action under this section may apply, by way of counterclaim, for relief to which he or she would be entitled in a separate action in respect of an infringement by the plaintiff of the copyright to which the threats relate and, in any such case, the provisions of this Act with respect to an action for infringement of a copyright are, mutatis mutandis , applicable in relation to the action. '

229 Nine contends that Ice cannot, as a matter of procedure and of statutory construction, commence proceedings by way of originating process or cross-claim once proceedings for infringement have commenced. Nine submits that the commencement by it of the action for infringement "extinguishes" the existence of the threat of an action or proceedings in respect of an infringement of copyright.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/41.html</AustLII>
<text>222 The requirement under the Act that the "communication" must be "to the public" means "to the copyright owner's public" ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australasian Performing Right Association Limited [1997] HCA 41 ; (1997) 191 CLR 140). Ice submits that Ice's subscribers cannot be considered to be Nine's "public" because ' Nine could not reasonably expect payment from anyone...for receipt by [Ice] subscribers of the [Weekly Schedule]'. It points to Mr Marshall's evidence that there is no paying market for a program guide in non-aggregated format. This does not address Nine's contention. Nine's public includes persons who wish to view Nine's programs. This would include Ice subscribers. Indeed, if it did not, there would be no commercial reason for Ice to include Nine program listings information in the IceGuide.

223 Ice also points to s 22(6) of the Act which relevantly provides that a "communication" is taken to have been made by the person responsible for determining the content of the communication. That person is said to be the subscriber rather than Ice. Ice relies on the fact that users determine the regularity by which data are downloaded and the subsets of IceGuide data that are downloaded (eg, Sydney rather than Melbourne channels). It follows, Ice submits, that there has been no relevant "communication" by Ice.</text>

<text>220 Accepting that there is no reproduction or substantial reproduction of the Weekly Schedule on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres, authorisation does not arise. If there is such reproduction, the facts support the contention that Ice "authorises" the reproduction of the Weekly Schedule by users of the IceGuide within the meaning of s 36 of the Act. It "sanctions, approves and countenances" such activity ( The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 12-13 per Gibbs J and at 20-21 per Jacobs J). Ice encourages use of the IceGuide and is, at best, indifferent as to whether the Weekly Schedule is reproduced on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres ( Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244). Ice has the power to prevent such reproduction and takes no steps to do so.

<tocase>Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/972.html</AustLII>
<text>224 The IceGuide is made available online in such a way that it can be electronically transmitted as a result of a request by the user of the IceGuide. The fact that a user may elect to download the IceGuide for only some channels and determine the regularity of "fetch" is not to the point. The content of such data as is downloaded is plainly "determined", "formulated" or "created" by Ice ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1 at [74] per Tamberlin J). That satisfies s 22(6) of the Act.

225 It follows that, had the first infringement been made out, I would have been of the view that Ice communicates the Weekly Schedule to the public within the meaning of s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act.

226 At the hearing, Ice sought leave to file the second cross-claim seeking a declaration, injunction and damages for unjustified threats pursuant to s 202 of the Act. Leave is required because Ice did not comply with O 5 r 9(1) of the Federal Court Rules (O 5 r 9(2)). Nine opposes leave being granted on the basis that the right to bring the cross-claim does not arise under s 202 and that the discretion should be exercised to refuse leave where Ice sought to file the cross-claim on the second day of hearing. Nine reserves its right to object to the cross-claim as drafted.</text>

<text>220 Accepting that there is no reproduction or substantial reproduction of the Weekly Schedule on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres, authorisation does not arise. If there is such reproduction, the facts support the contention that Ice "authorises" the reproduction of the Weekly Schedule by users of the IceGuide within the meaning of s 36 of the Act. It "sanctions, approves and countenances" such activity ( The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 12-13 per Gibbs J and at 20-21 per Jacobs J). Ice encourages use of the IceGuide and is, at best, indifferent as to whether the Weekly Schedule is reproduced on the hard drives of subscribers' PCs or Media Centres ( Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 210 ALR 244). Ice has the power to prevent such reproduction and takes no steps to do so. The actions of Ice are not dissimilar to those of the proprietor of software made available from websites enabling copying and communication of sound recordings ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1).</text>

<tocase>Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/45.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Nine submits that, were it to create and publish a daily schedule consisting only of time and title information, that would be a copyright protected compilation under the Act. However, that is not what the Weekly Schedule is. The Act provides for the subsistence of copyright in compilations of information, not mere information per se. The fact that copyright may subsist in the Weekly Schedule as a whole does not mean that it attaches to the individual facts referred to or the component parts therein ( Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479 per Latham CJ at 498 and Dixon J at 511).

42 Nine accepts that a proper identification of the copyright work takes account of the way in which the copyright owner packages or presents its work. Nine submits, however, that the identification must take account of the way in which Nine knows the work is going to be delivered to the consumer. Nine relies upon the fact that the published Aggregated Guides, in print and electronically, discard or hide synopses to varying degrees, while the time and title information always appears. It submits that its intention is that the Weekly Schedule ' be published [by the Aggregators] with primary emphasis on the time and title information, and on a daily basis, especially in the digital environment '. However, the fact that a reader may make use of a part of the compilation does not of itself change the nature of the copyright which subsists in the Weekly Schedule an original literary work. That compilation, as supplied to the Aggregators, is not limited to time and title. Nor is it limited to just one day of the relevant broadcast week.

43 Each of the sets of information contained in the Weekly Schedule, including the days in the broadcast week, the additional program information and the synopses, are a part of that compilation. The purpose of the Weekly Schedule is to impart the totality of that information to the Aggregators and, in turn, the public. Nine's operational activities are, as Ms Wieland agreed, ' geared to [a] week to week basis '. The Weekly Schedule, built up each week by Mr Healy and Ms Wieland, inevitably includes the synopses and the additional program information. These, in turn, are an integral part of the relationship between the information in and the design of the Weekly Schedule. The Weekly Schedule is the only relevant work to leave Nine. It is the work sent to the Aggregators. It is, with all of the information it includes, the way in which Nine, for good commercial reasons, presents the collocation of information. The totality of the information there included is necessary because it is required by the Aggregators and is also provided to the Aggregators by Nine's competitors for the purposes of the Aggregated Guides that are made available to the public.

178 Infringement is not necessarily avoided where material is simply checked with the data subject for verification or where the arrangement is different ( Waterlow Publishers Ltd v Rose (1989) 17 IPR 493 cited in Desktop at [346] per Sackville J). However, the concept that the taking of a single line of a directory for the purpose of saving labour and trouble amounts to an infringement was a ' famous but excessive admonition ' ( Desktop at [405] per Sackville J referring to Kelly at 701 2 per Sir W Page Wood VC). The fact that copyright may exist in a compilation does not mean that it exists in the individual facts referred to therein ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ and at 511 per Dixon J). The taking of line of a directory will not be sufficient for infringement if it does not constitute a substantial part (s 14(1) of the Act; Waterlow Directories Ltd v Reed Information Services Ltd (1990) 20 IPR 69 per Aldous J at 73, cited in Desktop at [347] per Sackville J). However, copyright in a compilation may be infringed by appropriating ' an undue amount of the material, although the language employed be different or the order of the material be altered ' (Laddie H, Prescott P, Vitoria M, Speck A and Lane L, The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs (3 rd ed, 2000) at paras 3.88 and 3.90, cited in Desktop at [375] per Sackville J).

182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a "substantial part", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842). A defendant may rework the work of a plaintiff, capturing the ideas used or facts referred to but in a way that does not infringe because it is not a substantial reproduction. It may constitute a new original work. The taking of a substantial part of a copyright work will vary depending on the nature of the work and the degree of originality of the original work ( Skybase at 532 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). The ' originality of that part of the work taken by the alleged infringer ' is critical ( Desktop at [409] per Sackville J).

184 The underlying principle is that the law of copyright does not give an exclusive right to state or describe particular facts ( Victoria Park at 498 per Latham CJ). Substantial reproduction and causal connection are separate and cumulative requirements for a finding of infringement ( Desktop at [399] per Sackville J). If a causal connection is shown, it is then necessary to assess whether the allegedly infringing work can fairly be said to be so sufficiently similar to the first that it is but a reproduction ( Skybase at 533 per Hill J, with whom French J agreed). While copying is an essential element in providing the requisite causal connection between the copyright work and the alleged infringement, copying does not, of itself, determine whether or not there has been the taking of a substantial part. Not every act of copying is an infringement of copyright. It is also necessary to establish the appropriate subject matter for copyright, what is original and whether there has been a taking of a substantial part ( Network Ten [2004] HCA 14 ; 218 CLR 273 at [14] [17] per McHugh A-CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ).

187 If each "sliver" or element of the Nine compilation is entitled to copyright protection, Ice accepts that it cannot defend these proceedings. Ice submits that a piece of information about, for example, a change in episode sequence is not a copyright protected work but ' at best, a tiny star in the galaxy of a compilation '. This accords with Victoria Park . Nine accepts that a single "sliver" of information, such as the programming over five days at 8 pm, does not amount to a substantial part of the Weekly Schedule nor of the Aggregated Guides.

188 The Aggregated Guides publish a substantial part of the information set out in the Weekly Schedule. Nine retains copyright in the Weekly Schedule. The skill and labour invested in a compilation may continue to be protected even where that compilation is integrated into or extended to become a different compilation which is itself protected by copyright. Nine asserts that the Aggregators' publication is as a ' sub-publisher ' of the Weekly Schedule, authorised by Nine. Nine contends that, in updating its guide by reference to the Aggregated Guides, Ice is taking a substantial part of its copyright work.

189 The IceGuide does not replicate the content or form of the Aggregated Guides. The differences in content are primarily in the additional program information and the synopses. Those sets of information from the Weekly Schedule are not necessarily replicated in the Aggregated Guides. For example, synopses are edited and may be shortened. Importantly, the Aggregated Guides also contain information from the Late Change Notices. That information is not included in the Weekly Schedule sent to the Aggregators. The form and arrangement of the IceGuide is different to that of the Aggregated Guides and different, in turn, to the form and arrangement of the Weekly Schedule. Accordingly, neither the content nor the format of the Weekly Schedule is replicated in the IceGuide.</text>

<tocase>Walter v Lane [1900] AC 539</tocase>
<text>209 The compiler of the Weekly Schedule of Nine programs is not necessarily the same person who determines the programming, the time and tile of the programs and is the author or originator of the facts recorded in the compilation. Once the programs are broadcast, the time, title, nature and content of those broadcast programs are available to the public. A person wishing to compile a schedule of those broadcast programs by viewing them and recording all of that information does not, in the making of that second compilation, appropriate the work of the creator of the record of the programs in the Weekly Schedule. It is similar to a speech and the report of the speech ( Walter v Lane [1900] AC 539, cited in Desktop at [68] per Lindgren J); they are two different things and the authors are relevantly two different persons.

210 The skill and labour of creating the Aggregated Guides accessible to the public, including Ice, is in the content and the form in which the information is there presented. The Aggregated Guides are separate compilations of which the Nine programming information or "Nine Listings Content" represents only a part. They are created by the independent skill and labour of the Aggregators and do not reflect the precise content and arrangement of the Weekly Schedule. Nine does not claim copyright in the Aggregated Guides but says that it retains copyright in so much of those guides as contains the Nine Programming, which was contained in the Weekly Schedule. Ice does not appropriate the skill and labour expended by Nine in arranging the format or the content of the additional program information and the synopses. It created its own templates. It accesses the Aggregated Guides. Ice adopts its own format and provides its own content. It amends the time and title information for some programs that it has not "predicted" correctly. It utilises its own skill and labour, via its software system, to insert that information into the IceGuide. It does not take the skill and labour attributable to the form of the compilation. It does not take sufficient of the skill and labour of the content of the Aggregated Guides, let alone the Weekly Schedule, to constitute a substantial part.

211 In order to ascertain whether the taking of the slivers of time and title information, individually and cumulatively for a given week constitutes the taking of a substantial part of Nine's copyright work as it forms part of the Aggregated Guides, a number of factors must be taken into account:
 
 &#8226; Ice does not access the Weekly Schedule but the Aggregated Guides.
 &#8226; The time and title information of the Weekly Schedule does not include the information the subject of the Late Change Notices. 
 &#8226; As Ms Wieland stated, prime-time movies are never included in the Weekly Schedule and new programs may not be included. They are the subject of Late Change Notices. 
 &#8226; Strip programs may be scheduled for broadcast in the same timeslot by Nine for months and sometimes years. 
 &#8226; Programs with episodic series are also often scheduled in the same timeslots for extended periods of time. As already noted, for these programs, the time and title information may be of less qualitative importance than the synopses. 
 &#8226; Each compilation, the Weekly Schedule, the Aggregated Guides and the IceGuide includes the additional information and the synopses.
 &#8226; Ice refers to the whole of the time and title information in the Aggregated Guides but only takes "slivers" of it. Those "slivers" do not bear substantial importance in relation to the originality of the Weekly Schedule as a whole.
 &#8226; The synopses are, for each of the Weekly Schedule and the IceGuide, original works with commercial importance. 
 &#8226; The skill and labour engaged in by Nine for the creation of the time and title information is skill and labour that is expended for the purposes of broadcasting and as preparatory skill and labour for the purposes of the compilation.
 &#8226; The skill and labour expended and the originality of the Weekly Schedule relate not only to the information contained in that schedule but also to the arrangement and form of the information.
 &#8226; Ice does not take the arrangement or form.
 &#8226; Ice expends its own skill and labour and original work in the creation of the IceGuide which is not derived from Nine's copyright. This includes the creation of the templates, the software to amend the guide, the decisions on what to include in updating and amending the guide, the writing of the synopses and the presentation of the data.</text>

<tocase>Walter v Steinkopff [1892] 3 Ch 489</tocase>
<text>72 In the alternative, Nine characterises the late changes as divorced from and separate to the act of revising the underlying copyright work but as attracting their own copyright over a week-long period. While that information is a relatively small quantitative part of the totality of information, it is qualitatively important for Nine. As already noted, such information may be withheld from the Weekly Schedule for competitive reasons. However, Ice does not access the Late Change Notices. Ice refers to the information as to late changes when it accesses the Aggregated Guides. The Late Change Notice is no part of the Weekly Schedule. It is merely a notice or, over the week, a series of notices. If there is no copyright in news as such but only in the form in which it is expressed ( Walter v Steinkopff [1892] 3 Ch 489), it follows that there is no copyright in the subject matter of the Late Change Notices. Further, the Late Change Notices are not themselves incorporated into the Aggregated Guides but only the information that they contain.

73 A simple visual comparison of the Yahoo7 Guide and the YourTV Guide with the Weekly Schedule in Excel and text formats confirms that there are significant differences of "look, feel, and content" between those guides and the Weekly Schedule. For example:
 
 &#8226; The information in the Yahoo7 Guide and YourTV Guide is not selected, expressed or arranged in a broadcast week; it is in daily format. 
 &#8226; The time and title information is arranged in a horizontal grid rather than vertical columns. The synopses and some of the additional program information, although present, is not set out in the grid. That information only becomes visible when selected in a pop-up window. 
 &#8226; A "day" is expressed as a calendar day rather than from 6:00 am to 5:59 am the next day. 
 &#8226; Program finish times, duration and genre are displayed in the Yahoo7 Guide and the YourTV Guide. This information, save for the genre of movies, is not included in the Weekly Schedule.
 &#8226; The YourTV Guide discloses the program country and links to official program and related websites.
 &#8226; The YourTV Guide discloses, where applicable, the program cast. 
 &#8226; Closed captions, widescreen and high definition are not expressed by abbreviations in the YourTV Guide and the Yahoo7 Guide.

74 It would seem that the synopses included in the Weekly Schedule are in most cases incorporated in substantially the same or abbreviated form in the Aggregated Guides. A comparison of the program synopses as included in (relevantly) the Weekly Schedule, the YourTV Guide, the Yahoo7 Guide and OurGuide for a randomly selected day (4 October 2006) showed that OurGuide had the same synopses as the Weekly Schedule (save for two shortened synopses). HWW made minor edits to the synopses provided by Nine, which were reflected in the YourTV Guide and two other guides sourced from HWW, including the Yahoo7 Guide.</text>

<tocase>Skybase Nominees Pty Ltd v Fortuity Pty Ltd (1996) 36 IPR 529</tocase>
<text>116 Copyright in a literary work is infringed where a person, not being the owner of the copyright and without licence, does or authorises the doing in Australia of any act comprised in the copyright (s 36(1) of the Act). The owner of the copyright in a literary work has the exclusive right to do the acts set out in s 31(1)(a) of the Act. These acts relevantly include ' to reproduce the work in a material form ' (s 31(1)(a)(i)) and ' to communicate the work to the public ' (s 31(1)(a)(iv)). An ' infringing copy ' is defined in s 10(1) to mean, relevantly, a reproduction of the work, or of an adaptation of the work '. Infringement by reproduction is usually said to require first, a "sufficient degree" of similarity between the two works and, secondly, that there is a "causal connection" between the two works ( Gold Peg International Pty Ltd v Kovan Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 57 at [173]-[174] per Crennan J; Skybase Nominees Pty Ltd v Fortuity Pty Ltd (1996) 36 IPR 529 at 531 per Hill J; Desktop at [220] per Lindgren J). A reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the work is an infringement (s 14(1)(b)) of the Act).

182 Where the manner of presentation is the basis for the attraction of copyright, it may be that a presentation of the same information in different form would not infringe ( Victoria Park per Dixon J at 511). In such circumstances there may not have been a taking of a "substantial part", which is assessed by reference to the quantity and the quality of what is taken and the inter-relationship between them ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [70] per Lindgren J, cited in Gold Peg at [170]). It is a question of fact and degree (Crennan J in Gold Peg at [190]; also emphasised by McHugh and Kirby JJ in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2005] HCATrans 842).

<tocase>Townsend Controls Pty Ltd v Gilead (1989) 14 IPR 443</tocase>
<text>231 The prerequisite in s 202(1) is that a person is threatened with an action or proceeding. This refers to a proceeding not yet brought. "Threat" imports an intention to bring an action or ' an indication of probable evil to come ' ( Macquarie Dictionary (4th ed, 2005)). That is the commencement of the proceedings threatened. Once the proceedings have been commenced, the threat to commence those proceedings has ceased. The link between the threat and the commencement of legal proceedings and the need for a statutory remedy in the context of the comparable s 121 of the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) (then in force) was commented upon by von Doussa J in Townsend Controls Pty Ltd v Gilead (1989) 14 IPR 443 at 448. His Honour said that the purpose of the section was to provide a statutory remedy where a person makes a threat instead of enforcing the claimed monopoly by instituting proceedings for infringement.</text>
