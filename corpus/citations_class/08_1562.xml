<text>4 In these circumstances the Court of its own motion listed the matter for a directions hearing on 9 April 2008. At that directions hearing the Court directed the parties to file and serve submissions in relation to the disposition of the application pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act on or before 7 May 2008. Subsequent to this date and in light of the Full Court's decision in the matter of Gudjala People # 2 v Native Title Registrar [2008] FCAFC 157 delivered on 27 August 2008, parties were invited by the Court to file and serve any further submissions prior to the hearing of the application.

5 On 21 May 2008 the applicant filed submissions in relation to all the Collard applications currently before the Court today ('the Collard Submissions') pursuant to the Order of the Court made on 9 April 2008.

6 The effect of the Collard submissions across the applications appears to be to the effect that the Court should not dismiss them under s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act because they are likely to be withdrawn in exchange for some form of recognition by the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council. It is not said in what way that is to be achieved or the terms in which it might be achieved. Somehow, it is said, it would recognise the status of Mr and Mrs Collard who are the Applicants.</text>
