<tocase>Barnes v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 88 ; (2007) 242 ALR 601</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/88.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In the recent decision of Barnes v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2007] FCAFC 88 ; (2007) 242 ALR 601 , the Full Federal Court considered the question whether privilege attaches to copy documents, and confirmed that the test was whether the copy itself came into existence for the dominant purpose of giving legal advice or assistance. In that case, the Full Court considered there was an insufficiency of direct evidence as to the purpose of creation. Their Honours emphasised the need for focused and specific evidence as to the making of the copies in order to properly ground a claim for legal professional privilege. They observed at 605 that "verbal formulae and bare conclusory assertions of purpose are not sufficient to make out a claim for privilege".</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/88.html</AustLII>
<text>11 Jarra Creek submits that I should proceed to determine this issue, since the Visy parties have not agreed to be bound by the outcome of the appeal from the decision of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 88.

12 The Visy parties submit that it is premature to decide this issue now. They say that the Fifth List of Documents (pursuant to which they discovered and claimed privilege over the relevant documents) was only filed on 7 April 2008. Any challenges to those claims of privilege, it is said, will require an order for verification of the claims and substantive argument on the point.

13 It is not appropriate at this stage to determine whether the proofs of the Visy parties are privileged. However, I do not want to defer determination of this issue until the full appeal process from the decision of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 88 has been exhausted. This would delay the matter significantly, and the matter has already had a long history. Protracted delay is not acceptable.

14 For these reasons, I require that the Visy parties verify their claims of privilege forthwith so that the matter can proceed to argument and determination if the parties are not able to reach agreement on this point.

15 The problem connected to this issue is how documents which were provided to the ACCC by third parties, and then provided by the ACCC to the Visy parties during the ACCC proceeding, should be disclosed in this proceeding without prejudice to any claims of confidentiality or any interests which the third parties may wish to assert.</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 398</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/398.html</AustLII>
<text>7 After the hearing of this application, both Jarra Creek and the Visy parties filed with the Court outlines which identified issues arising for decision on this application. There are eight matters to be considered. The ACCC filed a short response in relation to issues 3, 5 and 8. In short form, the questions are:
 
1. Are the proofs of the ACCC and the proofs of the Visy parties subject to an implied undertaking in light of the decision of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 398? 
 
2. Are the proofs of the Visy parties privileged?
 
3. How should outstanding claims of confidentiality and prejudice by third parties in relation to documents adduced in the ACCC proceeding, which may be subject to implied undertakings as to their use, be resolved?
 
4. Are copy documents provided by the ACCC to the Visy parties namely, transcripts and exhibits, discovered documents and documents the subject of Notices to Produce privileged?
 
5. Should leave be granted to Jarra Creek to subpoena the ACCC to the extent that the Visy parties succeed in their privilege claims?
 
6. Should the further discovery sought by Jarra Creek be ordered?
 
7. Are the s 155 notices discoverable?

8. What form should the orders take?
 ISSUE 1 IS THERE AN IMPLIED UNDERTAKING? 
 
8 Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 398 held that documents provided by the Visy parties to the applicant in a different proceeding before the Court (that is, the ACCC proceeding) were not subject to an implied undertaking, and that they should therefore be produced to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd in the proceeding before her Honour. However, having made this order, her Honour, on the application of the ACCC, stayed the requirement for compliance for one month (which stay was later extended by Weinberg J until resolution of any application for leave to appeal from her Honour's judgment).

9 In my view, the reasons of her Honour are applicable to the present case. I also consider that the Visy parties should be immediately released from their implied undertaking, subject to the opportunity being given to any third parties to make submissions before disclosure of any documents in which they have an interest. Any interests of third parties which may be prejudiced should be protected under the regime prepared in relation to Issue 3 below.

10 It is important to note that Jarra Creek submitted that the implied undertaking automatically yields to orders for discovery which I made in this proceeding on 31 March 2008. I do not consider that those orders displace the implied undertaking, or that they were intended to do so.</text>

<text>28 The most relevant authority in relation to copy documents is the decision in Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501. In that case, the High Court undertook a detailed examination of legal professional privilege in circumstances where some original documents were not privileged, but a separate claim of privilege was advanced in respect of copies of those documents which were made for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice or for use in legal proceedings. It is important to note that, in Propend 188 CLR 510, the documents in question were not created by a stranger to the litigation.</text>

<text>29 In the leading case of Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 677, Barwick CJ expressed the general principles as to privilege in the following terms:
 '... a document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, should be privileged and excluded from inspection.' (Emphasis added.) 
From these observations of Barwick CJ, it is clear that he considered that privilege is to be determined not solely by reference to the purpose of the person who actually made the copy, but also by reference to the purpose of the person who directed or authorised the copy. Although his Honour was in a minority in that case in adopting a dominant purpose as opposed to a sole purpose test, his Honour's observations are apposite to present circumstances, particularly in light of the later conclusion of the High Court that privilege is determined by reference to the dominant purpose: see Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49.</text>

<tocase>Hartogen Energy Limited (In Liq) v The Australian Gas Light Company (1992) 36 FCR 557</tocase>
<text>30 In Hartogen Energy Limited (In Liq) v The Australian Gas Light Company (1992) 36 FCR 557 at 568-569, Gummow J observed that the purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact, and the legal issue is whether the purpose of supplying the material to the legal adviser accounts for the existence of the material. His Honour accepted that the relevant "purpose" will ordinarily be that of the maker of the documents, but his Honour also observed that privilege is attracted where the person who calls the document into existence does so in the bona fide belief that litigation will probably ensue. By way of example, his Honour referred to situations where solicitors commission the provision of a technical report with the consequence that the relevant intention will not be that of the report's author but the solicitor who requests it. Privilege in a copy document may therefore arise where a person requests that the original document be copied for his or her own purpose of providing legal advice or assistance.

31 The principles summarised by Gummow J in Hartogen 36 FCR at 568-569 were affirmed and applied by Batt JA in the Victorian Court of Appeal in Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (2002) 4 VR 332 at 338, with whom Charles and Callaway JJA agreed. In that case, the reports in question were commissioned by the solicitors. His Honour considered that the relevant purpose included the intention of a person under whose direction the relevant document is brought into existence.

33 Where it is necessary to determine the purpose for which a copy document has come into existence, it is appropriate to identify some person or entity from whom that purpose can be elicited. The authorities refer to "the maker" of the relevant document a description which, in the circumstances of copy documents, could be interpreted literally to mean the person who actually carries out the physical task of copying. To limit the concept of "purpose" to such a person is clearly too restrictive, and would run contrary to the authorities which refer to the purpose of the person who "authorised", "ordered" or "procured" the creation of a copy document, or "called the document into existence". In addition, some authorities regard as relevant the purpose of the person at whose "request" a document comes into existence. An example of such a person is a legal adviser who requests an expert or third party to provide a report for use in litigation: see Hartogen 36 FCR at 568-569.

34 In principle, it is not easy to see why the purpose of a lawyer who acts for a party should not be relevant, or indeed in some cases controlling, where he or she requests another person to provide copy documents for that particular purpose. In such a case the circumstances may indicate, when taken together with the terms of the request, or by clear implication from the request, that the documents are required for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice or assistance. In such a case, an accession to the request (by copying the documents) can properly be treated as being for the purpose of the legal adviser who called the documents into existence.

35 In my opinion, the copy documents produced by the ACCC in response to the requests by ABL come within the privilege which applies in respect of copy documents produced for legal advice or assistance or for use in reasonably anticipated legal proceedings. As in the present circumstances, where the evidence is that documents are requested by a solicitor solely for such a purpose, and the request is complied with by the third party without any qualification, it can be reasonably inferred that the copy documents were made in order to comply with the request and to carry out the purpose (be it either expressed or implied from the circumstances) for which the request was made. There is no evidence in this case to indicate that the ACCC had any other motive or purpose in making the copies available except to comply with the request by ABL. This conclusion applies in respect of all copy documents requested by ABL orally or in writing in relation to the ACCC proceeding, including those produced under any Notice to Produce issued by ABL to the ACCC.

36 In light of the above reasons, it is appropriate that Jarra Creek should pay the costs attributable to the determination of this issue relating to the privilege claim in respect of the copy documents.

37 Jarra Creek seeks an order that, to the extent that the Visy parties succeed in their privilege claims which were the subject of Issue 4 above, leave should be granted to Jarra Creek to subpoena the ACCC. Although the Visy parties do not oppose the granting of such leave, the ACCC submits that leave should not be granted: 
 
(a) until the privilege claims which were the subject of Issue 4 are determined; and
 
(b) because it is not appropriate for Jarra Creek to subpoena documents from the ACCC simply because it has been unsuccessful in obtaining those documents from the Visy parties by way of discovery.

38 In my view, it is appropriate to grant leave to issue the subpoenas. The request for leave is not opposed by the Visy parties, and the form of subpoena proposed by Jarra Creek is specific and certain in its terms. Accordingly, leave to issue the subpoena should be granted immediately, and not delayed as the ACCC contends.

39 By order 2 of its Amended Notice of Motion Jarra Creek sought an order that further discovery be granted. This order was intended to compel the Visy parties to discover and produce for inspection documents and categories of documents which were listed in two schedules to the Amended Notice of Motion.</text>
