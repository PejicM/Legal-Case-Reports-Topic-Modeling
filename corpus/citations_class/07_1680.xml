<tocase>Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170</tocase>

<text>2 As is clear from the decision of the High Court in Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170, great restraint should be exercised in allowing leave to appeal in matters of practice and procedure.

3 I do not see any arguable case that his Honour's discretion miscarried. In particular, it was not necessary for him to make express reference to what was obviously common ground, namely that the evidence in question was relevant. Nor was it necessary for him to restate the trite fact that there is a public interest in invalid patents not remaining on the register.</text>

<tocase>The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>4 The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 is not authority for the proposition that amendments, adjournments and other procedural indulgences must always be granted and that the balm of costs will always be sufficient. In this case his Honour made findings of fact as to the prejudice that would be suffered by Black &amp; Decker if this evidence was admitted. Those findings were open to him. His Honour was entitled to place considerable weight on the procedural record of GMCA. Whether or not criticism can be launched in this regard at Black &amp; Decker, the fact remains that time and again GMCA have sought to enlarge the case and produce further evidence without regard to the firm directions given by the Court.

5 This case is not concerned with particularly arcane technology, for expert evidence concerning which the parties might have to search throughout the world. It was incumbent on the parties to get their case in order long before now. The integrity of the court process is an important issue on which his Honour was entitled to place great weight.</text>
