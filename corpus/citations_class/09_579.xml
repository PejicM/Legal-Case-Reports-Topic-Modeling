<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1997/1408.html</AustLII>
<text>Background
 In this proceeding, Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation ("Walmbaar") applies under ss 50(2) and 61 (1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act") for a determination of the compensation payable under the Act in respect of acts which are said to have either extinguished or significantly impaired or otherwise affected the native title rights and interests of the Dingaal People determined by the Court on 8 December 1997 ( Erica Deeral (on behalf of herself and the Gamaay Peoples) and others v Gordon Charlie and others [1997] FCA 1408 per Beaumont J).

That determination is described as the Hopevale determination as, by its terms, the Court determined the native title rights and interests subsisting in 13 clans of indigenous people including the Dingaal People in land and waters on the eastern side of Cape York surrounding the community of Hopevale. The land the subject of the determination is described in the Deed of Agreement filed in support of the application for the Hopevale determination under s 87(1) of the Act as the "land and waters of the Hopevale Deed of Grant in Trust ('the dogit land'), to the high water mark" as detailed on a map attached to the Deed. It seems to be common ground that the land and waters of the Hopevale determination fall within Lot 35 on Crown Plan BS 222.

Walmbaar is a registered native title body corporate in relation to the Hopevale determination, for the purposes of the Act (ss 253 and 193 (2)(e)) and is the prescribed body corporate and agent for the Dingaal People for the purposes of ss 57(2) and 57 (3) of the Act and the Hopevale determination.

The "Rules" of the Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation contain these provisions.

These individuals listed in Schedule A are the leading members of the Baru, Yoren and Charlie families. Each of the indigenous respondents other than Brian Cobus is a member of Walmbaar.

On 25 February 2002, Beaumont J made a further order in the Hopevale determination proceeding directing, by Order 5, that Walmbaar "is the prescribed body corporate which, after becoming a registered native title body corporate, will perform the functions mentioned in s 57(3) of the Native Title Act 1993 for the Dingaal Clan". The reason for the long delay between that order and the Hopevale determination of 8 December 1997 is not clear.

Differences of opinion emerged between Gordon Charlie and others on the one hand and members of the Baru and Yoren families on the other as to whether the Dingaal People comprise descent members of the Baru and Yoren families notwithstanding the definitional matters contained in the Rules of Walmbaar ([16], Interpretation). For example, a notice convening a meeting for 21 June 2005 of "all Dingaalwarra and Biddi-Baru members" to be held at "Gungarde Office" in Cooktown was issued to Walmbaar members signed by Gordon Charlie at which meeting a resolution was to be proposed that Phillip Baru, Elaine McGreen and all Baru and Yoren members be expelled from Walmbaar and that "all Yoren and Baru descent members who are members of [Walmbaar] resign [their membership] as they belong to another clan and are not Dingaal clan descendents". The notice contained a pro forma notice of resignation and a commentary that Baru and Yoren family members are members of a separate clan called the Biddi-Baru clan. The meeting did not take place. Neither Phillip Baru nor Elaine McGreen nor any member of the Baru and Yoren families resigned their membership of Walmbaar.

Consistent with the notion that Baru and Yoren family members form part of a different clan, steps were taken in 2005 to incorporate under the ACA Act a corporation described as Biddi-Baru Aboriginal Corporation which by rule 2 of its Rules defines native title holders in respect of relevant land as members of the Baru and Yoren families from the Cape Flattery area. Mr Testro, a legal officer employed by the Land Council, deposes in his affidavit that members of the Baru and Yoren families did not establish the Biddi-Baru Corporation; they continue to assert membership of Walmbaar on the footing that they are members of the Dingaal clan as recited in the Rules of Walmbaar; and they are seeking to establish who caused the new corporation to be formed on that footing.</text>

<tocase>Dingaal Tribe v State of Queensland and Ors [2003] FCA 999</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/999.html</AustLII>
<text>The position adopted in the notice signed by Gordon Charlie was consistent with Gordon Charlie's contentions before Cooper J in 2003 in Dingaal Tribe v State of Queensland and Ors [2003] FCA 999 that "under the traditional law and customs of the Dingaal people, he is the only person entitled, and thereby authorised, to make the claim for native title on behalf of the claim group" (at [14]). In that proceeding (QG6004 of 1998), Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie as joint applicants sought a native title determination in respect of particular lands and waters on behalf of the Dingaal tribe. Gary Yoren, Ned Yoren, Elaine Baru and Louis Charlie applied pursuant to s 66B of the Act for an order that Yoren, Yoren and Baru replace Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie as applicants on the footing that resolutions passed at a meeting at Hopevale on 14 April 2003 removed the authority of the existing applicants to maintain the claim on behalf of the claimant group. Cooper J found that notice of meeting had been given directly or indirectly to all members of the Dingaal claim group and that there was no traditional law or custom binding on the claim group preventing them from terminating the authority of Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie (at [17] and [20]). Cooper J concluded that the authority of Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie to continue to act as applicants had been withdrawn by resolution of the meeting of the Dingaal clan and accordingly orders were made replacing Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie with Gary Yoren, Ned Yoren and Elaine Baru.</text>

<tocase>Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council [2006] FCA 1418</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1418.html</AustLII>
<text>Proceeding QG6004 of 1998 was a claim by the Dingaal People of native title rights and a claim of connection with Lizard Island and the islands offshore from Cape Flattery (and associated waters). On 28 February 2006, Dingaal clan members convened at the Church Hall in Hopevale to consider a presentation in relation to the claim by the National Native Title Tribunal, a report and presentation by a consultant anthropologist, Dr Fiona Powell, and a presentation on future tasks to be undertaken by the Land Council. The claim group members unanimously resolved to amend the claim to include other claimant groups asserting rights in relation to the land and waters, namely, the Thanil, Nguuruumungu, Gulaal, Ngaatha and Thittaar Peoples. That resolution made necessary an amendment to the application so as to alter the area of land and waters the subject of the claim and the composition of the claim groups. The Land Council sought to convene a meeting of Dingaal members on 31 October 2006 at 11.00am at Hopevale to authorise amendments to the native title application. Gordon Charlie sought to restrain the conduct of the meeting that morning on the footing that the Charlie family incorporates a sub-group family described as the Brim family and members of that family had not been invited to the meeting nor incorporated within the claim. The Brim family members were said to be in tension with the Baru and Yoren families. Gordon Charlie was unsuccessful in his application for an injunction ( Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council [2006] FCA 1418).

The meeting did not proceed on 31 October 2006 due to the death of Mr Gary Yoren, an applicant member of the Dingaal claim group. The authorisation meeting was reconvened for 29 November 2006 and 30 November 2006 at Hopevale. Gordon Charlie sought to restrain the meeting on the morning of 29 November 2006. He did so based on the contention that the Baru and Yoren People are not part of the Dingaal clan. He contended that Brim family members are part of the Dingaal clan through Charlie family members and therefore seven identified members of the Brim family and some family members associated with some of those individuals, ought to have been invited to the meeting. Gordon Charlie contended that Brim family members ought to be joined in the claim; they derive their rights through identified Charlie clan members; and Baru and Yoren families are not members of the Dingaal clan. In that proceeding, Dr Fiona Powell swore an affidavit concerning her extensive anthropological research in relation to the Dingaal claim. Dr Powell said that she had revealed no evidence which suggested a connection between the Charlie family and the Brim family or connections on the part of the Brim family to the area claimed in the Dingaal application. Dr Powell identified the foundation for that view.</text>

<tocase>Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1683</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1683.html</AustLII>
<text>The relevance of that proceeding for present purposes is simply that Gordon Charlie continued to assert a different composition of or foundation for the Dingaal clan notwithstanding the Hopevale determination and the terms recited in the Rules of Walmbaar adopted by Gordon Charlie and other Charlie family members. First, the Dingaal clan was said to properly embrace the Brim family and secondly, the Baru and Yoren families were said not to be part of the Dingaal clan. Gordon Charlie was unsuccessful in the injunction application ( Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1683).

In that proceeding, Gordon Charlie contended that a meeting of Dingaal native title clan members and some non-members took place at Cooktown at the "Lions Park" on 3 July 2005. The meeting was said to have passed a number of resolutions including a resolution that only Charlie family members have standing to maintain a Dingaal clan native title claim. The minutes of the contended meeting record the attendance of Vernon Yoren, Henry Baru, Elaine Baru, Phyllis Greenway (nee Baru) and Kevin Yoren. However, the evidence of a Hopevale Lutheran Minister, Reverend Jantke, who presided at the relevant burial services and who had possession of Lutheran Church records, demonstrated that all of those individuals had died well before 3 July 2005 which caused the Court to conclude that the minutes of the meeting and contentions in relation to the meeting were unreliable.

That evidence, of course, was relevant only for the purposes of the proceeding in question. However, the fact of that controversy in that proceeding remains a relevant historical fact in explaining the subsequent chronology of events by which the resolution of the intra-indigenous issues concerning the composition of the Dingaal clan were sought to be resolved.</text>

<tocase>DPP v Webb [2000] NSWSC 859</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/859.html</AustLII>
<text>A decision to institute a proceeding to seek and obtain a compensation determination in relation to those matters identified particularly at Schedules E, I and J of the application, under the provisions of the Act, and the analysis in that proceeding of the amount of compensation by reference to just terms or the similar compensable interest test in respect of acts said to have either extinguished or significantly impaired or otherwise affected the native title rights and interests of the Dingaal People as determined by the Court on 8 December 1997, is a decision "regarding" native title. The scope of an application under s 50(2) can be seen in the criteria to be applied under s 51(1) for determining compensation. Section 51(1) provides that subject to subsection (3) the entitlement to compensation under Division 2, 2A, 2B, 3 or 4 is an entitlement on just terms to compensate the native title holders for any loss, diminution, impairment or other effect of the act on their native title rights and interests . A decision to commence a proceeding for compensation and engage, on behalf of the native title holders, an analytical process which seeks to identify any loss, diminution, impairment or other effect of an act on their native title rights and interests is necessarily a decision regarding native title for the purposes of Rule 9(1). The use of the word "regarding" in the context of the Rules and the functions to be performed by Walmbaar is necessarily a word of wide application. It is intended to have a wide application, in its context ( DPP v Webb [2000] NSWSC 859 at [17] to[29] per O'Keefe J).

There is no sound basis for importing the definition of "native title decision" in Regulation 8(1) of the NT (PB) Regulations into the construction of the Rules of Walmbaar either directly or analogically. The scope and operation of Regulation 8(1) is discussed shortly.

Accordingly, the decision to institute a compensation application ought to have been made in accordance with the decision-making requirements of Rule 9 of Walmbaar's Rules. The decision to commence proceedings was taken by the Committee of Walmbaar on 4 July 2006. There is simply no evidence of whether the common law members were given notice of the proposed decision; or of whether they expressed views about it or were engaged by the Committee in any formal or informal consultation process. The Committee members are not identified. Neither Gordon Charlie nor Ruth Schaefer filed any affidavit on the motion notwithstanding that each of them might have spoken directly to the events in issue. No minutes of the meeting are produced. Walmbaar has changed its position by, in effect, abandoning Gordon Charlie's original contention that the decision to commence the proceeding was the subject of a resolution of 75% of the common law holders obtained at a meeting on 3 July 2005. That position that was relied upon not only by Gordon Charlie in his affidavit sworn on 22 November 2006 but also by him on 11 February 2008 by reason of Mr Black's letter of that date asserting reliance on the resolution. Walmbaar contends in submissions that there are two decisions which confer authority to institute the application. The first is the resolution at the meeting on 3 July 2005 and the second is the decision of the Committee made on 4 July 2006. Walmbaar says that the only evidence concerning a vote by common law holders is the evidence of Gordon Charlie contained in his affidavit of 22 November 2006. However, the primary contentions of Walmbaar which are recited in Mr Black's letter, rather than the subject of an affidavit by Gordon Charlie as to the facts, place reliance upon the authority of the Committee and the decision it took on 4 July 2006. The Committee cannot act independently of the decision-making process contained in Rule 9. Rules 6(1) and 6(2) of Walmbaar's Rules which set out the objects taken in conjunction with Rule 12 which sets out the powers of the Committee, do not confer power upon the Committee to make decisions regarding native title without complying with Rule 9(1).</text>

<text>In addition, the claim as framed goes beyond the land and waters the subject of the Hopevale determination. Before a determination as to compensation can be made by the Court in respect of relevant lands and waters, there must first be a determination of native title in relation to those lands and waters ( Jango and Ors v Northern Territory and Ors [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150 per Sackville J; Jango v Northern Territory [2007] FCAFC 101 ; (2007) 159 FCR 531 at [66] [74] and [83] per French, Finn and Mansfield JJ). To the extent that the compensation application goes beyond the land and waters the subject of the Hopevale determination, it must necessarily fail.
