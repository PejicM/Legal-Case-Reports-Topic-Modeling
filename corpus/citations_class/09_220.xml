<text>At para 31(ii) it is submitted that, "An explicit denial from the relevant decision-makers that a prohibited reason formed part of their decision-making will not generally discharge the onus of showing the conduct was not for a prohibited reason". Reliance is placed upon the decision of Buchanan J in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [128] - [129] and to that of Merkel J in Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Ansett Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 441 ; (2000) 175 ALR 173 at [76] . However neither citation supports the proposition. Both references contain observations concerning the evidence of particular witnesses. It would be curious if witnesses appearing on behalf of an employer were to be put into a special category in which their evidence was to be treated as generally not discharging the onus of proving a matter which was peculiarly within their knowledge. It is one thing to say that denials which are self-serving should be closely scrutinized in the light of all other evidence. It is quite another to say, as the applicants have in the present case, that a particular class of evidence will not generally discharge an onus to which it relates. In General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 51 ALJR 233, at 239, Gibbs J expressly disapproved of such an approach. His Honour said: 
 ... However, it would in my opinion be wrong to think that there is any special difficulty in the way of an employer who seeks to prove that in dismissing an employee he was not actuated by the fact that the employee was a shop steward or other delegate of an organization. The onus of proving that the fact that the employee held the position was not a substantial and operative factor in the dismissal is to be discharged according to the balance of probabilities and is not to be made heavier by any presumption that if an employee who is dismissed for disruptive activities happens to be a shop steward the later circumstance must have had something to do with his dismissal. If in the present case evidence had been given by the directors responsible that the employee was dismissed because he was guilty of misconduct or because his work was unsatisfactory, and that in dismissing him they were not influenced by the fact that he was a shop steward or indeed that he was dismissed in spite of that fact, and that evidence had been accepted, the onus would have been discharged.</text>

Merkel J, in Ansett at [72], explained the last paragraph as follows: 
 Subject to one qualification, the authorities establish that a clear line exists between a dismissal for activities that fall within para (n) (previously para (f)) and a dismissal by reason of the holding of a union office which falls within para (a). The qualification is that a dismissal based on the activities of a union delegate or officer must fall within para (n), rather than para (a), if it is to be for a proscribed reason, unless the reasons proffered by the employer and accepted by the Court do not "exclude the possibility that (the dismissal) was associated with the circumstance that the (employee) was a (delegated officer)": see Mason J at 619 in GMH v Bowling . As noted above and relevantly, for present purposes, his Honour added that if the possibility was no more than "slender" the circumstance might be disregarded as one which was not a substantial and operative factor in the decision. ... Rather, his Honour was stating that in a case in which the dismissal of a union official or delegate occurs in circumstances that are closely associated with the activities of the employee in that capacity, the employer carries the onus of rebutting the very real possibility that the dismissal was associated with the circumstance that the employee was an official or delegate. A failure to do so can result in the Court determining that, under the statutory scheme, the dismissal was for a proscribed reason.
 (Original Emphasis)

In the present case One Steel must demonstrate that it did not dismiss Mr Harrison for reason of his membership of the union or his position as a delegate. As it asserts that it dismissed him by reason of his conduct, it must show that notwithstanding any apparent association between such conduct and his union membership or position, such membership or position played no part in the decision.

The applicants, at para 27 of their opening outline of submissions, effectively submit that: 
 Part 16 protects more than the formal right to belong to a trade union. It also protects the rights to participation in the lawful activities of a trade union. Prior to the 2006 amendments to the [Workplace Relations Act], Part XA of the pre-reform Act contain similar provisions dealing with freedom of association. The corresponding provisions of the pre-reform and post-reform Act are as follows: 

 
 &#8226; S 298K became s 792;
 &#8226; S 298L became s 793; and
 &#8226; S 298V became s 809.

The submission appears to be inconsistent with the observations made in Bowling as explained in Ansett . The applicants also rely upon the decision of the Full Court in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at [107] , that of Merkel J in Ansett at [63] and that of Wilcox J in Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal and Clerical Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 184 ALR 641 at [72] - [73] , citing his Honour's earlier remarks in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1008. I suspect that the applicants have misunderstood these cases. The proposition identified at [107] in Davids related to the purpose of the former Act as a whole and, in particular, Part XA. It was not concerned with the distinction between status as a member, office holder or delegate, on the one hand, and actions in advancing the industrial interests of the union, on the other. Further, I note that the quotation of the relevant extract in the applicants' opening outline is inaccurate in one respect. In the report the relevant extract is as follows: 
 In the context of the Act, Part XA does not stand alone. It is aimed at ensuring that employees may band together, if they wish, for collective bargaining of the type provided for in the Act to achieve the broader objectives of the Act as contained in s 3. ... That which is protected by such legislation is more than the right to be a member. It is the right to participate in protected union activities, including the taking of collective industrial action against an employer to seek to obtain better industrial conditions ... .

The applicants also refer to the decision in Ansett at [63] where Merkel J said: 
 The object of ss 298K, 298L and 298V, as well as their statutory predecessors, has not been in doubt. It has been said to be to "remove fear of adverse action by an employer against an employee taking union office and performing the functions of that office" ( Bowling v GMH at 210 per Smithers and Evatt JJ) and to "ensure the threat of dismissal or discriminatory treatment cannot be used by an employer to destroy or frustrate an employee's right to join an industrial association and to take an active role in that association to promote industrial interests to both the employee and the association ...".

The applicants also refer to the decision of Marshall J in Elliott v Kodak Australasia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 807 ; (2001) 108 IR 23 and to that of North J in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Belandra Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 910 ; (2003) 126 IR 165 at [150] . Each case involved an examination of the history of the relevant industrial legislation. Both North and Marshall JJ concluded that s 298L(1)(a) of the Act, itself an analogue of s 793(1)(a), had an analogue in s 9(1) of the 1904 Act. Their Honours concluded that s 298L(1)(a) should be given the same breadth of operation as had been attributed to s 9(1), notwithstanding the fact that in s 298L(1) (as in s 793(1)) subsequent provisions might suggest that s 298L(1) should be given a narrower meaning. In Kodak , this view led Marshall J to conclude that the word "delegate" in s 298L(1)(a) should have a wider meaning than might be suggested by other parts of s 298L(1). In Belandra North J concluded that s 298L(1)(a) was intended to cover "conduct taken against employees because they had taken action as members of a union, and because a union had taken action as an incident of that employee's membership of a union." To the extent that this implies that s 793(1)(a) addresses conduct as well as union membership or standing as an officer or delegate, it is inconsistent with the observations made by Mason J in Bowling . Unfortunately, it seems that neither his Honour nor Marshall J was referred to that decision or to the decision of Merkel J in Ansett . I proceed upon the basis that ss 792(1)(a) and 793(1)(a) proscribe dismissal because of union membership or status as an officer or delegate, but not because of conduct. However conduct is relevant to the question in the way explained by Mason J in Bowling .</text>

It is quite another to say, as the applicants have in the present case, that a particular class of evidence will not generally discharge an onus to which it relates. In General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 51 ALJR 233, at 239, Gibbs J expressly disapproved of such an approach. His Honour said: 
 ... However, it would in my opinion be wrong to think that there is any special difficulty in the way of an employer who seeks to prove that in dismissing an employee he was not actuated by the fact that the employee was a shop steward or other delegate of an organization. The onus of proving that the fact that the employee held the position was not a substantial and operative factor in the dismissal is to be discharged according to the balance of probabilities and is not to be made heavier by any presumption that if an employee who is dismissed for disruptive activities happens to be a shop steward the later circumstance must have had something to do with his dismissal. If in the present case evidence had been given by the directors responsible that the employee was dismissed because he was guilty of misconduct or because his work was unsatisfactory, and that in dismissing him they were not influenced by the fact that he was a shop steward or indeed that he was dismissed in spite of that fact, and that evidence had been accepted, the onus would have been discharged.

It is then submitted that by analogy to the position addressed by the High Court in Bowling , the evidence indicated that Mr Harrison was treated as a troublemaker, and that such categorization of him must have had something to do with his position in the union. I will deal with the decision in Bowling at a later stage. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that even if Mr Harrison could be accurately described as a troublemaker, he was not a troublemaker in the sense in which that expression is generally used in the context of industrial relations. Whatever else he might have done, there is no suggestion that his conduct provoked industrial unrest directed against One Steel. One Steel's concern was, at all times, that he was causing conflict amongst employees.

It is then submitted that Mr Harrison's dismissal was "so disproportionate to [his] conduct ... as to confirm that factors other than the sticker incident were operative". For reasons which I have touched upon, I do not accept that proposition. I similarly do not accept that the acceleration of the disciplinary process was inexplicable. I do not accept that in the circumstances of this case Mr Harrison's conduct in wearing the sticker was "a relatively trivial matter". Nor do I accept that it was arguable that One Steel had no lawful right to direct Mr Harrison to remove the sticker, or that such direction was unreasonable. I do not accept the characterization of the final warning given in connection with the incident on 27 October 2007 as being inexplicable other than by reference to Mr Harrison's union activity.

It is said that Mr Harrison was not given an opportunity to respond or comment before he was given the final written warning. However he was absent on sick leave from shortly after the incident and was called in specifically to be given the warning. He had been interviewed by Mr Hasemann on 27 October 2007, in the presence of Mr Croxford, Mr McGuire and Mr Antal. He subsequently filed a written complaint with Ms Rankin. It is difficult to see that any useful purpose would have been served by a further interview. There were clear differences between his and Mr Tavita's versions. There was some, apparently independent, support for both versions. Mr Lawson supported Mr Tavita's version. Mr Wally supported Mr Harrison's version. However he said that he had not heard what was said, and that it was "something along the lines of, 'What if we take it outside?' ". He heard Mr Tavita say, "Shut up!" Mr Frahm's evidence supported aspects of both versions. In any event, it was open to Mr Harrison to raise any further concerns at the meeting on 28 November 2007 when he was given his warning. It may have been prudent for management to have asked Mr Harrison if he had any further comments, but I do not accept that the failure to do so could, in the circumstances, be taken as indicative of some prejudice against him, attributable to his union position or otherwise.

Concerning the warning, it is submitted (at para 54) that, "Mr Allard stated that other matters (which were never mentioned to Mr Harrison even at the time of issue of the Final Warning but were raised for the first time in subsequent AIRC proceedings) were taken into account". This is said to be supported by Mr Allard's evidence at TS 20 ll 25-43. The page reference is incorrect. It should be TS 80. Mr Allard said that in issuing the final written warning he took into account the matters which were subsequently raised in the AIRC. I have demonstrated that those matters, or most of them, had been previously raised with Mr Harrison. I do not accept that Mr Harrison was treated unfairly in connection with the final warning. The thrust of Mr Allard's evidence was that the decision was based upon the ongoing friction between him and Mr Tavita and a desire to stop it. As I have previously said, much of the applicants' criticism of One Steel's conduct in connection with the final written warning was based upon the misconception that the incident on 27 October 2007 was provoked by Mr Tavita when it was, at least in part, provoked by Mr Harrison. Mr Tavita's response may have been extreme (if Mr Harrison's version be accepted), but he did not initiate the confrontation. For reasons which I have given, I also do not accept that Mr Harrison was singled out for special treatment when he was directed not to discuss union matters on the shop floor. I decline to draw any adverse inference from his allegation that he was docked half-an-hour's pay for being two minutes late for work.

At para 59 reference is made to Ms Rankin's note of a meeting concerning the incident on 1 June 2007. The note said: 
 Shane Harrison is a Union member and has talked to the Union on the phone after this incident saying that 'they are trying to fuck me over'. Graham H said that Shane is a ring leader to push union involvement and membership and he has his followers.

The applicants submit that analogues of s 793(1)(a) in earlier legislation have been construed as protecting conduct, and that there is no justification for giving it a narrower operation. It is therefore necessary to examine the cases. A convenient starting point is the decision of the High Court in Bowling . That was an appeal from a decision of the Australian Industrial Court convicting the appellant of an offence against s 5(1) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) (the "1904 Act") which provided relevantly: 
 An employer shall not dismiss an employee, or injure him in his employment, or alter his position to his prejudice, by reason of the circumstance that the employee 
 (a) is or has been, or proposes, or has at any time proposed, to become, an officer, delegate or member of an organization, or of an association that has applied to be registered as an organization; or
 ...
 (f) being an officer, delegate or member of an organization, has done, or proposes to do, an act or thing which is lawful for the purpose of furthering or protecting the industrial ... interests of the organization or its members, being an act or thing done within the limits of authority expressly conferred on him by the organization in accordance with the rules of the organization.

The 1904 Act contained an evidentiary section similar in effect to s 809(1) of the Act. The appellant had dismissed the respondent who was a shop steward. The putative reason for the dismissal was that he was a "bad operator", meaning that he was not competent in his work. There was also some suggestion that he was considered to be a troublemaker, deliberately disrupting production and thereby setting a bad example to others. Although the plant superintendent was called to give evidence as to the reason for his dismissal, it appeared that the decision had actually been made at head office in Melbourne. At first instance the Industrial Court concluded that the dismissal was not for the stipulated reason, namely the respondent's poor work record and attitude to his job, this conclusion being based upon an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. One member of the Industrial Court (Woodward J) concluded that the superintendent had been influenced in his decision by a belief that the respondent had deliberately disrupted production on several occasions and was setting a bad example to others. On appeal the appellant asserted that this was the real reason for the dismissal. The majority (Gibbs, Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ) appear to have accepted such assertion. However, as Mason J observed at 241: 
 It is to my mind a very considerable leap forward to say that this finding in itself is a comprehensive expression of the reasons for dismissal and that they were disassociated from the circumstance that the respondent was a shop steward. No doubt this is an advance which could be made if officers of the appellant had said in evidence "We dismissed him because he was a troublemaker, because he was deliberately disrupting production and setting a bad example and we did so without regard at all to his position as a shop steward" and that evidence had been accepted. Yet this evidence was not given and, even if it had been given, there may have been a question as to its reliability. Once it is said that the appellant dismissed him because he was deliberately disrupting production and was setting a bad example it is not easy to say without more that this had nothing to do with his being a shop steward. Although the activities in question did not fall within his responsibilities as a shop steward his office gave him a status in the workforce and a capacity to lead or influence other employees, a circumstance of which the appellant could not have been unaware. It would be mere summise or speculation, unsupported by evidence, to suppose that the appellant's management, if concerned as to the bad example he was setting, divorced that consideration from the circumstance that he was a shop steward.

Of more general importance is the following extract which appears at 242: 
 It was suggested that even if the appellant's management had regard to the respondent's position as a shop steward in dismissing him, that was not enough to bring the case within s 5(1)(a). The short answer to this suggestion is that s 5(1)(a) does not proscribe the circumstances which it lists as the sole or predominant reasons for dismissal. It is sufficient if the circumstance is a substantial and operative factor. And it does not cease to be such a factor because it is coupled with other circumstances or because regard is had to it in association with other circumstances not mentioned in the section. 

 
 The appellant sought to give emphasis to the distinction to be drawn between section 5(1)(a) and s 5(1)(f) and argued that the activities of a shop steward fall under par (f) and not par (a). So much may be conceded, but this does not avail the appellant in the present case because we are concerned not with activities undertaken by the respondent in his capacity as a shop steward but with activities otherwise undertaken and the example that he set to others in which his position as a shop steward was of particular significance.

The submission appears to be inconsistent with the observations made in Bowling as explained in Ansett . The applicants also rely upon the decision of the Full Court in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at [107] , that of Merkel J in Ansett at [63] and that of Wilcox J in Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal and Clerical Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 184 ALR 641 at [72] - [73] , citing his Honour's earlier remarks in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1008. I suspect that the applicants have misunderstood these cases. The proposition identified at [107] in Davids related to the purpose of the former Act as a whole and, in particular, Part XA. It was not concerned with the distinction between status as a member, office holder or delegate, on the one hand, and actions in advancing the industrial interests of the union, on the other. Further, I note that the quotation of the relevant extract in the applicants' opening outline is inaccurate in one respect. In the report the relevant extract is as follows:

That which is protected by such legislation is more than the right to be a member. It is the right to participate in protected union activities, including the taking of collective industrial action against an employer to seek to obtain better industrial conditions ... .

This proposition, too, was concerned with the overall effect of the sections and not with the areas of operation of the individual paragraphs of s 298K, the predecessor of s 793(1). Similar comments apply to the extract from the judgment of Wilcox J in BHP Steel to which his Honour referred in Greater Dandenong . In Finance Sector Union of Australia v Australian &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (2002) 114 IR 352 , Wilcox J applied the decision in Bowling as I have explained it. See that decision at [173] and [187]. See also the decision of Branson J in The Community and Public Sector Union v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1397 at [114] .

The applicants also refer to the decision of Marshall J in Elliott v Kodak Australasia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 807 ; (2001) 108 IR 23 and to that of North J in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Belandra Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 910 ; (2003) 126 IR 165 at [150] . Each case involved an examination of the history of the relevant industrial legislation. Both North and Marshall JJ concluded that s 298L(1)(a) of the Act, itself an analogue of s 793(1)(a), had an analogue in s 9(1) of the 1904 Act. Their Honours concluded that s 298L(1)(a) should be given the same breadth of operation as had been attributed to s 9(1), notwithstanding the fact that in s 298L(1) (as in s 793(1)) subsequent provisions might suggest that s 298L(1) should be given a narrower meaning. In Kodak , this view led Marshall J to conclude that the word "delegate" in s 298L(1)(a) should have a wider meaning than might be suggested by other parts of s 298L(1). In Belandra North J concluded that s 298L(1)(a) was intended to cover "conduct taken against employees because they had taken action as members of a union, and because a union had taken action as an incident of that employee's membership of a union." To the extent that this implies that s 793(1)(a) addresses conduct as well as union membership or standing as an officer or delegate, it is inconsistent with the observations made by Mason J in Bowling . Unfortunately, it seems that neither his Honour nor Marshall J was referred to that decision or to the decision of Merkel J in Ansett . I proceed upon the basis that ss 792(1)(a) and 793(1)(a) proscribe dismissal because of union membership or status as an officer or delegate, but not because of conduct. However conduct is relevant to the question in the way explained by Mason J in Bowling .</text>

<text>The extent of an employee's obligation to comply with directions given by an employer appears from the reasons of Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in The King v Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company Limited; ex parte Halliday and Sullivan [1938] HCA 44 ; (1938) 60 CLR 601 at 621-622. His Honour said: 
 If a command relates to the subject matter of the employment and involves no illegality, the obligation of the servant to obey it depends at common law upon its being reasonable. In other words, the lawful commands of an employer which an employee must obey are those which fall within the scope of the contract of service and are reasonable. ... But what is reasonable is not to be determined, so to speak, in vacuo . The nature of the employment, the established usages affecting it, the common practices which exist and the general provisions of the instrument, in this case an award, governing the relationship, supply considerations by which the determination of what is reasonable must be controlled.</text>

<text>For present purposes a useful example of the application of the general rule is to be found in the decision of the Full Court in Australian Telecommunications Commission v Hart (1982) 43 ALR 165. In that case an employee of Telecom was charged with disciplinary offences for refusing to obey a direction that he refrain from wearing a caftan and thongs to work. The majority (Fox and Sheppard JJ) concluded that the employee was obliged to comply with the direction. At 170, Fox J (Sheppard J concurring) cited Harvey: Industrial Relations and Employment Law 1982 and the decision in Boychuk v K.J. Symons Holdings Ltd [1977] IRLR 396 as authority for the proposition that: 
 ... a reasonable employer ... can be allowed to decide what, upon reflection and mature consideration, could be offensive to the customers and the fellow employees ... .</text>

I suspect that the applicants have misunderstood these cases. The proposition identified at [107] in Davids related to the purpose of the former Act as a whole and, in particular, Part XA. It was not concerned with the distinction between status as a member, office holder or delegate, on the one hand, and actions in advancing the industrial interests of the union, on the other. Further, I note that the quotation of the relevant extract in the applicants' opening outline is inaccurate in one respect. In the report the relevant extract is as follows: 
 In the context of the Act, Part XA does not stand alone. It is aimed at ensuring that employees may band together, if they wish, for collective bargaining of the type provided for in the Act to achieve the broader objectives of the Act as contained in s 3. ... That which is protected by such legislation is more than the right to be a member. It is the right to participate in protected union activities, including the taking of collective industrial action against an employer to seek to obtain better industrial conditions ... .

In the outline, the word "collective" has been deleted before the word "industrial" in the last sentence. Mr Harrison's conduct could hardly be described as "collective action". However, as I have said, the decision in Davids says nothing about the respective areas of operation of s 793(1)(a) and s 793(1)(o).</text>

Each case involved an examination of the history of the relevant industrial legislation. Both North and Marshall JJ concluded that s 298L(1)(a) of the Act, itself an analogue of s 793(1)(a), had an analogue in s 9(1) of the 1904 Act. Their Honours concluded that s 298L(1)(a) should be given the same breadth of operation as had been attributed to s 9(1), notwithstanding the fact that in s 298L(1) (as in s 793(1)) subsequent provisions might suggest that s 298L(1) should be given a narrower meaning. In Kodak , this view led Marshall J to conclude that the word "delegate" in s 298L(1)(a) should have a wider meaning than might be suggested by other parts of s 298L(1). In Belandra North J concluded that s 298L(1)(a) was intended to cover "conduct taken against employees because they had taken action as members of a union, and because a union had taken action as an incident of that employee's membership of a union." To the extent that this implies that s 793(1)(a) addresses conduct as well as union membership or standing as an officer or delegate, it is inconsistent with the observations made by Mason J in Bowling . Unfortunately, it seems that neither his Honour nor Marshall J was referred to that decision or to the decision of Merkel J in Ansett . I proceed upon the basis that ss 792(1)(a) and 793(1)(a) proscribe dismissal because of union membership or status as an officer or delegate, but not because of conduct.

<text>I have already concluded that Mr Allard's direction was both lawful and reasonable, that Mr Harrison was obliged to comply with it and that he did not do so. The only remaining question is whether or not his conduct entitled One Steel to terminate his employment summarily. The applicants submit that Mr Harrison could only be dismissed summarily for serious misconduct, relying upon the following passage from the reasons for judgment of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Blyth Chemicals Ltd v Bushnell [1933] HCA 8 ; (1933) 49 CLR 66 at 81-82: 
 Conduct which in respect of important matters is incompatible with the fulfilment of an employee's duty, or involves an opposition, or conflict between his interest and his duty to his employer, or impedes the faithful performance of his obligations, or is destructive of the necessary confidence between employer and employee, is a ground of dismissal ... . But the conduct of the employee must itself involve the incompatibility, conflict or impediment or be destructive of confidence. An actual repugnance between his act and his relationship must be found. It is not enough that ground for uneasiness as to its future conduct arises.</text>

<text>A number of other cases are of interest. The first is the decision of Wootten J in Scharmann v APIA Club Ltd (1983) 6 IR 157. At 164 his Honour said, concerning summary dismissal: 
 Some of the older cases virtually treated it as a rule of law that disobedience to a lawful order gave the employer a right to dismiss, but the modern is that: "One act of disobedience or misconduct can justify dismissal only if it is of a nature which goes to show (in effect) that the servant is repudiating the contract, or one of its essential conditions. ..." The disobedience must at least have the quality that it is "wilful": it does (in other words) connote a deliberate flouting of the essential contractual conditions.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1924/45.html</AustLII>
<text>Wootten J then referred to the decision of Isaacs ACJ in Adami v Maison De Luxe Limited [1924] HCA 45 ; (1924) 35 CLR 143 at 148-9. In that case the Acting Chief Justice rejected the proposition that, "wilful disobedience of a lawful order", meant, "simply conscious disobedience of an order, obedience to which is found after litigation to be in fact and in law within the range of duty", and continued: 
 The proposition asserts that, provided ultimately the order is found to be within the scope of the contract, it matters not how isolated and trivial the occasion may have been, how unimportant the disobedience in relation to the employer's affairs, how doubtful in fact or law the legality of the order may have been, how bona fide and reasonable may have been the contention of the employee or how clearly his action was intended and explained at the time as defence only and not in any way as defiance. That is a proposition I find it impossible to accept.

The other members of the Court (Gavan, Duffy and Starke JJ) did not address this question. At 151-152 Isaacs ACJ continued: 
 But the effect of the word "wilful" varies, and, as I have said, the only universal guide is to ascertain from its surroundings what the word is intended to connote. One commanding circumstance is to ascertain the subject matter as a totality of which it is predicated that it must be wilful. Here the subject matter is not "disobedience", but "disobedience of a lawful order." It is the whole compound expression that must be "wilful," and not the one word "disobedience" adding a provision "if the order be lawful." It is no doubt a correct principle that, once the relation of employer and employee is established, obedience to lawful orders is, if not expressly, then impliedly, contemplated by the contract creating the relation, and mere disobedience of such orders is a breach of the bargain. But whether disobedience in a given case is of such a character as to justify a complete dissolution of the contract by one of the parties and, as here, a forfeiture by the other of the valuable accruing rights, together with some degradation altogether a severe penalty is, in my opinion, quite a different matter. Such a justification requires the disobedience to be as phrased "wilful disobedience of a lawful order." That is, it must be not merely a breach but a radical breach of the relation, and inconsistent with its continuance. 

 
 Once the element of "wilfulness" is introduced for the purpose of the summary rescission by one party of the whole contractual relation, with penal results on the other, then, as the "wilfulness" is the attitude of the employee, so far as it is conveyed by words or acts to the employer, the subject must be looked at from a new standpoint. "Wilfully" does not necessarily connote in that connection anything criminal or immoral, but it does connote some deliberate design or purpose to derogate from duty.</text>

<tocase>Bruce v A W B Ltd (2000) 100 IR 129</tocase>
<text>In Bruce v A W B Ltd (2000) 100 IR 129 , an employee had been employed upon certain conditions, including that he report directly to the managing director and be a member of the executive committee. He was subsequently told that the organization was to be changed so that he would no longer be a member of the executive committee or report directly to the managing director. The employee asserted that the changes were in breach of his contract of employment, and that he was not willing to perform his duties on that basis. He remained willing to perform them in accordance with his understanding of the contract. He was dismissed upon the basis that he had repudiated his contract of employment. The contract provided that: "The duties of the above position are set out under establishment No 7100 or as directed by the Managing Director". The employer argued that the managing director was therefore empowered to dispense with the employee's "duties" of reporting to him and sitting on the executive committee, and to impose the duty of reporting to the general manager. Sundberg J concluded that the managing director was authorized to make the proposed changes. His Honour then had to consider the validity of the dismissal. At [15] his Honour said: 
 Two conditions must be satisfied at common law in order to justify a summary dismissal. First, there must be a breach by the employee of the terms of the contract or a demonstrated intention not to be bound by those terms. Secondly, the conduct must be sufficiently serious to allow summary termination. Freedland observes: 

 
"The right to rescind a contract for breach of condition arises by reason of a failure of performance which has occurred in the past, provided the failure is of sufficient gravity or relates to a sufficiently major term of the contract. The right to rescind a contract in response to repudiation arises, not so much by reason of a failure of performance in the past as by reason of the manifestation of an intention not to perform contractual obligations in the future."
 
 
 See The Contract of Employment (1976) at p 217.

The passage from Freedland which was cited in Bruce recognizes a distinction between breach and repudiation. In Bruce , as far as the report goes, there had been no actual failure by the employee to perform his duties in accordance with the proposed changes in arrangements, or any exercise of a purported right to do that which he was no longer required to do. Similarly, in Mona Homes , time not being of the essence of the contract, either the vendor had not yet breached the contract, or any breach did not provide a basis for determining it. In the present case, however, Mr Harrison not only indicated that he would not comply with the direction, but did not do so. This conduct continued from the time at which Mr Allard first raised the matter with him until he left the meeting on 2 May 2008. He has not demonstrated any basis for believing the direction to be unlawful. On his own version he wanted it reduced to writing for reasons that were extraneous to his employment. Whilst it is true that on 6 May 2008 Mr Bradley suggested that there was some question of discrimination or, perhaps, illegality about the direction, he also made no attempt to demonstrate any basis for that view. I see no basis upon which such a submission could be made. I do not accept that either man genuinely believed the direction to be unlawful. There is no basis for asserting that on 2 May 2008 Mr Harrison refused to comply with the direction because he considered it to be unlawful, or that he asserted a construction of his contract of employment which was inconsistent with that impliedly advanced by Mr Allard in giving the direction.</text>

<tocase>D.T.R. Nominees Proprietary Limited v Mona Homes Proprietary Limited and Another [1978] HCA 12 ; (1976-1977) 138 CLR 423</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/12.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicants also rely upon the decision of the High Court in D.T.R. Nominees Proprietary Limited v Mona Homes Proprietary Limited and Another [1978] HCA 12 ; (1976-1977) 138 CLR 423. That case concerned a contract for the sale of land, completion being conditional upon registration of a plan of subdivision, a copy of which was attached to the contract. At the date of the contract the vendor had not lodged the plan but had lodged a plan for a larger subdivision of which the subject land was part, seeking approval of so much of the subdivision as related to that land. That plan was approved and registered. The vendor then required completion within 14 days. The purchasers purported to rescind the contract on the basis that the plan attached to the contract had not been registered, and that the vendor had thereby repudiated the contract. The vendor asserted that the purchasers had wrongfully repudiated the contract and purported to rescind, forfeiting the deposit. The purchasers commenced proceedings seeking a declaration that the contract had been validly rescinded upon the basis that in lodging the plan of subdivision the vendor had repudiated the contract, or that subsequent correspondence, asserting compliance with the term as to registration and calling for completion, had constituted repudiation. In the High Court the first question was whether or not an intention to repudiate the contract could be inferred from the vendor's conduct. At 432 Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ said (Aickin J concurring): 
 No doubt there are cases in which a party, by insisting on an incorrect interpretation of a contract, evinces an intention that he will not perform the contract according to its terms. But there are other cases in which a party, though asserting a wrong view of a contract because he believes it to be correct, is willing to perform the contract according to its tenor. He may be willing to recognize his heresy once the true doctrine is enunciated or he may be willing to accept an authoritative exposition of the correct interpretation. In either event an intention to repudiate the contract could not be attributed to him. As Pearson LJ observed in Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd v Universal News Services Ltd: 

 
"In the last resort, if the parties cannot agree, the true construction will have to be determined by the court. A party should not too readily be found to have refused to perform the agreement by contentious observations in a course of discussions or arguments ... ."
 
 
 In this case the appellant acted on its view of the contract without realizing that the respondents were insisting upon a different view until such time as they purported to rescind. It was not a case in which any attempt was made to persuade the [vendor] of the error of its ways or indeed to give it any opportunity to reconsider its position in the light of an assertion of the correct interpretation. There is therefore no basis on which one can infer that the [vendor] was persisting in its interpretation willy nilly in the face of a clear enunciation of the true agreement.

The passage from Freedland which was cited in Bruce recognizes a distinction between breach and repudiation. In Bruce , as far as the report goes, there had been no actual failure by the employee to perform his duties in accordance with the proposed changes in arrangements, or any exercise of a purported right to do that which he was no longer required to do. Similarly, in Mona Homes , time not being of the essence of the contract, either the vendor had not yet breached the contract, or any breach did not provide a basis for determining it.

Whilst it is true that on 6 May 2008 Mr Bradley suggested that there was some question of discrimination or, perhaps, illegality about the direction, he also made no attempt to demonstrate any basis for that view. I see no basis upon which such a submission could be made. I do not accept that either man genuinely believed the direction to be unlawful. There is no basis for asserting that on 2 May 2008 Mr Harrison refused to comply with the direction because he considered it to be unlawful, or that he asserted a construction of his contract of employment which was inconsistent with that impliedly advanced by Mr Allard in giving the direction.</text>
