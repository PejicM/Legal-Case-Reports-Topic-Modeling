<tocase>Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630</tocase>
<text>28 The starting point for consideration of the appellant's arguments seem to me to be conveniently addressed in a decision of a Full Court in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46] to [47]. The Full Court there observed that:
 
 It is plainly not necessary for the tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons.

29 Their Honours pointed out that there is a distinction between the tribunal failing to advert to evidence which, if accepted, might lead to a different finding, and a failure by a tribunal to address a contention which, if accepted, might establish that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Their Honours observed at [47] that the "inference that the tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons". However, that is an inference which will not too readily be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point.

30 It is therefore important to note, as I have already pointed out, that the Tribunal expressly recorded the appellant's adviser's post hearing submissions which stated that the factors relied upon by the appellant may not of themselves amount to a claim for asylum but that cumulatively they created a profile of an imputed association with Falun Gong. It seems to me to follow from this and also from the lengthy statement of the appellant's claims in the Tribunal that the reasons given by the Tribunal must be read in light of those two factors; that is to say the issue which the appellant now seeks to agitate was expressly referred to by the Tribunal before it gave its findings and reasons, and the findings are therefore to be informed by that fact.

37 I reject the submission put by counsel for the appellant that the Tribunal failed to address a contention. I do not think the appellant's argument is supported by what was said in Applicant WAEE at [44]. The present case falls for consideration upon a fair reading of all of the reasons of the Tribunal. I have already given my views on that question.

38 In my view it follows that the orders to be made are that the appeal be dismissed with costs.
 
 
 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson J.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/33.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The grounds of review which the appellant seeks to raise in her amended notice of appeal do not appear on their face to be within the grounds that were raised before the Federal Magistrate. However, I think it is arguable that they fell within the unreasonableness ground and, in any event, counsel for the Minister disclaimed any prejudice to the Minister by the raising of these grounds on appeal. Accordingly, applying the principles stated by a Full Court in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] to [48], I would be prepared to grant leave to the appellant to raise the grounds on the appeal. That, of course, is not to say that amended grounds could be raised on appeal if the principles referred to by the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8 are infringed.</text>

<tocase>Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244</tocase>
<text>26 The principle is that there will be jurisdictional error if the Tribunal fails to make a finding on "a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying on established facts". This may amount to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. This principle was referred to by a Full Court in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [55] . The court also referred at [57] to the nature of the review function as described by Allsop J in Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42]; this is that the tribunal is to consider all of the component integers of the appellant's claim.</text>

<tocase>Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 263</tocase>
<text>31 The appellant relied upon the decision of Moore J in Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1401. That case was referred to with apparent approval by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 263 at [48]. Kaur was a case in which it was argued that the tribunal considered each of the facts put forward by the applicant in isolation but failed to consider their cumulative weight. His Honour accepted that this may amount to constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. His Honour cited a number of authorities in support of that proposition.

36 In my view the present case falls within the approach taken by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran at [49]. His Honour observed that the separate treatment of the incident relied on in that case did not indicate that the tribunal failed to look at the case in its entirety. His Honour remarked that the tribunal stated that it reached its conclusion "[h]aving considered the evidence as a whole" and that there was no reason to doubt the statement. In my view that is apt in the present case. Sundberg J agreed with the reasons given by Finkelstein J. The reasons of Emmett J at [23] are also consistent with this approach.</text>

<text>31 The appellant relied upon the decision of Moore J in Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1401. That case was referred to with apparent approval by Finkelstein J in Jegatheeswaran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 263 at [48].

His Honour accepted that this may amount to constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. His Honour cited a number of authorities in support of that proposition.

35 However, in the present case, for the three reasons that I have mentioned above, I consider that the Tribunal dealt with all of the integers of the claim and that the facts put forward to support the profile were considered cumulatively. Indeed, that was the view which was eventually reached by Moore J in Kaur at [13] to [15]. It seems to me that the reasons given by the tribunal in Kaur pointed more strongly in the direction of a compartmentalised consideration of the claims than appears in the present case.</text>
