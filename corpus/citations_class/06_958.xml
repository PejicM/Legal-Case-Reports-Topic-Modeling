<tocase>Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) (2003) 45 ACSR 446</tocase>
<text>11 The evidence establishes a case for the making of both orders and they should be made. An order extending the convening period, without more, would leave s 439A(2) requiring that the meeting be held within the period of five business days following the expiry of the extending convening period, and no earlier: cf Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) (2003) 45 ACSR 446 at [10] [14]. An order should be made, or sought, under s 447A permitting the meeting to be held during the extended convening period or within the said period of five business days thereafter.
