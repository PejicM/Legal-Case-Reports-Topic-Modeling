<text>1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZKEJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 838) dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent, the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal), not to grant the appellant a protection visa pursuant to s 36(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).

2 The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, arrived in Australia on 28 August 2004 and lodged an application for a protection visa on 5 October 2004. He claimed to fear persecution for political reasons because of his involvement with the Pakistan Muslim League of which he was the local Area President.

3 On 22 October 2004, a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, refused the application. The Tribunal affirmed that decision. An application to the Federal Magistrates Court resulted in orders by consent remitting the matter to the Tribunal. A differently constituted Tribunal heard further evidence from the appellant and again affirmed the decision to refuse a protection visa.

4 The essence of the Tribunal's decision was that, as a result of a number of inconsistencies between the evidence contained in his protection visa application, the evidence he supplied at the first Tribunal hearing and the evidence he supplied at the second Tribunal hearing, the appellant was not a credible witness. As a result, the Tribunal did not accept the appellant's claims to have suffered persecution in Pakistan, nor was it satisfied that he faced a real chance of persecution were he to return there. Accordingly, the Tribunal determined that the application did not satisfy the criterion for a protection visa.

5 The grounds of the application for review in the Federal Magistrates Court were as follows:
 
 
 "(1) The Tribunal relied on the previous RRT decision with much information without giving the applicant opportunity to comment upon the information given to the Tribunal before and during the interview which give rise to breach of s.424 of the Migration Act . 
 (2) Whilst the Tribunal has leeway as to how the provided information is interpreted, the decision involves jurisdictional error affecting the decision as the Tribunal has erroneously adopted the approach that generally documents obtained from Pakistan are fake. The Tribunal could have checked the authenticity of the documents from the issuing agencies through Australian overseas post. 
 (3) The Tribunal has erred in failing to make enquiry to the adequacy of the applicant's claim that he was arrested, detained and gaold (sic jailed) for considerable period of time. 
 (4) The Tribunal has erred in making findings that the documentary evidence provided is fake and fail to take into account matters within jurisdictional facts and erroneously failing to consider such facts." 
 
 
 

Turner FM considered and rejected each of those grounds and dismissed the application.</text>

<text>11 The Tribunal's decision not to accept the appellant's documents as a reliable corroboration of his claims was based in part on an inconsistency between those documents and his oral evidence. There is no evidence that the Tribunal alerted the appellant to this issue. Although not relied upon by the appellant, I raised that point with counsel for the respondent. I accept the submission that the Tribunal's reasoning cannot be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of s 424A(1)(a) ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18]). It was not obliged to notify the appellant in advance of its doubts arising from the inconsistencies.

12 The appeal is dismissed and the appellant is to pay the costs of the first respondent.

 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

<text>10 Section 425(1) of the Act, subject to the exceptions in subsection (2), requires the Tribunal to invite an applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. It is clear that the appellant was given such an invitation. Further, the appellant was given the opportunity to rebut the Tribunal's inference that the documents were not authentic.
