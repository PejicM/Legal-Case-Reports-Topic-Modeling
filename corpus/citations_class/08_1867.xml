<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>18 The appellants contend that the primary judge has mis-applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 and that the primary judge has relied upon the evidence of Mr Breed in reaching conclusions about the evidence of Mr Tracy and matters going to Mr Tracy's credit. Further, the appellants say that they have been denied procedural fairness as they were not provided with an opportunity to cross-examine Mr Breed in respect of his affidavit tendered in evidence by the respondents. These matters concerning Mr Breed are said to involve errors of law affecting fact-finding and give rise to arguable grounds of appeal. Mr Lynch gives emphasis to these matters particularly the contended denial of procedural fairness in the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Breed, in his oral submissions in support of the stay application. Mr Lynch says that the appeal is not frivolous and raises arguable grounds. He says that if the first and second respondents resist the stay of the orders on the cross-claim on the ground fundamentally that the appellants have failed to reach the threshold of an arguable ground of appeal, the challenge to the findings on credit and their relationship with the evidence of Mr Breed raises at least an arguable ground of appeal.

19 The notice of appeal recites 63 grounds of appeal. It is not useful in these reasons to recite all of the grounds of appeal nor is it useful to undertake an analysis of the merits of any of them. It is useful however to identify the focus of the grounds of challenge in exercising the discretion in relation to the stay of the orders on the cross-claim, in particular.

20 By grounds 1, 2, 7, 14, 17, 18, 21, 23, [23 again], 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 52, 54, 55, 58 and 60, the appellants contend that the primary judge reached findings which are against the weight of evidence. By grounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20, 25, 30 and 36, the appellants contend for errors of law in the reception into evidence of Mr Breed's affidavit, the denial of an opportunity to cross-examine Mr Breed (procedural unfairness), the refusal to draw an adverse inference against the first and second respondents in accordance with Jones v Dunkel and errors of law in reliance upon the affidavit in relation to particular findings. By ground 3, the appellants say that the adverse finding on credit based upon a failure to adduce evidence of a serious accusation is unreliable because the appellants did not plead such an allegation and were not obliged to adduce evidence of it. By ground 4, the appellants say that credit findings concerning Mr Tracy which rely upon allegations by him of the use by the first respondent of a particular pesticide are unreliable and made in error as the particular allegation was not pleaded against the first respondent.

21 By grounds 15 and 15A, the appellants say that the primary judge erred in law by finding that the first respondent when authorising the provision of a valuation dated 1 June 2004 to Mr Tracy, did not contravene s 52 of the Act on the basis that the valuation mentioned financial years not crop years.

22 By grounds 22 and 23, the appellants contend that the primary judge erred in law in concluding that the contended failure to disclose particular matters was misleading or deceptive.</text>

<text>26 The second criticism is this. The respondents say the appellants have not established that any loss or damage was suffered and thus the cause of action fails. The criticism is put on this basis. In the action, each applicant claimed loss particular to that applicant ([12] herein). Oddly, the appellants by Order 3 of the notice of appeal all seek judgment against the first and second respondents for the aggregate damage of $3,208,705.20. That seems to be an inconsistent position. The respondents say that there was no dispute on the evidence that the first appellant completed the orchard purchase contract ( i.e. the Tiaro and Bundaberg Orchards), paid $3.1 million on settlement and borrowed $150,000.00 from the vendor (as part vendor finance) to complete settlement. The contract was signed by Mr Tracy on 16 January 2005 and completed by Citrus Queensland on 21 March 2005. The appellants as applicants at trial sought to establish, it is said, the "current value" of the orchards rather than the value at the date of contract or perhaps settlement. Thus, the appellants failed to strike the difference between the reliance price paid under the contract and the Kizbeau "real" or "true" or "intrinsic" value of the orchards at acquisition ( Kizbeau Pty Ltd v W G &amp; B Pty Limited [1995] HCA 4 ; (1995) 184 CLR 281 ; Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1 ; HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640) taking account of all known matters relevant to that comparison at the date the assessment was carried out ( HTW Valuers [39]-[41], Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ).</text>

<text>28 The third appellant also claimed trading losses as damages. The respondents say that there are two fatal problems with that claim. First, the evidence did not establish that the claimed trading losses were suffered as a direct consequence of contravening conduct in the sense contemplated by Sheppard, Wilcox and Pincus JJ in Netaf Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Bikane Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 35 ; (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494 and secondly, the third appellant was in any event insolvent from incorporation and its guiding mind, Mr Tracy, had little experience in the industry on the evidence and findings at trial.

29 The appellants say that these observations about damages and evidence going to true value or otherwise at a relevant date were ultimately not the subject of thorough analysis by her Honour as her Honour elected not to deal with damages having made findings on other matters with the result that the application was to be dismissed.</text>

<tocase>Bell Wholesale Co. Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>34 Section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 confers a broad discretion on the Court to make an order for security for costs ( Bell Wholesale Co. Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 per Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ; Cameron's Unit Services Pty Ltd v Kevin R Whelpton &amp; Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd (1986) 13 FCR 46 per Burchett J; Bryan E Fencott &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 497 per French J at 515) including an order for security in an appeal. The appellants concede that an order for security ought properly be made requiring the appellants to provide security. The appellants further concede that there is a jurisdiction to order security for costs prospectively and also power to order security for costs already incurred such as costs associated with the making of the application for security for costs. Having said that, the appellants contend that any order for security ought, in this case, to operate only prospectively. The first and third appellants are not in a position to be able to pay the first and second respondents' costs of the appeal if they are unsuccessful on appeal. On 9 August 2005, Sunstate Citrus (the third appellant) entered into a Deed of Company Arrangement. Recital A of the Deed records that on 23 June 2005, Mr Tracy [the director] resolved to the effect that in his opinion the company was insolvent or likely to become insolvent at some time in the future and that Mr Hambleton be appointed as administrator under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Moreover, on 8 November 2006, Mr Tracy swore an affidavit in the respondents' application for security for costs in relation to the principal proceeding in which he said that neither the first nor third applicants [appellants] "has sufficient funds to provide that security either by 4pm tomorrow or at all". In the course of evidence during the trial, Mr Tracy conceded that the first applicant [appellant] did not have sufficient assets to meet any judgment ordered against it. Mr Tracy also conceded that as to the third applicant "it too has no assets". At trial, Mr Hambleton gave evidence that in his view there was "a strong prospect" that the third appellant had been "insolvent from incorporation". Plainly enough, there is no prospect of the third appellant paying any orders for costs against it and there seems little likelihood of any satisfaction from the first appellant. The respondents inevitably look to the individual, Mr Tracy, the second appellant for their costs should they be successful in the appeal. The second appellant is already subject to a substantial order for costs and neither the first nor the second appellant will be able to discharge those orders. Mr Tracy has not filed an affidavit in the proceeding by which he seeks to establish his capacity to satisfy existing costs orders or costs to be incurred except to say this. The appellants contend that $50,000.00 should be provided by way of security. Presumably, the appellants are in a position to provide that amount and will do so quickly in order to enable the appeal to proceed. The real question is what is the appropriate amount to properly secure the interests of the respondents?</text>

I am satisfied that the application for security was made promptly and was reasonable in all the circumstances. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to provide security for the costs of the motion. Such an application is not uncommon and if promptly made an applicant for security is reasonably entitled to the costs incurred in making the application. A respondent to an appeal confronting at least two parties with no capacity to meet the costs a respondent will incur, will quite understandably seek to protect its position by making an application for security. The quantum of the security to be provided is ultimately a matter for the exercise of discretion ( Bruce Pie &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Mainwaring (1985) 1 Qd R 401 per McPherson J; Procon (GB) Ltd v Provincial Building Co.

<tocase>Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation (1996) 137 ALR 498</tocase>
<text>39 The principles influencing the exercise of the discretion are these. Order 52, r 17(1) suggests by its language a broad discretion, unlimited, in the Court to order a stay notwithstanding that an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed from ( Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation (1996) 137 ALR 498 , Burchett J). The starting point however, is to recognise that the discretion, although importantly broad, is a true exception , conditioned by demonstrated circumstances, to the general proposition that an appeal does not operate as a stay. That is because the judgment appealed from is prima facie assumed to be correct and a person put to trial in a controversy rather than enjoying the benefit of performance or settlement is entitled to enforce the orders which when made reflect the position inter-parties according to law. However, consistent with Powerflex and Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp. Ltd (receivers apptd) [1985] 2 NSWLR 685 per Kirby P, Hope and McHugh JJ at 694, it is sufficient but also necessary that the applicant for a stay demonstrate "a reason" or an "appropriate case" to warrant the exercise of discretion in the applicant's favour. Otherwise, judgments of the Court in its original jurisdiction might be treated as merely provisional. A reason tipping the balance in favour of an applicant in an appropriate case will take account of whether the applicant has discharged an onus of demonstrating that a stay order, in the terms proposed, is "fair to all parties" ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 694F) having regard to the balance of convenience ( i.e. the balance of risks and irremediable harm) and the competing rights of the parties ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 694G). For example, is there a risk that should a stay be ordered, the appellants will dissipate or transfer assets that might otherwise have answered the judgment? Should a stay be conditioned on the payment of money into Court, a payment of some monies to the judgment creditor or the provision of security for the judgment debt?

40 "Fairness" will be, in part assessed, by an applicant demonstrating that the benefit of a successful appeal will be taken away in every practical sense or rendered nugatory, if no stay of the primary order(s) is granted. Such a consideration has been described as a "substantial factor" influencing the discretion to order a stay ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695D). Weighed in the balance is a preliminary non-speculative assessment of whether the appellant by the grounds of appeal has raised an arguable case. Such an assessment however is designed to be "protective" of the judgment creditor in the sense of being undertaken to test whether the appeal has "been lodged without any real prospect of success and simply in the hope of granting a respite against immediate execution upon the judgment" ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695F).

<text>39 The principles influencing the exercise of the discretion are these. Order 52, r 17(1) suggests by its language a broad discretion, unlimited, in the Court to order a stay notwithstanding that an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed from ( Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation (1996) 137 ALR 498 , Burchett J). The starting point however, is to recognise that the discretion, although importantly broad, is a true exception , conditioned by demonstrated circumstances, to the general proposition that an appeal does not operate as a stay. That is because the judgment appealed from is prima facie assumed to be correct and a person put to trial in a controversy rather than enjoying the benefit of performance or settlement is entitled to enforce the orders which when made reflect the position inter-parties according to law. However, consistent with Powerflex and Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp. Ltd (receivers apptd) [1985] 2 NSWLR 685 per Kirby P, Hope and McHugh JJ at 694, it is sufficient but also necessary that the applicant for a stay demonstrate "a reason" or an "appropriate case" to warrant the exercise of discretion in the applicant's favour. Otherwise, judgments of the Court in its original jurisdiction might be treated as merely provisional. A reason tipping the balance in favour of an applicant in an appropriate case will take account of whether the applicant has discharged an onus of demonstrating that a stay order, in the terms proposed, is "fair to all parties" ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 694F) having regard to the balance of convenience ( i.e. the balance of risks and irremediable harm) and the competing rights of the parties ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 694G). For example, is there a risk that should a stay be ordered, the appellants will dissipate or transfer assets that might otherwise have answered the judgment? Should a stay be conditioned on the payment of money into Court, a payment of some monies to the judgment creditor or the provision of security for the judgment debt?

40 "Fairness" will be, in part assessed, by an applicant demonstrating that the benefit of a successful appeal will be taken away in every practical sense or rendered nugatory, if no stay of the primary order(s) is granted. Such a consideration has been described as a "substantial factor" influencing the discretion to order a stay ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695D). Weighed in the balance is a preliminary non-speculative assessment of whether the appellant by the grounds of appeal has raised an arguable case. Such an assessment however is designed to be "protective" of the judgment creditor in the sense of being undertaken to test whether the appeal has "been lodged without any real prospect of success and simply in the hope of granting a respite against immediate execution upon the judgment" ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695F). These principles have been applied in Powerflex v Data Access Corporation ; Starborne Holdings Pty Ltd v Radferry Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [1998] FCA 548 ; Henderson v Amadio Pty Ltd (No. 3 ) (1996) 65 FCR 66 and other cases in this Court.

<text>41 In exercising the discretion to grant a stay or fashion the particular terms of intervention, the Court would ordinarily only impede the enforcement of its orders pending appeal so far as is necessary to ensure that orders which might ultimately be made by the Court on appeal can be given effect without leaving residual injustice in the hands of the party ultimately successful, as a residue of the first instance orders being performed, absent a stay. That is why the Court gives particular attention to whether an appeal might be rendered nugatory by the refusal of a stay and whether an appellant would be irremediably prejudiced if the stay were not granted yet its appeal ultimately upheld ( Cook's Construction Proprietary Limited v Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] QCA 322). The risk that an appeal may be nugatory must be balanced against the risk of prejudice to the party who succeeded at first instance if execution of the judgment is stayed ( Sevenhill Holdings Pty Ltd v Musovic per French J). On the question of a nugatory appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal (Keane JA; McMurdo P and White AJA agreeing) in Cook's Construction v Stork Food Systems considered that even if the refusal of a stay were, in the circumstances of that case, to lead to the receivership or liquidation of the appellant, substantive rights could nevertheless be pursued by the receiver or the liquidator.</text>

41 In exercising the discretion to grant a stay or fashion the particular terms of intervention, the Court would ordinarily only impede the enforcement of its orders pending appeal so far as is necessary to ensure that orders which might ultimately be made by the Court on appeal can be given effect without leaving residual injustice in the hands of the party ultimately successful, as a residue of the first instance orders being performed, absent a stay. That is why the Court gives particular attention to whether an appeal might be rendered nugatory by the refusal of a stay and whether an appellant would be irremediably prejudiced if the stay were not granted yet its appeal ultimately upheld ( Cook's Construction Proprietary Limited v Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] QCA 322). The risk that an appeal may be nugatory must be balanced against the risk of prejudice to the party who succeeded at first instance if execution of the judgment is stayed ( Sevenhill Holdings Pty Ltd v Musovic per French J). On the question of a nugatory appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal (Keane JA; McMurdo P and White AJA agreeing) in Cook's Construction v Stork Food Systems considered that even if the refusal of a stay were, in the circumstances of that case, to lead to the receivership or liquidation of the appellant, substantive rights could nevertheless be pursued by the receiver or the liquidator.

44 Although the respondents contend that four grounds of criticism of the appeal ([24]-[32]) demonstrate that the appeal can not succeed and no arguable ground of appeal has been articulated, the grounds of appeal do not fall into the class of case described in Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation or Sevenhill Holdings v Musovic , notwithstanding the difficulties the appellants confront. In other words, the appellants have raised contentions that are other than frivolous. It is true that many of the grounds of appeal challenge findings of fact as against the weight of evidence. Similarly, the grounds of appeal call into question the findings of the primary judge on questions of credit in circumstances where the primary judge had the benefit of assessing the evidence of Mr Tracy and Mr Strahley in the context of all the evidence. Nevertheless, the appellants are entitled to seek to persuade the Court on appeal, that the various challenged findings ought not to have been made or that errors of law were made in the treatment of particular topics such as reliance or any of the other matters framed by the notice of appeal. In so observing, of course, I make no comment about the merits or otherwise of any particular matter raised by any of the grounds of appeal.

45 However, the first appellant has no capacity to pay the judgment debt or costs. No protective mechanism has been put forward by Mr Tracy or the first appellant to ensure that any stay order is "fair to all parties". Mr Tracy has not offered any undertaking on behalf of the first appellant not to charge or encumber any of its assets pending appeal and no security is offered over any assets of Mr Tracy. There is no proposal to pay the judgment sum or any part of it into Court. The absence of any such proposal is no doubt due to the incapacity of the first appellant to be able to do so and a disinclination in Mr Tracy to suggest any other mechanism for a supervised investment account.

46 The appellants' principal discretionary consideration urged upon the Court is that a refusal of a stay with any consequential payment of monies (particularly the deposit monies) to the first respondent would occur in circumstances where the first appellant has no reasonable confidence of repayment if ultimately successful. The appellants however have not demonstrated that residual injustice will arise by complying with the orders at first instance should the appeal be successful. In that sense, the appellant has not demonstrated that the appeal will be rendered nugatory by a refusal of a stay. Inconvenience in satisfying the judgment debt or, alternatively, the prospect of changes in the administration of the first appellant either by reason of receivership or liquidation does not of itself render an appeal nugatory.</text>
