<tocase>Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/94.html</AustLII>
<text>7 Until O 35A was introduced into the FCR in 2004, it was not open to the Court to make an order for a default judgment, except on a motion supported by evidence as to the merits of the application: Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94 , at [17], per Jacobson J and cases cited there. However, O 35A r 3(2)(c) permits the Court to grant relief if:
 
&#8226; a respondent is in default;
 
&#8226; the applicant appears entitled to the relief 'on the statement of claim'; and
 
&#8226; the Court is satisfied that it has power to grant the relief.</text>

<tocase>Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/36.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Order 35A has been interpreted as dispensing with the invariable requirement that the applicant prove by evidence that the pleaded claim is well-founded. In Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 , Kenny J (at [57]) said this:
 
 'Under the former O 10 r 7, an applicant was required to file proof by way of evidence of his or her claims when seeking judgment ... Under the new O 35A r 3, it now seems that reliance may be placed on the allegations in the relevant statement of claim. Judges of the Court have held that the rule does not require proof by way of evidence of the applicant's claim, but that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for the relief sought and that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 , at [3], per Heerey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1 CellNet LLC [2005] FCA 856 , at [14], per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert [2005] FCA 1311 , at [6]-[7], per Jackson J and Deisel Spa v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 , at [2], per Tamberlin J.'</text>

9 In the present case, as I have noted, the relief sought by the applicants includes restraining orders against the respondent. Order 35A r 3 has been applied where an applicant seeks relief of this kind (as distinct, for example, from damages), in consequence of default by a respondent: Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433.

10 For myself, I am inclined to think that some caution should be exercised before granting default relief of the kind sought in this case simply on the basis of the pleadings. In particular, the sanctions that can be invoked where a respondent contravenes a restraining order should be borne in mind. Order 35A r 3 vests a discretion in the Court. Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for the Court to require some evidence, for example, that the respondent has infringed an applicant's copyright as alleged in the statement of claim before making restraining orders or orders requiring a respondent to deliver up on oath infringing copies of copyright material (as the applicants seek here).

11 In the present case, Mr Cobden SC, who appeared with Ms Richardson for the applicants, read a number of affidavits in support of the motion. These satisfy me that the respondent has infringed the copyright of the various applicants in the identified films by selling or offering for sale DVDs that constitute copies of the films. The evidence also satisfies me that, unless restrained, the respondent is likely to continue his infringing activities. The evidence also supports the other relief sought by the applicants. There is therefore no need to consider whether it would have been appropriate, in the absence of such evidence, to grant the restraining orders sought by the applicants on the basis of the pleadings alone.</text>

<tocase>Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v Associated Radio Co of Australia Ltd [1925] VLR 350</tocase>
<text>12 The restraining orders the applicants seek have been carefully drawn and follow the form approved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v Associated Radio Co of Australia Ltd [1925] VLR 350, at 362-363. Indeed, the orders proposed in the present case are somewhat narrower than those made in Chappell v Associated Radio .

13 In summary, I am satisfied that:
 
&#8226; the respondent is in default for the purposes of O 35A r 3(2);
 
&#8226; each of the applicants appears entitled to relief in the form of restraining orders on the statement of claim;
 
&#8226; the Court has power to grant the relief sought; and
 
&#8226; it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion so as to make the orders sought.

14 Accordingly, I propose to make the orders sought by the applicants in the motion. These include restraining orders, an order for delivery up on oath of the infringing copies of the applicants' films and an inquiry as to damages.
 

 I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville.
