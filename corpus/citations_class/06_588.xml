<text>8 It is unnecessary to set out again the factual and procedural history which is set out in the reasons for judgment published on 1 May 2006 Applicant S1140/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 526. These reasons, should be read together with those, for that purpose.

9 The husband, in the presence of his wife, and with her authority confirmed orally in Court, made submissions on behalf of both of them in support of their applications for leave to appeal against the learned magistrate's decisions. However, nothing that was said in support of those applications identified any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrates Court which would warrant the grant of such leave. As previously observed, the proposed draft notice of appeal does not disclose any viable grounds for a proposed appeal. There was reference to other cases in which it was said applicants had been allowed to proceed in the Federal Magistrates Court but there was no principle proposed, emerging from those cases, which suggested they would be of any assistance in this case.

10 A matter which was drawn to my attention by counsel for the respondent, and which was not dealt with in the previously published reasons, was that the wife's application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court had been amended on or about 4 May 2005. A copy of the amended application appears in the Appeal Book relating to the wife. I assume that an amended application in like terms was filed in the husband's name. The amended application for judicial review of the Tribunal's 1998 decision asserts in substance that the Tribunal misconstrued the concept of persecution and ignored an important integer of the applicants' claim. It makes reference to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which was not in force at the time of the Tribunal's decision.

11 The grounds of the amended application do not assist the applicants. Indeed they strengthen the proposition that the proceedings in this case were an abuse of process because they canvass matters which clearly were, or could have been, raised before Mathews J in 1998.

12 I am satisfied that there is no merit in the proposed appeal and that the Magistrate correctly found that the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court amounted to an abuse of process. The applications for leave to appeal will be dismissed. 
 

 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
