<tocase>WABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 30 ; (2003) 134 FCR 271</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/30.html</AustLII>
<text>13 When the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the second decision he again asserted that the decision was based upon Mrs Sun's evidence and that he had not been allowed to cross-examine her. It is true that the matter was raised in a rather unorthodox way, but nonetheless it was raised. Concerning this complaint the Federal Magistrate said at [27] and [28]:
 
 
 27 At particular (f) to ground one and at ground five the [appellant] complains that the Tribunal did not allow him to cross-examine Ms Sun. The drafter of this document plainly understood that the Tribunal is not a court of law (see ground five) and that the Tribunal did not have an obligation to allow him to cross-examine Ms Sun. As Ms Wong submits, the [appellant] does not have such an entitlement to cross-examine persons appearing before the Tribunal to give evidence. Section 427(6)(b) of the Act plainly provides that the applicant has no such entitlement (see Algama v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) ..., cited with approval in WABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ... .
 
 28. The Tribunal's analysis reveals that it considered the evidence provided by Ms Sun, discussed her evidence at the hearing with the [appellant] and put to the [appellant] that it was "difficult to accept" the [appellant's] evidence in light of Ms Sun's evidence, and gave him the opportunity, by way of its s 424A letter, to further comment. That the Tribunal chose to give greater weight to the evidence of Ms Sun, as opposed to the evidence of the [appellant], is within the Tribunal's discharge of its duty as the finder of fact. I cannot see that the [appellant's] complaint that the Tribunal's preference for the evidence of Ms Sun to his evidence was made without "any substantial and objective evidence to support". On what was before it, it was open to the Tribunal to reject the [appellant's] evidence and to prefer that to prefer that of Ms Sun. The Tribunal gave clear reasons for this. This aspect of the complaint also does not succeed.

14 Ground 5 in the notice of appeal to this Court, is:
 The Federal Magistrate erred in law because the Tribunal's decision has obviously included apprehension of bias. Significantly, regarding my requirements to cross-examine Mrs Sun, I may understand that the Tribunal may not be a court of law, and thus the Tribunal may not have to do so. But, the key issue is that the Tribunal has given particular weight to Mrs Sun's allegation against me without any substantial and objective evidences! [sic]. In other words, the Tribunal preferred the evidence of Mrs Sun to my evidence and rejected my claims without any substantial and objective evidences to support! [sic].

15 Again, the language may be inelegant and the attribution of bias to the Tribunal may be misconceived. Nonetheless, the claim is sufficient to raise an assertion of lack of procedural fairness and should be understood as such. In any event, the notice of appeal was amended on 10 April 2008, pursuant to order made on 7 April 2008, to include a further ground of appeal as follows:
 The learned Federal Magistrate erred in upholding the Tribunal's error in treating s 427(6) of the Migration Act 1958 ("the Act ") as being determinative of the Appellant's application to cross-examine Mrs Sun and as a consequence: 
 
 &#8226; failing to consider the merits of the Appellant's application to cross-examine Ms Sun; 
 &#8226; failing to permit the Appellant to cross-examine Mrs Sun 
 
 (the "Alleged Errors").
 
 
The learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that the Alleged Errors amounted to a failure by the Tribunal to accord the Appellant procedural fairness. The learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that the failure by the Tribunal to accord the Appellant procedural fairness precluded the Tribunal's decision from being a "... decision under this Act ..." within the meaning of s 474 of the Act .

25 Of some significance in construing s 427(6) is the decision of the Full Court in WABZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 30 ; (2003) 134 FCR 271. That case concerned the entitlement to legal representation and the discretion to permit such representation. At [67]-[69] French and Lee JJ held that:
 
 
 67. The effect of the cases referred to is that s 427(6)(a) applies to applicants for review who appear before the Tribunal to give evidence. An applicant so appearing is "not entitled ... to be represented before the Tribunal by any other person". But that is a statement about entitlements. It does not exclude the rules of procedural fairness insofar as they may require representation in the circumstances of a particular case. ... To displace the common law agency rule is not to displace procedural fairness, although it could no doubt place a considerable obstacle in the way of any suggestion that procedural fairness requires in every case that an applicant be represented by a lawyer or other agent. ... 
 
 68. ... 
 
 69. The Tribunal clearly has a discretion to allow a person to be represented before it. The question that arises is whether there may be circumstances in which a decision to disallow representation of an applicant before the Tribunal amounts to a denial of procedural fairness.

26 Their Honours went on to conclude that in the circumstances of that case the Tribunal's refusal to permit legal representation constituted a denial of procedural fairness. Hill J reached the same conclusion. It may reasonably be inferred from that decision that had the law remained unchanged, there was, in the present case, a discretion to permit cross-examination. Further, a decision not to permit cross-examination might, in certain circumstances, have amounted to a failure to accord procedural fairness to the relevant applicant. There is a further question which was not addressed in WABZ . It is whether an applicant who, pursuant to s 425 , is invited to appear to give evidence and present arguments is a person invited to give evidence for the purposes of s 427(6). Given the strict limitations upon the content of the rules of procedural fairness imposed by the enactment of s 422B , there may well be justification for a strict reading of s 427(6) so as to exclude from its operation applicants who appear both to give evidence and make submissions. Such enactment occurred after the decision in WABZ .

30 The decision in Lat is consistent with the more recent decision of the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 at [48] . It follows that to the extent that WABZ established that a failure to permit cross-examination may constitute a denial of procedural fairness amounting to jurisdictional error, it is no longer good law. However, to the extent that the case establishes that the Tribunal has a discretion to permit cross-examination, I see no reason to doubt its correctness. It also follows that neither a person attending to give evidence, nor an applicant attending to make submissions, has a right to cross-examine witnesses.</text>

<text>27 The terms of s 422B in its original form are somewhat unclear. However their meaning was settled by the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat [2006] FCA 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214. In that case the Court adopted the reasoning of Heerey J in the earlier decision of VXDC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562. In the latter case at [23]-[25], Heerey J examined the history of events leading up to the enactment of s 422B. In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 , the High Court considered provisions in another part of the Act which were analogous to provisions concerning the procedure to be followed by the Tribunal. The majority held that such provisions did not exclude the common law rules of natural justice. McHugh J considered that the provisions did not "exhaustively define the content of fair procedure". Kirby J observed that "(i)t would require much clearer words" in order to provide that such provisions "exhaust the applicable rules of natural justice, although not mentioned and however important such requirements might be in the particular case".

29 In Lat the Full Court was concerned with s 51A , a provision similar in effect to s 422B. At [63]-[67] the Court said:
 
 
 63. We do not propose to repeat or analyse the division of opinion as to the ambit of the provisions which is revealed in those authorities. The differing views are fully set forth in the passages from the judgments to which we have referred.
 
 64. It is true that the words "in relation to the matters it deals with" might be thought to be ambiguous or, perhaps, as Heerey J said in VXDC , obscure. However, reference to the Explanatory Memorandum and the Second Reading Speech makes it plain that s 51A and the related provisions of the Act , were intended to overcome the effect of the High Court's decision in ... Miah ... .
 
 65. Heerey J set out in VXDC at [23]-[25] the relevant passages from the majority judgments in Miah and the salient portions of the Explanatory Memorandum and the Second Reading Speech. The words "exhaustively state" are, as Heerey J pointed out, picked up in the Explanatory Statement from the majority judgments in Miah . We agree with the observation at [30] in VXDC that the drafters of the Explanatory Statement and the Minister could hardly have made the intention of the 2002 amendments any clearer. 
 
 66. What was intended was that Subdiv AB provide comprehensive procedural codes which contain detailed provisions for procedural fairness but which exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule.
 
 67. Other aspects of the common law of natural justice, such as the bias rule are not excluded ... .

28 In VXDC Heerey J considered that the insertion of s 422B was intended to reverse the effect of the decision in Miah . His Honour referred to the relevant explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech and, at [30]-[31] concluded:
 
 
 30. In the present case it is not easy to see how the drafters of the explanatory statement and the Minister could have made it any plainer that the intent of the 2002 amendments was to reverse the result of Miah and provide comprehensive procedural codes which made detailed provision for procedural fairness but excluded the common law natural justice hearing rule. Astute readers will notice the term "exhaust" is picked up from the majority judgments and included in the Statement and Speech, as well as in the amendments themselves. 
 
 31. Moreover, essentially the same procedural codes are introduced for a wide range of administrative decision-making functions under the Migration Act , in many cases no doubt made by officers who are not legally qualified. Parliament cannot have intended that the uncertainties of the common law rules were, in some unspecified way and to some unspecified extent, to survive.

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>35 I should refer to the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. In the course of considering the present appeal I became concerned by the fact that the decision made no reference to s 422B , although the Tribunal hearing had apparently taken place after the commencement of that section. I wrongly assumed that as s 422B is a procedural section, it would have applied to all hearings taking place after its commencement. However Mr Knackstredt has pointed out to me that the amending legislation expressly provided that it apply only in connection with applications made on, or after, its commencement.

36 The outcome of this case is by no means satisfactory in the administration of justice. Experience suggests that it is only on rare occasions that applicants will seek to cross-examine witnesses in the Tribunal. It may be said that if it is allowed in one case, it will become more common. There may be a degree of truth in that. However it is impossible to overlook the frustration and dissatisfaction which must be caused to an applicant for a protection visa where his or her claim is significantly undermined by evidence from a witness whom he or she may not even know, and whose evidence is not to be tested in any objective way. The right to face and challenge one's accuser or opponent is a fundamental aspect of the public trial process, on both the civil and the criminal sides. Although the Tribunal process may not be adversarial, the matters which it decides are of great importance for the parties, particularly for applicants. The Tribunal cannot, and should not, assume its own omniscience. It may know little or nothing about the motivation of a witness who gives damning evidence about a protection visa applicant. Experience suggests that one way of testing such evidence is to allow cross-examination. I do not suggest that Mrs Sun should have been treated as being in any way a suspect witness. However one can understand why the appellant was not satisfied by the way in which the Tribunal decided to act to his detriment in reliance on her evidence.

37 Whilst one would not like to encourage lengthy and unnecessary cross-examination in connection with visa applications and review proceedings, each case must be approached on its merits. I am inclined to think that in this case the merits lay in the direction of allowing a limited degree of cross-examination. It is a great pity that the appellant has been deprived of that opportunity. However, given the limited availability of judicial review, I can see no basis for intervening.

38 In the circumstances the appeal must be dismissed. I once again thank counsel for their enthusiastic assistance in this matter. I will hear submissions as to costs.

 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.
