<tocase>Tait v Harris [2003] FCA 446</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/446.html</AustLII>
<text>The first respondent, a Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia, has agreed to abide by any order of the Court save as to costs. As I understand Mr Rana's application against the Registrar it is without foundation once its essence is appreciated. The Official Trustee having filed a notice of discontinuance in an application in the High Court in A20 of 2008 for an order to show cause against a judge of this Court, the Registrar has taken no further steps in that matter. Unless and until the Official Trustee's decision to file that notice is declared invalid, the Registrar was entitled to act upon it. In any event, any decisions taken by the Registrar in relation to the acceptance or otherwise of material for filing in the High Court, even where potentially amenable to review under the AD(JR) Act; see Tait v Harris [2003] FCA 446 ; are not ones in relation to which I should make any determination. Such matters, which involve the conduct of the High Court's own officers in the discharge of their duties, are, in my view, ones for that Court itself properly to determine.

The real respondent in this matter is the Official Trustee and Mr Rana's complaints are in relation to decisions allegedly taken by the Trustee in relation to proceedings which Mr Rana has prosecuted and lost in this Court (whether at first instance or on appeal).

Because the application relates to decisions taken by the Trustee in that capacity, the application has been dealt with as well as if it were made under s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). The section provides: 
 
 178(1) If the bankrupt, a creditor or any other person is affected by an act, omission or decision of the trustee, he or she may apply to the Court, and the Court may make such order in the matter as it thinks just and equitable. 
 

 
 
 178(2) The application must be made not later than 60 days after the day on which the person became aware of the trustee's act, omission or decision. 
 

 
I simply note that the application initiating this proceeding appears to have been filed within the time limited by s 178(2) in respect of what I consider to be operative decisions of the Trustee in this matter.</text>

<tocase>Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1988) 12 NSWLR 45</tocase>
<text>These provisions have been subjected to considerable judicial exegesis. It suffices for present purposes if I refer without further comment to observations of Kirby P in Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1988) 12 NSWLR 45 at 50: 
 
 These provisions make it clear that the scheme and purpose of the Act is, upon the debtor's becoming a bankrupt, to transfer property rights, including certainly the right to sue in respect of claims to property, from the bankrupt to his trustee. This is so, notwithstanding that it involves personal inconvenience to the bankrupt: see Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 5 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119. Indeed, it is so notwithstanding the fact that it deprives the bankrupt of important civil rights which he or she would otherwise normally enjoy. It is of the essence of bankruptcy, as provided for by the Act, that property which belongs to the bankrupt, including choses in action (other than those which are specifically exempted) are vested upon bankruptcy in the bankrupt's trustee.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/592.html</AustLII>
<text>This was an appeal by Mr Rana from the decision of the Federal Magistrate who made the sequestration order against him. The Trustee wrote to the court on 29 August 2008 notifying its decision to elect to discontinue the appeal. Nonetheless, the matter properly was heard: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 592 at [11] ; and the appeal was dismissed on 20 October 2008. An application was made to the High Court for special leave. As will be seen below that application has been dismissed.

There is no decision of the Trustee in relation to the appeal to the Federal Court that could now found proceedings under the AD(JR) Act or s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act. (iv) A 32 of 2008

This was the application for special leave to appeal against the decision in SAD 124 of 2008. It was dismissed on 29 April 2009. The Official Trustee does not appear, on the evidence before me, to have made any decision after the decision in SAD 124 of 2008 which could now be the subject of review in this matter.

<text>In the decision refusing the application for an extension of time in which to appeal against the above orders, Lander J indicated that judgment had been entered against Mr Rana under s 31A , not because of some failure in the pleading to identify a cause of action: 
 
 Judgment was entered against him [on 17 March] because, manifestly, in the manner in which the proceeding was presented, he had no claim against any of those four respondents. He could not have, in my opinion, amended his statement of claim so as to cure those defects: Rana v University of Adelaide [2008] FCA 940 at [14] .

<tocase>Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/77.html</AustLII>
<text>I would interpolate that, having regard to the complaints made by Mr Rana against the various respondents, the proceeding before Lander J was, manifestly, an abuse of process: it was "foredoomed to fail": Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393.

The preliminary point to be noted about A 20 of 2008 is that the action was commenced after Mr Rana's bankruptcy. Importantly it thus falls outside of the provisions of s 60(2) and (4) of the Bankruptcy Act . This requires emphasis. In Daemar a proceedings by way of summons claiming orders in the nature of prerogative relief (together with damages and declaratory relief) was held by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales to be an "action" for the purposes of s 60(2) of the Bankruptcy Act . It was, in the circumstances, further held to be an action in which the plaintiff sought relief affecting his property. It was not one in respect of any personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, Mr Daemar, for the purposes of the s 60(4) exemption from the s 60(2) stay.

Mr Rana's obvious motivation in instituting the show cause action was as a step along the way to establishing and vindicating the right he alleges he has to recover damages for a personal injury or wrong to him. This is clear on the face of the application which joined all of the respondents in the proceeding before Lander J. Moreover the grounds on which relief was sought were directed at those respondents. It is not for me in this proceeding to consider whether he had standing to institute the action. That is a matter for the High Court. My present concern, rather, is with whether it can properly be said he is able to seek succour in s 116(2)(g) and hence challenge the trustee's discontinuance of the proceeding. I do not consider that he can do so.

I can state my reasons shortly. First, though the various causes of action are widely cast in the Statement of Claim, at their centre are claims for breaches of contracts against some of the respondents and breaches of confidence, with satellite claims for negligence, defamation (to which I will refer separately below) and contraventions of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act against one or other of them. The contracts in question were a series of settlement agreements with several of the respondents in respect of outstanding litigations against them. The damages said to flow from all of these various wrongs, as best one can understand it, appears to be constituted primarily by a claim for $4,000,000 for "the loss and damage occurring to the applicant's compensation and benefits claims against the Commonwealth ... and its various agencies". It is to say the least difficult to see how such damages could be said to result from the wrong alleged. They clearly are not relevantly damages for a "personal injury or wrong done to [him]": cf s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g).

Distinctly, I am not satisfied that Mr Rana is seeking to vindicate or establish a "personal wrong or injury" for s 116(2)(g) purposes. All of the claims he advanced (in SAD 12 of 2008) against all five respondents were struck out as abuses of process. No legally intelligible claims were disclosed against four of the respondents; the remaining claim against the University of South Australia was also struck out for the same reason, his Honour having found it was based on a document relied upon by Mr Rana which was "not authentic": Rana v University of Adelaide (No 2) at [7]. The proceedings before Lander J were doomed to failure. The imagined claims made did not give that degree of authenticity to the rights asserted such as would justify characterising them as rights to recover damages for personal injury or wrong to the bankrupt for s 116(2)(g) purposes. They are illusory rights.

The final comment I should make is this. If I was not satisfied that, for whatever reason, the show cause action had not vested in the Trustee, I would not have declined to award Mr Rana relief on the grounds of futility. The present proceedings is quite unlike Daemar [No 2] . The High Court, not this Court, is seized of the show cause application. It is not for me to express a view on whether the High Court action is either competent or has any prospects of success. It is for that Court to do so.

Having found that the proceeding A20 of 2008 was one for the Trustee and not Mr Rana to prosecute if it was to be prosecuted at all the Trustee's decision to discontinue it was, on the material before me, unimpeachable. That decision as I have indicated was the only one which raised any issue of substance for the purposes either of the AD(JR) Act or s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act . I have already indicated why there are no grounds at all for providing relief against the Trustee in respect of his decisions (actual or alleged) concerning the other proceedings referred to in Mr Rana's application.

Accordingly, I will give summary judgment in favour of the respondents and will order that the proceeding be dismissed against each respondent. I will also order the applicant pay the costs of each respondent.

<tocase>Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 ; (2007) 230 CLR 89</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/22.html</AustLII>
<text>I am for present purposes obliged to accept the Court's ruling in relation to its characterisation of the proceedings in that case as "an action": Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 ; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135] .

The Bankruptcy Act does not make express provision for actions instituted by a bankrupt after his or her bankruptcy in respect of a cause of action which either predates or post-dates the bankruptcy. The effect of the bankruptcy on that cause of action is said to be governed by s 58 and s 116 of the Act, these being the provisions relating to the vesting of the bankrupt's property in the trustee in bankruptcy and to the property available for distribution among the creditors: see 3 The Laws of Australia, "Bankruptcy" at [3.8.940]. If such be the case, the issue which arises is not, as in Daemar , with the question whether Mr Rana's show cause proceedings is an "action". Rather, it is with whether it is "property" passing to the Trustee under s 58(1) and, if so, whether it is divisible amongst his creditors under s 116(1) or exempted therefrom by s 116(2)(g) (ie is it a "right ... to recover damages or compensation ... for personal injury or wrong done to [him]").

In Daemar Kirby P acknowledged the possibility of "a serious disharmony" between s 60(2) and s 58(1) and their respective operations upon claims brought, respectively, before and after bankruptcy supervened: at 53 and 55. In the case there before the Court, the claim (as noted) was instituted before the bankruptcy and thus fell clearly within s 60(2). His Honour went on to say (at 55): 
 
 If the section is clear, as I believe it to be, the fact that it may sometimes provide a wider provision for a stay on proceedings commenced before bankruptcy than would effectively be secured by proceedings commenced after bankruptcy does not avail the claimant. Especially because the Parliament has specifically adumbrated the exceptions to the operation of the statutory stay, in the terms of s 60(4), this indicates that it attended to the way in which prior civil action should go forward at the option only of the trustee, or be stayed by the statute.

The scheme of Part IV, Division 4 of the Bankruptcy Act (which contains s 58(1) and s 60(2) and (4)) would appear to proceed upon the premise that, subject to s 60(4), all "actions" encompassed by s 60(2) have been vested in the trustee by s 58(1) such that in the administration of the bankrupt's estate, he or she can make the election envisaged by s 60. Such vesting necessarily presupposes that all such actions were the bankrupt's property.</text>

<text>In Cox v Journeux [No 2] [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 Dixon J indicated (at 721) that the test whether the above Bankruptcy Act formula was satisfied was 
 
 ... whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property. 
 

 
The losses of compensation and benefits from the Commonwealth which Mr Rana claims by way of damages are manifestly not so estimated. Rather, they are presumably referable to entitlements which he alleges he has against the Commonwealth and its agencies but of which he has been deprived. To the extent that these make up the major part of the damages he claims, then the causes of action to which they relate have passed to the Trustee to the exclusion of Mr Rana.</text>

As to Mr Rana's alleged cause of action for damages against the University of Adelaide for defamation for which the University was alleged to be vicariously liable, the claim, while hopelessly misconceived, was in form for a personal injury or wrong done to him: s 116(2)(g). As such, it could be said not to be of a type that would vest in the Trustee. Nonetheless, it failed for the same reason as did all of the claims made against the University. The actions giving rise to those claims were done by a person acting in his private capacity and not as an employee of the University. In this sense this claim was integrally interconnected in the proceedings with the other non-personal claims made in SAD 12 of 2008 which made up the real substance of that litigation. In these circumstances I regard it as unnecessary here to enter upon any consideration of apportionment of Mr Rana's claims against the University: cf Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 5 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 115; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 434 at [47] and [51] for the purposes of A20 of 2008. Apportionment was not raised before me in any event. It was for the Trustee, not Mr Rana, to determine whether the show cause application would be prosecuted.</text>
