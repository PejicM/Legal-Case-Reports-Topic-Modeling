<text>1 This is an application brought by Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd ("Hardel Holdings") seeking interlocutory relief by way of an injunction to restrain Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd ("Allmark") from instituting proceedings for the winding up of Hardel Holdings on the basis of presumed insolvency, Hardel Holdings having failed to comply with the statutory demand: see s 459C, s 459Q and s 465A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Hardel Holdings previously applied to have the statutory demand set aside under s 459G of the Corporations Act claiming that it was not indebted to Allmark at all or else that there was a genuine dispute as to its indebtedness. That application was dismissed at the instigation of Hardel Holdings, it being acknowledged that the application had not been served within the time specified in s 459G. It was accepted that the period allowed for an application under s 459G could not be extended: see David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd (rec apptd) v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265.

2 Ordinarily, if a company the subject of a statutory demand wishes to oppose a winding up order notwithstanding its failure to comply with it, it may apply to do so under s 459S of the Corporations Act . The statutory demand procedure created by Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Act does not, though, totally preclude an application for an injunction to restrain an abuse of process in the initiation or prosecution of winding up proceedings founded on non-compliance with statutory demand. As was said by Gummow J in David Grant at 279:
 
 "No doubt, in some circumstances, the new Pt 5.4 may appear to operate harshly. But that is a consequence of the legislative scheme which has been adopted to deal with perceived defects in the pre-existing procedure in relation to notices of demand. It also may transpire that a winding up application in respect of a solvent company is threatened or made for an improper purpose which amounts to an abuse of process in the technical sense of that term, as explained in Williams v Spautz [(1992) [1992] HCA 34 ; 174 CLR 509 at 518-522, 532-537]. However, in an appropriate case, injunctive relief may then be available to the company in a court of general equity jurisdiction."</text>

<text>2 Ordinarily, if a company the subject of a statutory demand wishes to oppose a winding up order notwithstanding its failure to comply with it, it may apply to do so under s 459S of the Corporations Act .

However, in an appropriate case, injunctive relief may then be available to the company in a court of general equity jurisdiction."

3 An abuse of process in the technical sense to which his Honour referred occurs when a party institutes proceedings "for a purpose or to effect an object beyond that which the legal process offers": see Williams v Spautz at 523. Hardel Holdings is alleging in this proceedings that such is the case. It contends that the evidence establishes a prima facie case of Allmark knowingly instituting proceedings against it which it knows to be without foundation but has done so as a tactical manoeuvre in respect of a dispute between two other companies in the Hardel and Allmark families which is presently the subject of legal proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia. Those proceedings seek the winding up of an Allmark company on the basis of non-compliance to the statutory demand.

4 The matter presently before me is for interlocutory relief. It is brought as a matter of urgency because, Hardel Holdings not having satisfied the statutory demand, Allmark is entitled under the Corporations Act to institute proceedings to wind up the company and has indicated it wishes to do so. For its part Hardel Holdings says it will suffer significant prejudice if such a course was to be taken by Allmark, the more so given that the taking of that course would, Hardel contends, constitute a technical abuse of process in the circumstances. The apprehended prejudice making the application an urgent one is that the institution of winding up proceedings against it would trigger default events under, or otherwise would imperil, financing arrangements it has in place for property developments that it is undertaking in several parts of Australia.

5 It is fair to say that the material that has been filed by both parties but in particular by Allmark suffers from opacity and generates some real level of doubt as to what is the true position between the parties in respect of the alleged debt and in respect of such object as Allmark may have had in bringing the proceedings. Nonetheless, serious allegations are made against Allmark.

19 It is well established that the onus of satisfying the court that there is an abuse of process lies upon the party alleging it. That onus is a heavy one and the power to grant a permanent stay is one to be exercised only in the most exceptional circumstances: Williams v Spautz at 529. The present hearing being only of an interlocutory character, a permanent stay is not being sought. Nonetheless, I am mindful of the gravity of the allegation being made and, in consequence of, the need for a prima facie case to be properly established in light of that.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<text>20 The two main inquiries to be addressed in applications for interlocutory injunctive relief have recently been reiterated by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 (see esp [65] ff) and need not be rehearsed at any length here. I would, though, note that the first inquiry "whether the applicant has made out a prima facie case" only requires the applicant to "show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial": ibid [65]. The necessary strength of that likelihood depends upon the nature of the right asserted by the applicant and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order sought: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622. I would add, as well, that, if I am satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out in this matter, the balance of convenience favours the grant of relief. The injury likely to be suffered by Hardel Holdings through its financing arrangements if an injunction was refused would outweigh the injury which Allmark would suffer in being held out of its statutory right. Damages would not adequately compensate Hardel Holdings if an injunction was refused and its right were injured. The final matter I should mention is that, while there is a clear conflict between Mr Harris and Mr Riggs as to the occurrence of conversations, etc between them and while there are serious imputations being made and denied, it is quite inappropriate for me on such an application to make, or to foreshadow, findings on credit.</text>

<tocase>Braams Group Pty Ltd v Miric [2002] NSWCA 417 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 124</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/417.html</AustLII>
<text>21 I have already indicated that the abuse of process procedure cannot properly be used as a collateral method of disputing the existence of a debt: see generally Braams Group Pty Ltd v Miric [2002] NSWCA 417 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 124. This said, I reiterate that Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Act does not preclude the allegation of an abuse of process where the abuse is alleged to be the institution of proceedings for an improper purpose. In this matter the plaintiff alleges such to be the case. For the purposes of making out a prima facie case of this, emphasis is placed upon three particular matters.

22 It is said, first, that there is evidence that should sufficiently satisfy me for present purposes of the likelihood that Allmark (through Mr Riggs) has instituted proceedings against Hardel Holdings in the knowledge that no debt was owed by it and/or that any alleged indebtedness arising out of the joint venture arrangement would be the indebtedness of Stanhope in any event. To the extent that this merely calls into question the existence of the debt, it alone would not satisfy me that a prima facie case of abuse of process has been made out.

23 The second matter relied upon relates to the genuineness of the nine invoices alleged to evidence the debt. There is on the evidence a serious issue raised here. The lack of any historical record of the alleged debt and the provenance of the alleged invoices do suggest there may well be a question as to the genuineness of the invoices. There is Ms Hentzschel's evidence that they were never received by the Hardel Group. Additionally, there is no evidence to demonstrate that project management services were in fact rendered in the period in respect of which the claims were made.</text>
