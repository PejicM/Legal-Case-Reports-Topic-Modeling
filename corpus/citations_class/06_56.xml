<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>3 For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that this is a case in which departure from the ordinary rule according to which a notice of appeal is to be filed and served within a time period prescribed by O 52 r 15(1)(a) is justified (see Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187). Indeed, I am satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for any discretionary relief to be granted to this applicant for the purpose of allowing him to pursue further the application made by him for a protection visa.

4 The applicant arrived in Australia from the People's Republic of China ('the PRC') on 17 May 2000. He applied for a protection visa, using a name which he now acknowledges is not his true name, on an application form which he signed in Chinese characters on 12 November 2000. The application contains an acknowledgment that the applicant had received help completing the form from a registered migration agent, Pricilla International Co Pty Ltd ('Pricilla'). Accompanying the applicant's application for a protection visa is a further document, again signed by the applicant in Chinese characters, by which he appointed Pricilla to act as his agent in dealings with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ('the Department').

5 Annexed to the application is a three page statement in English ('the Statement') which is also signed by the applicant in Chinese characters. It is reasonable to assume that an officer or employee of Pricilla had some involvement in the preparation and completion of all of the documents associated with the applicant's application for a protection visa, including the Statement. It is necessary to refer in some detail below to aspects of the Statement.</text>

<tocase>NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/134.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The draft notice of appeal upon which the applicant, by his counsel, indicated that he would rely should he be granted the extension of time sought by him raised three grounds of appeal. The first proposed ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction in relation to a critical element of the applicant's claim. The particulars of this ground reveal that it is solely concerned with the alleged failure of the Tribunal to understand the case of the applicant with respect to the issue of his passport. The applicant is seeking an extension of time within which to institute an appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court. This ground of appeal must therefore be understood as an assertion that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in not finding that the Tribunal erred in the way alleged. As it was not argued before the Federal Magistrates Court that the Tribunal erred in this regard, the applicant's ability to rely on this ground of appeal is dependent on a finding by this Court that it is expedient in the interests of justice to allow him to rely on the ground (see NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134).

18 The second proposed ground of appeal raised by the draft notice of appeal alleges that the Tribunal erred in a manner amounting to jurisdictional error in the way in which it gave consideration to whether the applicant would face a real risk of persecution as an ordinary practitioner of Falun Gong should he be required to return to the PRC. As in the case of the first of the proposed grounds of appeal, this proposed ground of appeal must be understood as an assertion that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in not finding that the Tribunal erred in the way alleged.

19 The third proposed ground of appeal raised by the draft notice of appeal contends that the Federal Magistrate erred in declining to consider an affidavit filed by the applicant in the Federal Magistrates Court containing information about the applicant's association with the Falun Gong movement in Australia. The Federal Magistrate refused to consider the affidavit on the basis that the evidence contained in it had not been before the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>NAWZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/199.html</AustLII>
<text>30 Understandably, the applicant did not argue that the application for a protection visa which was made with his authority and signed by him, albeit in a false name, was not a valid application (see NAWZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199).

31 I conclude that the applicant's application for a protection visa constituted an attempt to practise deception on the Minister. I am satisfied that he knew that the application had been made in a name that was not his true name. I am further satisfied that the applicant either knew that the Statement was false in material particulars or alternatively took no steps to ensure that the Statement was accurate. The applicant's application to the Tribunal was similarly pressed on a false basis as was his appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court. It was understandably not suggested that the applicant was not throughout aware that his true identity and the contents of the Statement formed critical aspects of his application for a protection visa.

32 The applicant seeks discretionary relief from this Court. In NAWZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs the Full Court declined to grant discretionary relief to an appellant who had attempted to practise deception on the Minister noting at [14] that:
 
 'It is contrary to the public interest for any encouragement to be given to conduct of the type engaged in by the appellant.'

33 In my view, this is also a case in which the public interest requires that discretionary relief be denied to the applicant. The evidence does not support any suggestion, and it was not so submitted, that what the applicant sought to do was simply, in the words of Shakespeare, ' [to] gild refined gold, to paint the lily' (see King John Act IV Scene II). The applicant's application for a protection visa does not merely exaggerate the applicant's experiences in the PRC. The applicant applied for a protection visa using a name that was not his own. As mentioned above, I am satisfied that he did this knowingly and that he has either known throughout the time that he has asserted an entitlement to a protection visa that the contents of the Statement are false in material respects or alternatively that he has been recklessly indifferent concerning the accuracy of the Statement.

34 Moreover, if the applicant were to be allowed to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, it is unclear what claims it will be asserted that the learned Federal Magistrate should have regarded as the legitimate subject matter of the review conducted by the Tribunal.</text>
