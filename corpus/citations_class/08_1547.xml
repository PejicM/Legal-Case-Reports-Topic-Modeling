<tocase>Mier v F N Management Pty Ltd [2006] 1 Qd R 339</tocase>
<text>13 Section 601EE(2) would not confer power on the Court to make an order creating substantive obligations. The true function of the subsection is as described by Keane JA, with whom the other members of the Queensland Court of Appeal agreed, in Mier v F N Management Pty Ltd [2006] 1 Qd R 339 at [15]-[16] as follows:
 15. ... In Joye v Beach Petroleum NL (1996) 67 FCR 275 at 287, 290, the Full Court of the Federal Court approved the statement of McPherson SPJ in Re Crust 'N' Crumb Bakers (Wholesale) Pty Ltd [1992] 2 Qd.R. 76 at 78 that: 
 
 Winding up is a process that consists of collecting the assets, realising and reducing them to money, dealing with proofs of creditors by admitting or rejecting them, and distributing the net proceeds, after providing for costs and expenses, to the persons entitled. 
 
 16. It follows, in my view, that where a statute makes reference, without more, to the "winding up" of an entity, it is referring to the application of a procedure containing these essential characteristics. It follows that s 601EE(2) must be read as empowering a court to make such orders as it considers appropriate in order to apply such a procedure to an unregistered managed investment scheme. It may also be accepted that the terms of the section allow for further orders to be made as needed so long as they are required for the "due conduct and completion of the winding up". The necessary corollary is that an order that could not reasonably be seen as advancing this procedure would not be authorised by s 601EE(2).</text>

<tocase>P v P [1994] HCA 20 ; (1994) 181 CLR 583</tocase>

<text>19 The "law of the Commonwealth" for the purposes of the possible application of s 109 is not the 2002 Order, but s 601EE(2), under which that order is said to have been made: P v P [1994] HCA 20 ; (1994) 181 CLR 583 ; see especially per McHugh J at 635:
 The inconsistency is between the federal law and the State law and not the order of the federal court and the State law.

20 For the reasons already stated, s 601EE(2) was not, and could not have been, a source of power of the 2002 Order insofar as it provided for the payment of the Liquidator's costs and remuneration by the Trust out of the Fund. That source was s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 , an Act of the Tasmanian Parliament dealing with the obligations of the Trust, an entity established under Tasmanian law. Section 109 has no application because no Commonwealth law is relevantly in a condition of possible inconsistency with a State law.

21 The Order governing the winding up should reflect the change in the Trust's obligations consequent upon the 2007 legislation, which is valid.</text>

<tocase>Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699</tocase>
<text>14 In Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [43], Finkelstein J pointed out that the section does not confer substantive obligations. His Honour said:
 43. ...I do not accept that the power conferred by s 601EE(2) is without restriction. In particular, I do not accept that the section permits the court to impose an otherwise nonexistent obligation on a person to provide information to a receiver appointed to wind up a managed investment scheme. It is a well established principle of statutory construction that, in the absence of clearly expressed language to the contrary, courts will presume that legislation is intended to leave individual rights intact.

15 Section 601EE(2) does not confer on this Court the power to impose a legally enforceable obligation to pay the remuneration and costs of a liquidator on persons who previously bore no such obligation. Once that truism is accepted, the form of the 2002 variation to the 2001 Order is perfectly understandable. After the Tasmanian Parliament had enacted s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 , it would have been confusing and misleading to leave the 2001 Order in its existing form. Viewed objectively in the light of the surrounding circumstances, the purpose of the variation was to make the Order show what the source of the Liquidator's remuneration was now to be, given the recent enactment of s 108(2)(a)(iii).

16 Subsequent variations to the 2001 Order in 2007 and 2008 do not affect this conclusion. The variation in 2007 simply provided procedures for detailing expenses which consisted of legal fees. It also provided a further avenue for review by the Court, additional to those contained in par 2(c)(i) and (ii) of the 2001 Order (which provided, in general terms, for ASIC, Piggott Wood &amp; Baker, any investor in the scheme, or the Liquidator to apply to the Court for directions). The 2007 provision, par 2(c)(iii), for the Court's review is specifically directed to the District Registrar's review of the Liquidator's claim for costs and remuneration.</text>
