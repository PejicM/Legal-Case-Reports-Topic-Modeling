<tocase>Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/951.html</AustLII>
<text>5 In 2003 Mr Reid sought, unsuccessfully, to have that native title claim struck out for want of authorisation: see Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951.

6 After filing the application on 24 May 2007, Mr Reid purported to file two further amended applications, one on 14 June 2007, the other on 9 July 2007. I have had regard to these for the purposes of the State's motion and, formally, I have proceeded as if leave had been given to file and serve that of 14 June 2007. The State's submissions proceeded on that basis. I took this course because I would in any event have had to strike out the original application because, according to the express terms used in Schedule of O of that application, Mr Reid was, as a member of another claim group, "specifically excluded from this application's claim group".

7 The Schedule A claim group is made up of a two page list of 103 named persons followed by the reference to "other living Kokatha persons as described in Attachment A". Mr Reid claims that access to this Attachment is "restricted". The Attachment provided greater detail about Mr Reid and the named persons and then continues:
 
 
 "4. The Claim group also has the capacity to contain descendents of prior attendees and participants in KPC meetings and activities , (if they are not already in the claim group) and if they are have the necessary ancestry relating to inheritance (i.e. if they are valid Kokatha). Such live persons or live descendents will be included in the claim group in due course (at the discretion of KPC Elders and Advisors). 
 
 5. The Claim Group also has the capacity to contain live descendents of prior Custodians over parts of the Kokatha Nation Territory. Such persons will be included in the claim group in due course (at the discretion of KPC Elders and Advisors).
 
 6. The Claim Group also has the capacity to contain adopted persons from other tribes (and their Kokatha descendents) using criteria such as whether such people acknowledge and are schooled in Kokatha law and custom, participate in Kokatha activities, or have valid interests in part of Kokatha Nation territory. (The exact criteria that [sic] used will be up to the Elders to decide)."

<tocase>Harrington-Smith v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/31.html</AustLII>
<text>24 As Lindgren J commented in Harrington-Smith v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 at [72] :
 
 "The expression 'native title claim group' is defined in s 253 to mean, relevantly, the native title claim group mentioned in this passage. The expression is commonly and understandably used to refer to the group on whose behalf a native title determination application claimant application is made. Indeed, Form 1, prescribed by para 5(1)(a) of the Native Title (Federal Court) Regulations 1998 (Cth), uses the expression in that sense, treating 'claimants' and members of the 'native title claim group' as synonymous. But there is no escaping the fact that the 'native title claim group', all of whose members are required by s 61(1) to authorise the applicant to apply, is a group constituted by all the actual holders, according to their traditional laws and customs, of the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed."

25 Section 61(4) provides that where a native title application is one authorised by a claim group the application must (a) name the persons constituting the group or (b) otherwise describe the persons sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons.

26 "Authorisation" for the purposes of s 61(1) is defined in s 251B as follows:
 
 "For the purposes of this Act, all the persons in a native title claim group ... authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application ... and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if:
 
 
 
 (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group ... must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind the persons in the native title claim group ... authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or 
 
 (b) where there is no such process the persons in the native title claim group ... authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group ... in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind."
 (Original emphasis)

29 I have noted above the tie between group membership and authorisation. Of the significance of authorisation I need do more than gratefully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in Harrington-Smith (No 9) at [1171]-[1172]:
 
 "'Proper authorisation is the foundation for the institution and maintenance of a native title claimant application under s 61 of the new Act': Perry and Lloyd , Australian Native Title Law (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2003) at [3.140] p 439. Authorisation is 'fundamental to the legitimacy of native title determination applications', and is 'not a condition to be met by formulaic statements in or in support of applications': Strickland at 259-260.
 
 Where the authorisation requirement of s 61(1) is not complied with, the non-compliance is fatal to the success of the application: Moran v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 at [48] ; Strickland at [56]-[57] (approved in WA v Strickland at [77]-[78]); Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169 at [10] ; Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 (FCA) at [11]; De Rose FCA/O'Loughlin J at [933]. Authorisation must be by all the persons who constitute the native title claim group in respect of the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed: Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [30] ; Dieri People v South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 at [55] ( 'Dieri People' ); Tilmouth v 
 Northern Territory [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240."</text>

<tocase>Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/264.html</AustLII>
<text>27 It is well-accepted that "[t]he proper identification of the native title claim group is the central or focal issue of a native title determination application": Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at [35] . It is that group which provides the authorisation under s 251B: see Harrington-Smith (No 9) , at [1186] ff. It is in that group's favour that a determination, if successful, is made: ibid; see also Colbung v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 774.

35 I would add that it is unsurprising that the definition of the group itself suffers the above vices. Mr Reid's claim seeks to replace the Kokatha Native Title claim. The claim group itself reflects a house divided. The consequences of this becomes the more apparent when one turns to the authorisation requirement: cf the comments of Mansfield J in Landers at [38].

36 I consider that the application does not comply with the requirements of s 61 of the Act.

37 The evidence on authorisation has been set out above. While the Form 1 suggests three distinct bases of authorisation (i) self-authorisation, (ii) authorisation by Elders of surrounding Western Desert Tribes and (iii) authorisation by KPC members at a meeting on 17 March 2007 the application itself does not betray whether these are intended to be alternative or cumulative. What is said in the Form 1 is not replicated precisely in the accompanying affidavit. No reference is made to self-authorisation. I note in passing that (i) there is no evidence provided by Mr Reid that the enumerated claim group acknowledge his power of self-authorisation; and (ii) Mr Reid has attempted to secure the signatures of some, but by no means all, of the listed claim group both to a copy of the list and to an attached claim map both unnecessary steps if Mr Reid could self-authorise. Equally in Attachment R, reference is made to Elders at the Spear Creek meeting and to the fact that some of those "have now authorized Mr Reid to attend to Kokatha Native Title matters". It is not at all clear whether these Elders were Western Desert Elders (as para 3 of Part A2 of Form 1 might suggest), or were Kokatha Elders (as the Attachment R comments on the KPC meeting would suggest).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1589.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The requirements that the group be constituted by all the actual native title holders and that a determination, if successful, is to be made in their favour carry with them two consequences. The first is that a subset or part of what truly constitutes a native title group cannot itself be a claimant group under s 61(1): Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61] ; although in some, though by no means all, instances, there may be good reason for hesitation in readily concluding that an alleged group is only a sub-group or part of a group for s 84C purposes: see McKenzie v State of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at [41]. The second is that where the class membership is described, not listed, there must be descriptive certainty of the class, i.e. the application must describe the persons who are within the class "sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons": cf 61(4)(b) and McKenzie at [42]-[43].

29 I have noted above the tie between group membership and authorisation. Of the significance of authorisation I need do more than gratefully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in Harrington-Smith (No 9) at [1171]-[1172]:

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/226.html</AustLII>
<text>30 Finally I should note that s 84C(1) provides that, if an application does not comply with s 61, s 61A or s 62, a party to the proceedings may at any time apply to this Court to strike it out. All I need observe here is that the court's power should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable upon the "version of the evidence" favourable to the respondent to the strike out: McKenzie , at [26]; Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77.

31 It is submitted by the State that the described native title claim group is flawed in two respects: (i) it is descriptively uncertain in that, beyond the listed members, the group may be expanded to include persons of certain characteristics at the discretion of certain people: see para 4-6 of Attachment A quoted earlier; and (ii) the present group is only part of the group acknowledged by Mr Reid to be capable of being brought within it as witness the exclusion of persons previously acknowledged by him and by Kokatha lawmen to be representatives of the Kokatha people, the suggestion that Mr Reid is able to add thousands to the claim group and the assertion that members of the claim group are members of the KPC, although as such they bring a claim "for Kokatha people": see the affidavit accompanying the application quoted above.

32 It is unnecessary for me to express a concluded view on the former the descriptive uncertainty submission as I am satisfied that the claim group as described is merely part of a group. Nonetheless, I would comment that there is an arguable case of uncertainty in the description of the possible members who may be given entry to the group in the future. These are envisaged by clauses 4 to 6 of Attachment A. They may or may not be admitted to the group at the discretion of KPC elders. Leaving to one side the arresting character of the stated criteria of cl 4 (prior attendance and participation in KPC meetings etc), there is nothing to suggest that the discretions given are a product of, and are to be informed by, the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the aboriginal peoples holding the native title rights and interests in question. The clauses may well be vulnerable at this point for this reason.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1056.html</AustLII>
<text>46 Attachment A to the application indicates that the listed members of the claim group are KPC members. The KPC constitution ties membership to acceptance by Mr Reid. The KPC, though, is not a holder of native title rights and interests. Neither can it authorise a native title claim: cf Briggs v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2004] FCA 1056 ; (2004) 209 ALR 75. A native title group whose members are the members of an incorporated association may, where there is no relevant and mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the making and conduct of a claimant application, agree to and adopt a process for those purposes: see s 251B(b) and Bolton v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760 at [44] . There is no reason in principle to prevent them agreeing to, and adopting a process which utilises a meeting of their association. But, as French J indicated in Bolton at [44], the s 251B(b) requirement necessitates that the authorisation process must be able to be traced to a decision of the native title group who adopt that process.</text>

<text>46 Attachment A to the application indicates that the listed members of the claim group are KPC members. The KPC constitution ties membership to acceptance by Mr Reid. The KPC, though, is not a holder of native title rights and interests. Neither can it authorise a native title claim: cf Briggs v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2004] FCA 1056 ; (2004) 209 ALR 75. A native title group whose members are the members of an incorporated association may, where there is no relevant and mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the making and conduct of a claimant application, agree to and adopt a process for those purposes: see s 251B(b) and Bolton v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760 at [44] . There is no reason in principle to prevent them agreeing to, and adopting a process which utilises a meeting of their association. But, as French J indicated in Bolton at [44], the s 251B(b) requirement necessitates that the authorisation process must be able to be traced to a decision of the native title group who adopt that process.

47 It is at this point of tracing back that the alleged authorisation's ineffectiveness becomes apparent. While there is evidence that the less than 20 of the 103 members of the claim group who were present at the meeting voted unanimously for the application to be made, there is no evidence at all that such notice of the meeting as was given, advertised other than that an AGM was to be held. There is nothing to suggest that the group members were being asked to agree to and adopt a non-traditional process for authorising a claimant application. This would, of itself, be enough to reject the legitimacy of the claimed authorisation process. Further, and in light both of the evidence on notice and of the limited attendance, there is no reasonably arguable basis on which one could infer that the meeting was fairly representative of the claim group: see Bolton at [46]. There is not, in my view, any arguable basis for contending that the meeting was in the circumstances adequate to satisfy the requirements of s 251B(b).

48 For the above reasons I have ordered that the application be struck out under s 84C of the Native Title Act .

49 I will order that my order suspending the above order be vacated.</text>

<tocase>McKenzie v State of South Australia [2006] FCA 891</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/891.html</AustLII>
<text>53 In McKenzie v State of South Australia [2006] FCA 891 at [8] I referred to the case law on s 85A. Here I need only repeat what I said there:
 
 "The most authoritative statement of the matters which should inform the exercise of discretion in awarding costs in light of this section was given by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305, in comments later endorsed by the Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 137. His Honour noted first, that s 85A(1) is intended to remove the expectation that costs will follow the event but that despite this, the Court retains its discretion as to costs unlimited by subrule (1); secondly the 'unreasonable conduct' of the parties is not a jurisdictional fact which preconditions the exercise of the discretion and, conversely, s 85A(2) will not control or limit the discretion in subrule (1); thirdly, whilst the exercise of the discretion when making a costs order should be judicial, the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs."

61 I do not go so far as to say that, where a strike out motion is brought, a native title claimant is entitled as of course to have that motion determined without fear of an adverse costs order: cf McKenzie [2006] FCA 891 where costs orders were made on an application to discontinue under the shadow of an apprehended strike out motion. Each case must depend on its own circumstances. In the present matter I attribute particular importance to Mr Reid's being an unrepresented person who received spasmodic legal and other assistance which clearly was unequal to the challenge presented by the strike out motion; the motion was brought within a very short period after the filing of the application and the matter was dealt with expeditiously because of its potential to impact on the overlap proceedings. Mr Reid did not capitulate in the face of the flaws indicated to him by the State. He clearly erred in so doing. On balance, though, I do not consider that he so unreasonably caused the State and the ALRM to incur costs in connection with the conduct of the proceeding, or otherwise so acted as to warrant an adverse costs order.

62 Accordingly, I will make no order as to costs.

63 I would add this. Both the State and the ALRM in their submissions sought a costs order, inter alia, for the purpose of providing a clear message to any further potential native title claimants that it is necessary to ensure that matters of form and procedure are strictly to be adhered to when lodging claimant applications. As I earlier indicated, I do not regard deterrence to be a permissible reason for a costs order. This said, the fact and circumstances of this successful strike out motion ought be of no little interest to persons who have made, or who are contemplating making, claimant applications in relation to claim areas that overlap that in the Kokatha overlap proceedings. 

 I certify that the preceding sixty-three (63) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.

<tocase>Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/59.html</AustLII>
<text>54 The one additional comment I should make is that it is not proper to use the power to award costs to punish either a successful or an unsuccessful party: cf Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 566-567; or as a deterrent to other would-be applicants. I refer to these matters as Mr Reid clearly has been an irritant to others involved in the Kokatha Overlap Proceedings (SAD 6013 of 1998) and his stances and actions have, probably, in some degree impacted adversely upon their expectations in the conduct of those proceedings.

55 The parties have filed written submissions on this matter. I do not intend to outline them in any detail. I have had regard to them. There are, though, two matters arising out of the submissions made by Mr Reid's counsel to which I should refer lest he continue to labour under several obvious illusions. First, I did not strike out Mr Reid's claim because of an alleged misunderstanding arising out of responses he made to questions I asked him and to which I referred above at [11] to [13]. Secondly, I did not strike out the application for the reason that I did not want it to get in the way of a scheduled case management conference.

56 It is clear that the application itself was a product of Mr Reid's increasing dissatisfaction both with the conduct of the Kokatha Native Title claim and with the overlap proceedings (SAD 6013 of 1998) in relation to the Barngala applicants. Even though he had other avenues open to him to express his point of view after his unsuccessful attempt to strike out the Kokatha Native Title Claim, I am satisfied that his own application was brought in good faith and I am satisfied that as a litigant in person for all practical purposes, he acted reasonably in instituting the proceedings even though the application itself was misconceived when considered in light of the distinctive requirements of the Native Title Act . I am not prepared to assume in light of his previous involvements in proceedings relating to the Kokatha Native Title claim that he should be regarded as adequately versed in the mysteries of the Native Title Act and hence as bearing the risk of his misconceptions. Further, I am not satisfied that the timing of his application was informed by some improper motive and in particular that of disrupting the conduct of other proceedings to the extent of any overlap: see s 67 of the Act. I accept that health considerations and the paucity of advice and assistance go far to explain the timing of the application.</text>
