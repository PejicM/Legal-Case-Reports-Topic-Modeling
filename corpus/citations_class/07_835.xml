<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/17.html</AustLII>
<text>81 As the High Court said in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604:
 
 ...the section was not intended to impose, by a side-wind, an overlay of Commonwealth law upon every field of legislative control into which a corporation might stray for the purposes of, or in connection with, carrying on its trading or commercial activities. What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it (or those whose interest it represents or is seeking to promote) has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.

<tocase>Deatons Proprietary Limited v Flew [1949] HCA 60 ; (1949) 79 CLR 370</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/60.html</AustLII>
<text>104 In Deatons Proprietary Limited v Flew [1949] HCA 60 ; (1949) 79 CLR 370, the question was whether an assault upon a customer of a hotel by a barmaid in the employ of the publican company was committed in the course of her employment. Dixon J said at 380:
 
 In my opinion, however, it is clear that, upon the case made for the plaintiff, a finding could not be supported that the barmaid acted in the course of her employment so that the defendant company would be vicariously liable. For upon the plaintiff's case the assault was as unexplained as it was unprovoked and might have proceeded from private spite on the part of the barmaid or from some other cause quite unconnected with her occupation or employment. So far as the plaintiff's case went to show, nothing occurred which would in any way relate her action to the duties of her office or explain it by reference to anything incidental to what she was employed to do.

105 Williams J said at 386:
 
 The damage to the plaintiff was done by the glass. A barmaid who throws an empty glass at a customer is not doing an act of the class which she is employed to do. To throw the beer, much less the glass, at a customer is not a mode, although an improper mode, of serving a customer with beer, and even less a mode, although an improper mode, of answering his request for a glass of beer.</text>

<tocase>New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/4.html</AustLII>
<text>106 In New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511, the majority of the High Court, (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, and Callinan JJ, with McHugh J dissenting) held that the liability of a school authority, under its non-delegable duty of care over the pupils, does not extend to intentional criminal conduct against a pupil by a teacher employed by the authority.

107 Gummow and Hayne JJ, after referring to the judgment of Sir Owen Dixon in Deatons said, at 591-592:
 
 First, vicarious liability may exist if the wrongful act is done in intended pursuit of the employer's interests or in intended performance of the contract of employment. Secondly, vicarious liability may be imposed where the wrongful act is done in ostensible pursuit of the employer's business or in the apparent execution of authority which the employer holds out the employee as having. 
 
 What unites those elements is the identification of what the employee is actually employed to do or is held out by the employer as being employed to do. It is the identification of what the employee was actually employed to do and held out as being employed to do that is central to any inquiry about course of employment.

108 Mrs Barrick knew that Ms Holness was directing money to her bank account from Qantas Catering. She was sharing that money with Ms Holness. She knew that the monies being paid into her accounts by Qantas Catering were greatly in excess of the wages and other payments to which she was entitled. Her claim that she thought the monies included Ms Holness' pay is not true. Mrs Barrick cannot hold Qantas Catering liable for the arrangement she had with Ms Holness.</text>

<tocase>Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited (1995) 195 CLR 410</tocase>
<text>180 As the High Court make plain in Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited (1995) 195 CLR 410 at 420, damages is not available as a separate remedy.

181 Because of the fraudulent scheme orchestrated by the pay-mistress, Ms Holness, Qantas Catering did not comply with the requirements of cl 13(e) of the Award, in my opinion. This failure, however, does not avail Mrs Barrick, because, in my view, she received payslips which indicated what was being paid to her, or on her behalf, to her bank and other loan accounts; those monies were recorded in payslips which she received, and the monies exceeded the entitlements for the hours that she worked.

182 None of the other causes of action has been made out.</text>
