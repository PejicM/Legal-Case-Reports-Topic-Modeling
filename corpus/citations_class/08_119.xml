<text>4 The notice of appeal contains two grounds. The first is that the Tribunal breached its duty under s 424A of the Act . Although there was no argument put to me to support this allegation, I have had regard to the decisions and reasons of the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal, and I am not persuaded there has been any breach of that section. I agree with the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate in relation to the authority of SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , namely, that s 424A of the Act is not engaged by statements which merely point to inconsistencies in an applicant's evidence.

5 In relation to the second ground of appeal, which is that the Tribunal failed to refer to sufficient independent country information to properly consider the appellant's application, I am not persuaded that this ground has any force for three reasons. The first reason is because the decision as to what constitutes sufficient independent country information is a matter for the Tribunal; it is purely a question of fact which is not capable of giving rise to a jurisdictional error and cannot be entered into by this Court. Secondly, the decision as to what type of independent country information should be consulted is again a matter for the Tribunal which cannot be the subject of review. Finally, there is no indication either in the submissions of the appellant or on the face of the Tribunal's reasons as to any way in which other independent country information was not taken into account. In the absence of any reference to specific material which it is said ought to have been taken into account, this ground of appeal cannot succeed.

6 Accordingly, for these reasons, I conclude that the appeal ought to be dismissed, and that costs be fixed in a lump sum of $2,280.00.
