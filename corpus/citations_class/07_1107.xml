<text>1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate who dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse the appellant a protection visa. Details of the appellant's visa application, the decision of the Tribunal and the reasons of the Federal Magistrate are set out in the decision of the Federal Magistrate, SZIKZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 487 , which is available on the Internet.

2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. In his protection visa application he claimed a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of being a Falun Gong practitioner and an imputed role as a regional head of Falun Gong. He claimed that his wife became a member in 1996 and he became a member in 1997 after learning about Falun Gong from her. He claimed his wife was the leading member in their town and had connections with organisations all over the world. He claimed that in 1999 he organised members for the district for demonstrations and missions in Beijing. In January 2005 the appellant was detained by police for 10 days. The police told him that they believed he was the head of Falun Gong in the town. His wife bribed a government official for his release and obtained a passport and a visa to Australia.

3 On 25 November 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to attend a hearing on 6 January 2006. On 5 December the Tribunal received a change of contact details form indicating that the appellant still lived at his residential address but his mailing address had changed. On 6 December 2005 the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellant at his new mailing address enclosing a copy of the hearing invitation letter. The earlier hearing letter sent on 24 November was returned to the Tribunal with advice that the appellant no longer lived at that address. The appellant did not attend at the hearing on 6 January 2006 and did not contact the Tribunal to explain his failure to attend.</text>
