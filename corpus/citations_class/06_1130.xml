<tocase>Tapgnuk v Northern Land Council (1996) 5 NTLR 109</tocase>
<text>Before the Deed of Grant was made, the Kamu made representations to the NLC. They did so because the NLC is required by s 23 and 24 of the ALRA to determine who are the 'traditional Aboriginal owners' of land that has been the subject of a grant under the ALRA: see Tapgnuk v Northern Land Council (1996) 5 NTLR 109 ( Tapgnuk ). They said their traditional ownership in the eastern part of the claim area had not been recognised. They challenged the Commissioner's findings that the Malak Malak were the traditional owners of the land granted, and the findings that as a group of people the Kamu no longer existed.

The NLC's function under ss 23 and 24 of the ALRA is a significant one. It accepts that, in performing its function, it must comply with the rules of procedural fairness. It endeavoured to do so by adopting an adjudicative process (described below) including hearing evidence and submissions from the Malak Malak and from the Kamu.

The dispute between the Malak Malak and the Kamu could not be resolved informally. The NLC therefore established the Committee to make findings and recommendations in relation to the traditional ownership of the disputed part of the land contained within the Land Trust.

In Tapgnuk, Angel J expressly declined to declare that the NLC was bound by the findings in the Toohey Report in exercising its function of determining who are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land in the name of the Land Trust. The application by or on behalf of the Malak Malak to have the NLC reject the claimed interest of the Kamu in part of that land was unsuccessful. The NLC had to make its own decisions as to who the traditional owners were at a relevant time. His Honour at 114-115, in reaching that conclusion, considered the obligation on the NLC under s 23(3) to have regard to and to consult with 'the traditional Aboriginal owners (if any) of the land' as indicating a legislative intention that the NLC should form its own view on that matter. Otherwise (apart from Schedule 1 land) the words 'if any' would be otiose. Section 24 empowering the NLC to compile a register of the traditional Aboriginal owners, in Angel J's view at 115-116, fortified that conclusion by the use of the words 'in the opinion of the Council'.

At 117, Angel J said: 
 
 'The initial starting point, for both the Commissioner and the Land Council, must be the definition of "traditional Aboriginal owner" (and all that it incorporates) within s 3(1) of the Act. As a consequence the same considerations that a Land Commissioner applies must be applied by the Council. Providing the Council forms its opinion in accordance with law, it is entitled to form a contrary view to the Land Commissioner. Such a contrary view could only be formed in limited circumstances; if traditional Aboriginal owners change through succession over time; if the Land Commissioner failed to identify all the traditional Aboriginal owners; or, if the Land Commissioner's inquiry was seriously flawed in some material respect.'

I agree with the submission that his Honour's use of the word 'could' in that passage should be understood as meaning only that, in a practical sense, a different factual decision on the composition of the traditional Aboriginal owners will only be made following a report of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in the rare type of circumstances to which his Honour referred.

As its title indicates, the claim area concerned part of the area through which the Daly River runs in a roughly north-westerly direction towards the coast. The Toohey Report includes two maps, one of which identifies the many sites of significance within the area of the land grant. The eastern portion of the claim area includes two sites (numbered 146 and 47) in respect of which the key person is said to be Kitty Pan Quee. Mrs Pan Quee was recognised in the Toohey Report as a surviving Kamu person.

The map comprising part of the Committee Report reveals that the contentious sites Jirigij (Jugirij), Jebenyi, Kabamal (Kabumal), Ngulukmoenet, Coppermine Graves, Ngalyuwuy, and the Mt Hayward area in the vicinity of Wani-Alawun are in the central eastern or upper eastern part of the land trust area, as is the site Durk Koen.

The Toohey Report at [16] recognised that the Malak Malak not only identify themselves and distinguish themselves from other tribunal or linguistic groups, but do so to emphasise that they are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land because they are Malak Malak. It also recognised at [20] that the position of the Kamu is 'crucial' to the claim, as there was evidence that Kamu country used to run from upstream of the Daly River roughly in the eastern section of the claim area. The thesis with which Justice Toohey was presented in evidence was that by 1932 the Kamu dialect was practically extinct, that by about that time the Malak Malak (a group comprising the integration of the Malak Malak and the Madngele people) had taken over responsibility for the former Kamu area, and that Mrs Pan Quee had said that she wanted the Malak Malak to look after the former Kamu area but preserving only hunting and foraging rights for herself.

The Committee identified its task as applying the statutory definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' to the material presented to it, including the evidence of the Aboriginal people themselves, to decide whether the Kamu or the Malak Malak are the traditional owners of the disputed country. In doing so, it said it followed the guidance of Angel J in Tapgnuk at 117. It said it would give 'proper weight and respect to the findings' in the Toohey Report.

The Committee noted at [32] that some 20 years had elapsed since the Toohey Report, and that over that time the circumstances of the Aboriginal people concerned have changed significantly. It noted at [32] that the core Malak Malak people now are Albert Myoung and his five sisters, all of whom reside on the Land trust area and all of whom speak Malak Malak and know a lot about the area.

The Committee noted at [33] that the Kamu, the core element being Mrs Pan Quee's children and grandchildren, have since the Toohey Report sought to be recognised as the traditional Aboriginal owners of the eastern part of the Land Trust land. They acknowledge that Mrs Pan Quee told Justice Toohey that she was giving the Kamu land to the Malak Malak, but they dispute that they thereby (or otherwise) ceased to be its traditional Aboriginal owners. They do not live on that land, but since the Toohey Report have visited and camped there including in rudimentary buildings for lengthy periods. The Kamu language is no longer spoken, but the Kamu (in particular Marjorie Foster one of the five sisters and her children) profess a strong sense of identity as Kamu and as Aboriginal people associated with Kamu country in the Daly River region and are likely to pass it on in turn to their children.

Once it was accepted that the Committee was obliged to address the competing claims of the Malak Malak and the Kamu under the ALRA and was not bound to adopt the conclusions in the Toohey Report (in accordance with the decision of Angel J in Tapgnuk ), the Committee had to determine, among other things, whether the Kamu were a 'local descent group' who had common spiritual affiliations to a site or sites in the Land Trust area. Its abbreviated expression simply reflects its findings on that matter a matter required to be addressed by the ALRA and its findings that, in respect of some sites, within the Land Trust area, the Malak Malak also had common spiritual affiliations to certain of the same sites. I do not consider that its approach to the question posited by the definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' in the ALRA was infected by some misplaced pre-conception about how that task should be carried out. The Committee has identified the correct question. It has had regard to the evidence. And it has reached a conclusion on the issue it was required to address, and explained how it came to that conclusion.

Although the Malak Malak did not contend that the Committee could not use its general knowledge and experience, and did not contend (subject to the first mentioned contention above, which I have rejected) that as a matter of fact there could never be shared country between Aboriginal groups at the margins of neighbouring country, they nevertheless criticised the evidence identified in the Kamu submissions that in fact there was certain shared country between the Malak Malak and the Kamu. They did so because the evidence referred to was evidence also before Justice Toohey, but had not led to a conclusion in the Toohey Report that the Kamu continued to exist as traditional Aboriginal owners of part of the Land Trust area. I do not consider that criticism demonstrates any reviewable error on the part of the Committee. There was clearly such evidence before Justice Toohey. I do not need to refer to it. But the Committee was required to come to its own conclusions, and it did so having regard not only to the evidence before Justice Toohey (and the conclusions in the Toohey Report) but also to the additional evidence which it received and to which it referred. That further evidence went to the existence of the Kamu as a local descent group, and to that group's common spiritual affiliations with certain sites within the Land Trust area.

I do not accept that the Committee's report indicates that it failed properly to apply the requirements of the ALRA and somehow strayed into 'some kind of middle ground' to accommodate the interests of each party. Nor do I accept that the passages complained of reflect that the Committee assumed that, in the case of the competing claimants which it was considering, the solution should be some form of sharing. For the reasons I have given, upon my reading of the Committee's report, it simply recognised the questions it had to address and, having addressed them, it concluded in fact that, in respect of certain sites, the responsibility and common spiritual associations of the Malak Malak and of the Kamu overlapped.</text>

<text>The NLC took the view that it should not play an active role in these proceedings except in one respect, because there is a proponent and an opponent to the claims made. That was a proper approach: R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 at 33-35. It made submissions concerning its powers and the proper construction of the ALRA. It took that position because there was no intervention by the Attorney-General or other public officer to inform the Court on those issues, beyond the particular interests of the parties. In my view, the NLC acted consistently with the decision in Hardiman in adopting that role: see e.g. TXU Electricity Ltd v Office of the Regulator-General [2001] VSC 4 ; (2001) 3 VR 93 at [44] .</text>

<tocase>Northern Land Council v Olney (1992) 34 FCR 470</tocase>
<text>The ALRA provides for the granting of traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of Aboriginals and for other purposes. Its scheme has been explained by the High Court in Risk v Northern Territory [2002] HCA 23 ; (2002) 210 CLR 392 at 398-403 and 409-412. See also Northern Land Council v Olney (1992) 34 FCR 470 at 475-478.

The parties were agreed that the fact that, because the definitions of both 'traditional Aboriginal owners' and of 'Aboriginal tradition' are expressed in the present tense, the identity of traditional owners may evolve somewhat over time, and that the strength of spiritual affiliations to sites and spiritual responsibility for sites may vary in strength from time to time: see e.g. per Brennan J in The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Proprietary Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1983) 158 CLR 327 ( Meneling Station ) at 359; and Northern Land Council v Olney (1992) 34 FCR 470 at 485. Senior counsel for the Malak Malak pointed out, without demur, that the functions of a Land Council are the same whether the land the subject of a land grant under the ALRA followed a recommendation of the Land Rights Commissioner or was Schedule 1 land. The focus on the present traditional Aboriginal owners is also recognised in ss 19(5), 23(1)(e)(i), 23(3), 42(2)(a), 42(3) and 46(4)(a) of the ALRA. A Land Council is empowered by s 24(a) to compile and maintain a register of the names of persons who, in the opinion of the Land Council, are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the Aboriginal land in the area of the Land Council.

The distribution between those two categories was recognised by Brennan J in Meneling Station at 358 and 360; by Wilson and Brennan JJ in Re Toohey; Ex parte Stanton (1982) 44 ALR 94 ( Stanton ) at 100 and 104 respectively; and by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 479. It emerges clearly enough from provisions of the ALRA: see e.g. ss 23(1)(b), (c) and (e), and s 71. As the contentions of the Malak Malak point out, the Committee report does not explicitly refer to that broader category.

The issue has not been the subject of direct judicial determination, although Justice Toohey as the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in his Report in the Finniss River Land Claim in 1981 appears to have accepted at [100], [218], [220], [225] and [234] that there may be more than one group of traditional Aboriginal owners of a particular site or area of country. I do not consider the observations of Brennan J in Meneling Station at 356-360 support the contention of the Malak Malak. That case relevantly concerned s 50(3) of the ALRA. If anything, in my view, his Honour's remarks at 358 suggest that there may be more than one group of traditional Aboriginal owners. His Honour said of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner's function under s 50(1) that it requires him: 
 
 '... to evaluate the spiritual affiliations and spiritual responsibility of any local descent group of Aboriginals who may claim to be traditional owners of the land in question or who may appear to have a traditional claim to that land.' (my emphasis)
 

Moreover, Meneling Station concerned the Finniss River Land Claim Report, so that such an approach by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner may have attracted some judicial comment if it were not consistent with the ALRA. It also appears that the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 490 contemplated the possibility of there being more than one local descent group each having common spiritual affiliations to a site.

That construction is consistent with a number of reports of Aboriginal Land Commissioners under the ALRA. They are noted in Neate , Aboriginal Land Rights Law in the Northern Territory, Alternative Publishing Co-operative Ltd, Sydney, 1989 at Ch 3 fn 298. Since 1989, a number of similar reports have been made, including Justice Gray in the Jawoyn (Gimbat Area) Land Claim Report, 1995 (especially at [4.28]) and Justice Olney in the Wakaya/Alawarre Land Claim Report, 1990 (especially at [5.8]). I note, as senior counsel for the Malak Malak pointed out, both those reports concerned claimant groups who were not competing with each other. Moreover, that construction in my view is consistent with giving the ALRA a broad construction so as to give effect to the beneficial purpose for which it was intended: see e.g. R v Kearney; Ex parte Jurlama [1984] HCA 14 ; (1984) 158 CLR 426 at 433; and Northern Land Council v Olney at 479. It is unlikely that the ALRA was intended either to exclude altogether from the traditional ownership both local descent groups if (for example) there were found to be two local descent groups each with the specified characteristics in relation to a particular site, or alternatively to force a decision between competing local descent groups on some unspecified basis when reach was found to have the specified characteristics in relation to a particular site.

Once it is accepted that, as a matter of law, there may be two groups of persons who are each traditional Aboriginal owners of particular sites or country, the fact that there are competing groups making mutually exclusive claims is simply a matter the decision-maker must take into account. It doe not follow that the decision-maker, having taken all relevant material into account, will err in a reviewable way if both groups are found to be traditional Aboriginal owners. As the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney said at 487: 
 
 '... the question whether or not a group of claimants can establish its status as traditional Aboriginal owners of the land is ultimately a question of applying the statute to the particular facts as found.'

The Malak Malak point out that the statutory definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' refers to 'common' spiritual affiliations to a site on the relevant country. That requirement of commonality is one which the members of a local descent group must enjoy as among themselves. It is not a requirement that, in the case of there being more than one local descent group, all the members of each local descent group must collectively enjoy commonality of spiritual affiliations. It is plain that subpar (a) of the definition prescribes a particular characteristic for a local descent group.

As I have indicated, the definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' is satisfied only if the group of Aboriginals who comprise a local descent group have 'common spiritual affiliations' to a site on the land. That requirement was explained by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 485-488. It is clearly a requirement, or characteristic, which a local descent group must satisfy before it comes within the definition. Where a local descent group has that characteristic in relation to a site on the land (and also satisfies the other elements of the definition) it will qualify as traditional Aboriginal owners in relation to that land. If there are two local descent groups who so qualify, by the application of the statute, they each enjoy that status in relation to that land. There is no requirement in the definition that the members of each such group must then be found collectively to have 'common spiritual affiliations' with that land. It therefore is not to the point, in my view, at least in relation to this contention, that there are examples where the Malak Malak and the Kamu gave different evidence as to the nature of their respective common spiritual affiliations with particular sites such as Jebenyi or Ngulukmoenet/Kabamal or the area of Mt Hayward called Wani Alawun by the Malak Malak and Ngalyuwuy by the Kamu.

Those observations indicate why I also do not accept the further contention of the Malak Malak that the Committee erred in proceeding on the basis that there can be more than one 'land-owning group' in relation to a particular area of land in circumstances where the members of both groups do not hold spiritual affiliations in common with each other.

It is also convenient at this point to address a subsidiary contention of the Malak Malak that the Committee erred by not addressing the existence or otherwise of the common spiritual affiliations of the Kamu local descent group in the manner required. The pithy contention was that the Committee 'made findings about the spiritual affiliations of each group rather than about those of their members'.

The approach to that aspect of fact finding was described by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 487-488 as follows: 
 
 'The task of the Commissioner is first to ascertain the relevant group to be investigated and then to determine whether the members of that group have the requisite common spiritual affiliation such that the group is as a result under a primary spiritual responsibility for the site and the land. A group necessarily comprises persons. Clearly it is not necessary to call each member of the group to give evidence to establish that they have the appropriate spiritual affiliation. It will be sufficient if the evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the Aboriginals who comprise the group have that affiliation.'

In my view, the Committee is not shown to have departed from the proper decision-making process or to have misunderstood its task. In accordance with what the Full Court then went on to indicate at 488, the Committee recognised that the common spiritual affiliations have to be possessed by the individuals who comprise the group. I do not read [100] of the Committee Report as indicating any departure from that process. Its decision was based upon the evidence of individual members of the Kamu, given at a number of sites. It clearly recognised that the Kamu comprise a number of individuals who are descendants of Mrs Pan Quee. In my view, its focus when making its findings on this aspect was properly upon the Aboriginals who comprise the Kamu local descent group which it found to exist.

The next two submissions of the Malak Malak can conveniently be dealt with together. They contended that the Committee erred in holding that both the Malak Malak and the Kamu hold 'joint primary spiritual responsibility' for the shared sites. And they contended that it erred in finding that the shared sites identify a 'shared area' or zone between the country of the Kamu and the country of the Malak Malak which is an area 'to which both groups have shared responsibilities and interests'.</text>

A Land Council is empowered by s 24(a) to compile and maintain a register of the names of persons who, in the opinion of the Land Council, are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the Aboriginal land in the area of the Land Council.

The distribution between those two categories was recognised by Brennan J in Meneling Station at 358 and 360; by Wilson and Brennan JJ in Re Toohey; Ex parte Stanton (1982) 44 ALR 94 ( Stanton ) at 100 and 104 respectively; and by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 479.

The issue has not been the subject of direct judicial determination, although Justice Toohey as the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in his Report in the Finniss River Land Claim in 1981 appears to have accepted at [100], [218], [220], [225] and [234] that there may be more than one group of traditional Aboriginal owners of a particular site or area of country. I do not consider the observations of Brennan J in Meneling Station at 356-360 support the contention of the Malak Malak. That case relevantly concerned s 50(3) of the ALRA.

<tocase>Re Toohey; Ex parte Stanton (1982) 44 ALR 94</tocase>
<text>The distribution between those two categories was recognised by Brennan J in Meneling Station at 358 and 360; by Wilson and Brennan JJ in Re Toohey; Ex parte Stanton (1982) 44 ALR 94 ( Stanton ) at 100 and 104 respectively; and by the Full Court in Northern Land Council v Olney at 479. It emerges clearly enough from provisions of the ALRA: see e.g. ss 23(1)(b), (c) and (e), and s 71. As the contentions of the Malak Malak point out, the Committee report does not explicitly refer to that broader category.

On the other hand, Wilson J (with whom Gibbs CJ and Mason J agreed) in Stanton at 98-99, when addressing the then appellants' complaint that their respective claims were not separately addressed on their merits, said: 
 
 'It is implicit in Mr Castan's submission that the Act contemplates that there may be more than one local descent group of Aboriginals who satisfy the description of traditional Aboriginal owners in respect of the same area of land. Such a construction of the Act would, in my opinion, be somewhat surprising, having regard to the definition of such traditional ownership, which requires the group, inter alia , to have "common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land, being affiliations that place the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for that site and for the land". It is difficult to contemplate two opposing groups, each of whom are placed at the same time under a primary spiritual responsibility for the same site and the same land. Certainly the claimants in this case each claimed traditional ownership to the exclusion of the other. In fact, the claims were not only competing, but mutually exclusive ...' 
 

The primary submission was rejected, so that those observations are not binding. It does not appear that the particular issue was argued in that case.

In my judgment, there is nothing in the ALRA which indicates that, in appropriate factual circumstances, there may not be more than one local descent group which can comprise the traditional Aboriginal owners of certain land. Indeed, if it be accepted that there is not, or not always, a sharp line defining the boundaries of country between neighbouring Aboriginal groups, it would seem to follow that there is in the 'overlap' country the prospect of each of those groups having common spiritual affiliations with that country or sites within it and having a primary spiritual responsibility for those sites.

I do not think that Stanton , upon which the Malak Malak rely, necessarily supports the contention. I have referred above to the relevant passage from the judgment of Wilson J (with whom Gibbs CJ and Mason J agreed). Reliance was also placed on the observations of Brennan J at 104 where his Honour said: 
 
 'Thirdly, it is submitted that the Commissioner ought to have ascertained whether the Maranunggu people on the one hand and the Kungarakany and Warai peoples on the other were all traditional Aboriginal owners of area 1 and part of area 2. Clearly enough, the facts upon which the two groups respectively relied were inconsistent with both groups being the traditional Aboriginal owners. The Commissioner noted that each of the two groups was asserting, to the exclusion of the other, traditional ownership of the land ... He found in favour of the Maranunggu claim. The Commissioner explicitly rejected the Kungarakany claim in respect of area 1 (para 192) and area 2 (para 207). There is no substance in this ground.'

It is apparent his Honour concluded that the relevant finding of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner that one of the competing groups was the traditional Aboriginal owners of the particular country in dispute was not infected with reviewable error. I do not think it excludes the possibility of there being two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners, or that in all circumstances where there are competing groups making exclusive claims there cannot as a matter of law be found to be two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners.

The so called exclusive claims of the Malak Malak and the Kamu in relation to particular sites in the Land Trust area must be seen in context. Although they were competing claims, the findings in the Toohey Report indicate that the basis of the Malak Malak claim to ownership of certain sites was passed on by Mrs Pan Quee on behalf of the Kamu. This is not a case where it had been found that the Kamu at no point in time had ownership of any of the disputed areas.

The NLC was required to fulfil its role under the ALRA, and established the Committee for the better performance of that function. The Committee concluded differently from the Toohey Report, that the Kamu continued to exist as a local descent group. It was then required to determine whether the Malak Malak or the Kamu or both satisfied the characteristics in the definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners'. There is nothing which, as a matter of law, obliged the Committee then to ignore its findings (which were positive in respect of the shared sites in the case of both the Malak Malak and the Kamu), or to find one or other group had a greater 'primary spiritual responsibility' than the other, or in some other way to conclude that despite both groups satisfying the definition in respect of particular sites one or other or neither of them should be so recognised. The consequences of their respective recognition as traditional Aboriginal owners in respect of particular sites is then simply governed by other provisions of the ALRA.

I do not accept that, by recognising two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners of particular sites, the determination of rights or their implementation would be frustrated. The NLC has certain consultation obligations with traditional Aboriginal owners, and with other Aboriginal persons in certain circumstances. The fact that the consent of the traditional Aboriginal owners is also required in respect of some proposed decisions (e.g. under ss 19(5)(a) and 46 (6)) will not be impeded, although practically it may be more difficult. In respect of any groups of traditional Aboriginal owners, s 77A provides how the consent may be taken to have been given in the case of intra-group disputes. But if as a fact (as here found) there are in respect of a particular site two groups of traditional Aboriginal owners, then the consent of each group will need to be obtained where such consent is required by the Act. That is, in my view, consistent with the beneficial purposes of the Act as it gives each of the groups of traditional Aboriginal owners the 'ownership' or control of decision-making through the processes the ALRA contemplates.</text>

<text>The definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners' accommodates, rather than excludes, such circumstances. If it were intended that, in respect of a particular site, there would be only one group of traditional Aboriginal owners, it would have been expressed to refer to 'the' local descent group rather than 'a' local descent group. In my view, the use of the indefinite article is intended to allow for more than one such group. The use of the definite article in subpar(a) of the definition before the word 'group' is then simply a reference back to the particular local descent group or groups found to exist and require that that particular group or groups have the characteristics specified. In addition, I consider that the use of the indefinite article before the words 'primary spiritual responsibility' also recognise that there may be more than one local descent group, otherwise that part of the definition would also refer to 'the' primary responsibility so as to exclude other local descent groups in respect of a particular site. See e.g. per Mason CJ and Deane J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 289.

To the extent that it is necessary, reliance for such a construction may be derived from s 23(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which provides for the singular to include the plural. Neither text of the definition of 'traditional Aboriginal owners', nor its context in the ALRA, indicates that a contrary intention to that construction emerges.</text>

<text>That construction is consistent with a number of reports of Aboriginal Land Commissioners under the ALRA. They are noted in Neate , Aboriginal Land Rights Law in the Northern Territory, Alternative Publishing Co-operative Ltd, Sydney, 1989 at Ch 3 fn 298. Since 1989, a number of similar reports have been made, including Justice Gray in the Jawoyn (Gimbat Area) Land Claim Report, 1995 (especially at [4.28]) and Justice Olney in the Wakaya/Alawarre Land Claim Report, 1990 (especially at [5.8]). I note, as senior counsel for the Malak Malak pointed out, both those reports concerned claimant groups who were not competing with each other. Moreover, that construction in my view is consistent with giving the ALRA a broad construction so as to give effect to the beneficial purpose for which it was intended: see e.g. R v Kearney; Ex parte Jurlama [1984] HCA 14 ; (1984) 158 CLR 426 at 433; and Northern Land Council v Olney at 479. It is unlikely that the ALRA was intended either to exclude altogether from the traditional ownership both local descent groups if (for example) there were found to be two local descent groups each with the specified characteristics in relation to a particular site, or alternatively to force a decision between competing local descent groups on some unspecified basis when reach was found to have the specified characteristics in relation to a particular site.</text>

<text>The balance of the Malak Malak contentions involve a more immediate attack upon factual findings of the Committee adopted by the NLC, including in some respects adopting the 'no evidence' ground of review available under s 5(1)(h) of the ADJR Act. In approaching these grounds, I have borne in mind the explanation of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 358-359 as to the interaction of subs 5(1)(e), (f) and (h) of the ADJR Act. I have also borne in mind that the High Court said in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39-41 about the scope of the grounds of review under subs 5(1)(e) and (2)(a) and (b) of the ADJR Act.</text>

<text>In respect of the site Jigirij, I am not persuaded that the Committee's findings involve reviewable error under the ADJR Act. I think there was evidence which could rationally support its conclusions. It had the benefit of seeing and hearing all the evidence, in particular the evidence of Mr Storer taken at the site. It had regard to the evidence before Justice Toohey and the findings in the Toohey Report. It is not shown to have misapprehended any evidence, or to have attributed to it a significance which it was not rationally capable of bearing. It is not my function to reconsider all the relevant evidence on a topic to see if I would have come to a different view of the facts: see per Gleeson CJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at [26] . It is my function to determine, in respect of contentions such as those referred to above, whether the Committee erred in a way which s 5(1) of the ADJR Act identifies as reviewable error. In my judgment, it did not.

The further contentions attacked the factual findings of the Committee, adopted by the NLC, that the Kamu have common spiritual affiliations to the sites Jebenyi, Ngulukmoenet and Kabamal, the Mt Hayward area in particular Wani-Alawun or Ngalyuwuy, or Jigirij.

Again, the parties' submissions have referred to the paucity (in the case of the Malak Malak) or the adequacy (in the case of the Kamu) of the evidence available to support the Committee's findings as well as evidence from Malak Malak persons about the relationship of the Malak Malak to those sites. In some instances, the Malak Malak evidence was not referred to by the Committee in its reasons, although of course (with the exception of the sites in respect of which only the Kamu were found to have common spiritual affiliations) the Committee concluded that they were traditional Aboriginal owners in respect of those sites.</text>
