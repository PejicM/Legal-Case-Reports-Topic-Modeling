<tocase>Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Another [1977] 16 ALR 43</tocase>
<text>18 The circumstances arising in these proceedings appear to be similar to those considered by the Full Federal Court in Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Another [1977] 16 ALR 43. In that matter a creditor had brought proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales claiming monetary sums from the defendants. While the case was pending, a sequestration order was made against one of the defendants to those proceedings. The litigation involved complex issues including those raised under defences and cross-claims and leave was sought under s 58(3)(b) of the Act to continue the proceedings. At 48 their Honours observed:
 
 It would seem that all of these issues would be better and more comprehensively dealt with by a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than could possibly be the case if Midland Credit were required to lodge a proof of debt in respect of its claim against Mr Allanson alone.

19 Similar considerations arise in this instance. The determination of the rights of Westpac will resolve any issue of ownership and of the existence of charges in respect of the identified properly.</text>

<tocase>Coleman v Lazy Days Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 55 FCR 297</tocase>
<text>20 The grant of the stay pursuant to s 52(3) of the Act made by Smith FM on 27 July 2007 does not alter the status of Mr Ollis as a bankrupt: see Coleman v Lazy Days Investments Pty Ltd (1994) 55 FCR 297 at 301. The sequestration order, having been made, remains in force. Accordingly s 58(3)(b) of the Act continues to apply rendering the current application for leave necessary.

21 A further issue raised is the effect of the orders sought if the restraining orders obtained by the New South Wales Crime Commission are set aside by the Court of Appeal. It is apparent that by virtue of the operation of s 58A of the Act, the property subject to the restraining orders does not form part of Mr Ollis' bankrupt estate whilst the restraining orders are in force. If the orders are set aside, the provisions of s 58(1) apply so that his property then becomes vested in the trustee. It is only at this point that Westpac would seek to join Mr Condon as a defendant in the proceedings. The Court does not need to consider this issue further as Mr Dibb has submitted that Mr Ollis has not in fact appealed against the making of the restraining order but only in respect of the making of a proceedings assessment order.

22 The Court is satisfied from the evidence before it that leave under s 58(3)(b)of the Act is required to enable Westpac to proceed with the adjudication of its claim against Mr Ollis and others and that the grant of leave would not be contrary to the purpose of the Act.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy .

<tocase>Re McMaster; Ex parte McMaster (1991) 33 FCR 70</tocase>
<text>14 The term 'in respect of' as it appears in s 58(3)(b) of the Act has been considered in Re McMaster; Ex parte McMaster (1991) 33 FCR 70 at 72 and in Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co Ltd v Reilly [1941] VLR 110 at 111. Each of those authorities referred to the wide construction which is to be given to such words ' in respect of' as contained in s 58(3)(b) of the Act.

15 In Re McMaster 33 FCR 72-73, Heerey J referred to the considerations which must be addressed by the Court when considering such an application. He stated:
 
 The modern bankruptcy law serves three purposes. The first is to ensure that the assets of the bankrupt are distributed rateably among creditors. The second, which is interrelated with the first, is to ensure that one creditor does not obtain an undue advantage over other creditors. The third is to bring about the discharge of the debtor from future liability for his existing debts, so that the debtor may start afresh: see Storey v Lane (supra) (at 556).

16 Counsel for Mr Ollis submitted that the continuation of the proceedings would place Westpac in a more advantageous position relative to other creditors, because Westpac sought declarations that Mr Ollis held certain property or interest in property on trust for Westpac and alternatively a declaration that property and interests in property were subject to a charge in favour of Westpac.

17 Despite such circumstances, the Court considers that the proceedings would merely determine the rights of the parties in relation to the property or property interests and determine ownership thereof. The determination would not provide Westpac with any privilege or preference. Accordingly, the submission is rejected.</text>
