<text>The reasonable observer's answer would be the same if the matter is approached more broadly than by way of the confines of offer and acceptance. While offer and acceptance may be the primary mode of ascertaining the existence of an agreement, in an appropriate case, including where there is no readily identifiable offer and acceptance, a court may look at the matter more broadly by asking whether, objectively and having regard to the totality of the dealings between the parties, they should be considered to have entered into a contractual relationship without inquiring too closely into the formalities of offer and acceptance: see Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9th ed, LexisNexis, 2008) at 97 and Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 at 79-83. For the reasons given at [8], the objective observer would not conclude that the fax enabled Mr Furman's approval alone to bring a concluded agreement into existence.</text>
