<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>16 However, in my view, the Tribunal did not approach the ultimate issue in the way I described the task in my earlier decision and in accordance with the approach necessary in evaluating whether the appellant was a fit and proper person. In determining whether a person is a fit and proper person the enquiry is directed not only to whether improper conduct has occurred, but whether it is likely to occur again, and whether the community will have confidence that it will not occur. This will involve an evaluation of character and reputation: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 , 380 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The Tribunal should have considered and, more importantly, evaluated all the material which was raised as to 'special circumstances' in the context of a separate and ultimate enquiry of whether the appellant, at the time of the Tribunal's decision, was the prescribed fit and proper person.

17 In my view, the Tribunal did not undertake this task in the passages referred to above where it purported to consider the ultimate issue. To say, for example, as the Tribunal did, the appellant's explanations 'showed a lack of understanding of the reason for lodgement' of tax returns may be accepted, but this needs to be placed in the context of the evidence as to his health and general circumstances at the time, and in the context of the evaluation referred to in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal 170 CLR 321. While the Tribunal had previously accepted the appellant's medical condition proved debilitating over the years, the required evaluation necessarily involves looking at both past conduct and likelihood of future conduct, and this evaluation was simply missing from the Tribunal's analysis. The general references back to evidence and principles of law did not equate to an evaluation of the evidence in this context of the ultimate issue.

18 While the main criticism of the reasoning of the Tribunal is the lack of evaluation, there are references made in the reasoning that indicate a failure to focus on all the relevant circumstances up to the Tribunal hearing date. The Tribunal specifically referred to matters which occurred many years ago. There was a reference to the lodgement rate ('at least in the 2002 year' (at [156] of the Tribunal's decision)), correspondence on 7 July 2004 (at [159]), and conduct in 2003 (at [159]). No attempt was made to put these events in context, nor to consider them in the context of later events and circumstances.

19 As I have indicated, I propose to order the appeal be allowed.</text>

<text>10 In considering the approach of the Tribunal, the Tribunal's reasons must be read as a whole and fairly. I accept that I should not be concerned with looseness of language, nor review the Tribunal's reasons with an 'eye keenly attuned to the perception of error': Politis v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 108 , 111; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 322 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 , 287.</text>

<tocase>Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 248 ALR 390</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/31.html</AustLII>
<text>7 From the outset I acknowledge that the Tribunal did discuss the ultimate issue of whether the applicant was the prescribed fit and proper person. Further, the Tribunal did carefully consider the appropriate date at which it needed to consider the question before it, and the issue of 'special circumstances'. On the question of the appropriate date, the Tribunal dealt with the two possibilities separately (perhaps unnecessarily), and made findings for each accordingly. We now have the advantage of the decision in Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 248 ALR 390 , concerning the relevant time of assessment. As to the question of 'special circumstances', this was a matter of evaluation and factual analysis, upon which the Tribunal was entitled to make its 'factual classification' in the way it did: see Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12 ; (2001) 202 CLR 439 , 477-78 at [108] per Hayne J. I find no error of law in the way the Tribunal approached these matters.</text>

<tocase>Statham v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 228</tocase>
<text>21 The appellant desired that I determine the ultimate issue myself. The appellant relied on the approach taken in Statham v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 228. The question for determination in Statham was strikingly different from the question whether a person is the prescribed fit and proper person. As I have said, the determination of this issue involves an evaluation of many factors. Such an evaluation is quite different from determining the application of s 25(1) or s 26(a) of the Act to undisputed facts as was the case in Statham . To proceed in the way now pressed by the appellant would require an assessment of the appellant, and I have not had the advantage of seeing him in the witness box, being able to ask questions of him, or to make a proper evaluation of the type the relevant provisions require.

22 The appellant pressed that I could receive further evidence from the appellant, and then determine the matter of whether he is the prescribed fit and proper person. It was submitted that it was convenient and appropriate that I make whatever further findings of fact necessary, and take into account any further evidence of the appellant.

23 The appellant further contended that he would not be able to afford legal representation should the matter be remitted, and there would be an unacceptable delay if the matter were remitted.

28 Despite the history of this proceeding, in my view, it would not be convenient or appropriate for the Court to finally dispose of the matter in accordance with the power under ss 44(4) , 44 (5), (7) and (8) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) and the approach taken in Statham 20 ATR 228. I propose to make an order for remittal to the Tribunal.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.
