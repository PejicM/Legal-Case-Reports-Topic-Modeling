<tocase>Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager [1984] VR 483</tocase>
<text>12 I do, however, consider that there was a considerable loss of time, inconvenience to the parties and the Court, and a wilful disregard to established law in the attempts to re-open the case (other than on the limited basis permitted) and in the application for a restraining order against Saxbys see generally Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401; Ugly Tribe Company Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 ; Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager [1984] VR 483 at 502.

29 I do not accept on the current material that the application to restrain Saxbys was necessarily to intimidate or harass Saxbys or its clients, although I do accept that there was no basis to support the legitimacy of such motion to disqualify. The allegations made against Saxbys were unsuccessful. In my view they were clearly unmeritorious, and to the extent possible, Saxbys should not be out of pocket see generally Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401; Ugly Tribe Company Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 ; Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager [1984] VR 483 at 502.</text>

<tocase>Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/28.html</AustLII>
<text>7 The plaintiffs requested that Mr Fisher be ordered to pay the costs incurred in relation to the hearings after the conclusion of the hearing on 11 July 2007 (on the principles set out in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178) because:
 
 (1) a considerable portion of time was wasted on the application to remove Saxbys which application was without merit;
 (2) the application for leave to reopen APM's case was seeking an indulgence and was without merit.

10 Further, I am not satisfied that the interests of justice require an order to be made against Mr Fisher where costs can be accommodated in accordance with the statutory regime or as part of the costs in the winding up see generally Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 and Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson [1994] QB 179 at 191-192 per Balcombe LJ.</text>

<tocase>White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169</tocase>
<text>8 It was contended that Mr Fisher's conduct was unreasonable in the sense used by Goldberg J in White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169 in that:
 
 (1) the applications were hopeless; 
 (2) Mr Fisher conducted and managed the proceeding in disregard of any proper consideration of the prospects of success; and 
 (3) no practitioner who was reasonably well-informed and competent would have so acted.

9 The application by APM to re-open was permitted on a limited basis, although the application by APM to remove Saxbys was unsuccessful. However, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate in the context of the applications made on behalf of APM or in the conduct of the proceedings generally, that I should make a cost order directly against Mr Fisher. I do not consider that Mr Fisher's own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable, or even that if the application against Saxbys was obviously without merit, that a costs order against Mr Fisher would be appropriate. I appreciate that Mr Fisher (as the director of APM) was granted leave to appeal the decision of Registrar Musset, but the hearing was to be treated de novo to consider the solvency of APM.</text>
