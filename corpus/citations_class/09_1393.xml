<tocase>Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1583</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1583.html</AustLII>
<text>The unjustified threats Claim will turn on the resolution of the other issues referred to in [6] and [7] above. That Claim was adjourned on 21 October 2008 because Mr Ogilvie, the principal witness to be called by Flameglow in support of that Claim, was ill and could not attend Court when the hearing of the other liability issues took place. The orders made on that occasion and the reasons for them are to be found in Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1583. In addition, Flameglow did not participate to any real extent in the hearing before me. Its participation was confined to seeking to have its unjustified threats claim adjourned and to seeking to read an affidavit sworn by Mr Ogilvie, which I rejected.

The application for the Patent was filed on 9 February 1990. At that time, the provisions of the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) ( the 1952 Act ) were in force.

The Patent was granted on 20 July 1992.</text>

<tocase>Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/59.html</AustLII>
<text>The terms of s 100(1)(e) of the 1952 Act did not permit recourse to the type of information covered by s 7(3) of the 1990 Act (see Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [15] [16] (pp 421 422). Those terms restricted the analysis to a consideration of the common general knowledge before the priority date.

The standard for the assessment of obviousness or inventive step was not otherwise different.

In the present case, Garth Living and Hotpoint relied upon the HECLA heater and other patents "... for the purposes of s 7(3) of the Act ...".

It is clear that, at least to some extent, those parties are relying upon s 7(3) of the 1990 Act in support of this ground of revocation. They seek to rely upon information which did not form part of the common general knowledge but which could potentially be taken into account under s 7(3). In my judgment, they are not permitted to do so for the reason which I have noted at [132] above.

Even if the prior art relied upon by Garth Living and Hotpoint could be taken into account, there is no evidence that would justify a finding that the claimed invention was obvious in light of that prior art. The evidence tendered by Garth Living and Hotpoint falls well short of the test expounded in Aktiebolaget Hassle [2002] HCA 59 ; 212 CLR 411 at [53] [54] (pp 433 434) where Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in their joint judgment, after addressing the question of whether or not the experiments were part of the asserted inventive step or simply of a routine character which would inevitably have been attempted as a matter of course, said (at [53] [54] (pp 433 434)): That way of approaching the matter has an affinity with the reformulation of the "Cripps question" by Graham J in Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboratories Ltd [[1970] RPC 157]. This Court had been referred to Olin in the argument in Wellcome Foundation [(1981) [1981] HCA 12 ; 148 CLR 262 at 267. See also Washex Machinery Corporation v Roy Burton &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1974) 49 ALJR 12 at 16]. Graham J had posed the question [ Olin Mathieson [1970] RPC 157 at 187-188. The approach taken in Olin appears now to be disfavoured by the English Court of Appeal: Pharmacia Corporation v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2002] RPC 775 at 819-820, but it still has support in the English profession: Cole, "Inventive Step: Meaning of the EPO Problem and Solution Approach, and Implications for the United Kingdom -- Part II" [1998] European Intellectual Property Review 267 , at p 270]: 
 
 
 
 "Would the notional research group at the relevant date, in all the circumstances, which include a knowledge of all the relevant prior art and of the facts of the nature and success of chlorpromazine, directly be led as a matter of course to try the CF3 substitution in the '2' position in place of the C1 atom in chlorpromazine or in any other body which, apart from the CF3 substitution, has the other characteristics of the formula of claim 1, in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to or better drug than chlorpromazine or a body useful for any other purpose?" (Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That approach should be accepted. 
 
 
 
 
 The reasoning of the primary judge 
 
 Lehane J did not treat "routine" in that way. He erred by giving it an operation more favourable to Alphapharm's case. What his Honour did was in line with the position which now apparently obtains in England, that "all of the courses of action which present themselves without the exercise of invention are obvious" [ Pharmacia Corporation v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2002] RPC 775 at 818]. His Honour did not assess what was said by the expert witnesses concerning the procedures they would have followed by making findings whether they would have been led directly as a matter of course to pursue one avenue in the expectation that it might well produce the claimed compound. 
 
This ground of revocation has not been made out. 
 Fair Basis

Section 40(3) of the 1990 Act requires that the claims of the Patent be fairly based on the matter described in the specification. This is substantially the same requirement as was laid down by s 40 of the 1952 Act.</text>

<text>In his text Patents for Inventions (5 th ed, Stevens, 1983) Blanco White said (at 4-102) (p 53): 
 
 The test for lack of novelty is essentially the same as the test for infringement; that is to say, a prior use will invalidate a claim ... if it was such that it would infringe that claim if carried out after the grant of the patent concerned; while a prior disclosure will invalidate if it contains a clear description of, or clear instructions to do or make, something that would infringe if carried out after grant. 
 

 
This formulation has been applied in Australia (see Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 ; (2008) 76 IPR 618 at [157] (p 657) (per Lindgren J)).

In assessing novelty, each alleged anticipation must be considered separately. Each alleged anticipation must disclose each and every one of the essential integers of a claim or claims under consideration.</text>

<text>In Bristol-Myers Squibb Co v FH Faulding &amp; Co Ltd [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 , Black CJ and Lehane J, in a joint judgment, after reviewing several relevant authorities at [64] [66] (pp 547 548), at [67] (pp 548 549) said: 
 
 What all those authorities contemplate, in our view, is that a prior publication, if it is to destroy novelty, must give a direction or make a recommendation or suggestion which will result, if the skilled reader follows it, in the claimed invention. A direction, recommendation or suggestion may often, of course, be implicit in what is described and commonly the only question may be whether the publication describes with sufficient clarity the claimed invention or, in the case of a combination, each integer of it.</text>

<tocase>General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre &amp; Rubber Co Ltd (1971) 1A IPR 121, [1972] RPC 457</tocase>
<text>The United Kingdom Court of Appeal in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre &amp; Rubber Co Ltd (1971) 1A IPR 121, [1972] RPC 457 at 485 486 held that, if the prior inventor's publication contains a clear description of, or clear instructions to do or make, something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty. In that sense, it will have been anticipated. It is a question of whether or not the prior inventor's publication would render the later effort an infringement of the patentee's claim, on the assumption that the patentee's patent is valid. The Court of Appeal held ([1972] RPC at 486): 
 
 If, on the other hand, the prior publication contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner which would infringe the patentee's claim, but would be at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so, the patentee's claim will not have been anticipated, although it may fail on the ground of obviousness. To anticipate the patentee's claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented: Flour Oxidising Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd ((1908) 25 RPC 428 at 457, line 34, approved in BTH Co Ltd v Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co Ltd (1928) 45 RPC 1 at 24, line 1). A signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee's invention will not suffice. The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee.</text>

<text>These propositions were confirmed by the Full Court in ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v The Lubrizol Corporation Inc (2000) 106 FCR 214 at [22] [23] (p 224), where the Court said: 
 
 Applicable statutory regime 
 
 The patent was granted under the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) (the 1952 Act). The 1952 Act has been repealed and the legislation now in force is the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the 1990 Act). Section 233 of the 1990 Act provides: 
 
 
 
 "(1) Subject to this Chapter and the Regulations, this Act applies in relation to a standard patent or a petty patent granted under the 1952 Act as if the patent had been granted under this Act. 
 ... 
 (4) Objection cannot be taken to a patent mentioned in subsection (1), and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the patent under the 1952 Act." 
 
 
 
 It follows that the patent can only be revoked under the 1990 Act, and only on a ground of invalidity which is provided by that Act and would also have been available under the 1952 Act. And where the ground of invalidity under the 1952 Act is narrower than the corresponding ground under the 1990 Act, the patentee has the benefit of the narrower ground. That follows from the decision of the Full Court in NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 404 ; (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 253-254.

Section 234(2) and s 234(5) are also relevant to the cross-claimants' claims that the Patent is invalid and should be revoked.

These statements were expressly approved by the Full Court in ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd 106 FCR 214 at [51] (p 230).</text>

<text>In the present case, there is no dispute amongst the parties as to the principles of construction to be applied to the Patent. All parties referred me to the joint judgment of the Full Court in Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 90 ; (2005) 222 ALR 155 , (2005) 65 IPR 86 , (2005) AIPC 92-098 at [67] . Reliance was also placed by some of the respondents upon the statements made at [68] in the same case. Those paragraphs are in the following terms: There is no real dispute between the parties as to the principles of construction to be applied in this matter although there is some difference in emphasis. It suffices for present purposes to refer to the following: 
 
 
 (i) the proper construction of a specification is a matter of law: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400;
 (ii) a patent specification should be given a purposive, not a purely literal, construction: Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 ; [2000] FCA 890 at [81] ( Flexible Steel Lacing ); and it is not to be read in the abstract but is to be construed in the light of the common general knowledge and the art before the priority date: Kimberley-Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 1 ; 177 ALR 460 ; 50 IPR 513 ; [2001] HCA 8 at [24] ;
 (iii) the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning which the normal person skilled in the art would attach to them, having regard to his or her own general knowledge and to what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd at 391;
 (iv) while the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification, although terms in the claim which are unclear may be defined by reference to the body of the specification: Kimberley-Clark v Arico at [15]; Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1961] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 at 478; the body of a specification cannot be used to change a clear claim for one subject matter into a claim for another and different subject matter: Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd [1938] 4 All ER 221 at 224 5 ; (1938) 56 RPC 23 at 39;
 (v) experts can give evidence on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings to be given by skilled addressees to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Lt d [1994] FCA 1529 ; (1994) 30 IPR 479 at 485 6 ( Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd ); the court is to place itself in the position of some person acquainted with the surrounding circumstances as to the state of the art and manufacture at the time ( Kimberley-Clark v Arico at [24]); and
 (vi) it is for the court, not for any witness however expert, to construe the specification; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd at 485 6. 
 
 
 We may add that the area of invention with which this proceeding is concerned is a particularly narrow one. It is one in which business rivals are striving to invent around the patented inventions of others and within narrow regulatory limits. In such a context it is, in our view, important to recognise that claims made for an invention may need to be formulated narrowly to avoid invalidity. While accepting the primacy of purposive construction in interpreting patents, such a construction may well provide little by way of illumination where, as here, the inventive context is a cramped one. It is not appropriate to take a claim carefully drawn to avoid invalidity and then permit a wider "purposive" construction of it for infringement purposes: Grove Hill Pty Ltd v Great Western Corp Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 257 ; [2002] FCAFC 183 at [311] .

In Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC (No 2) [2006] FCA 1787 ; (2006) 71 IPR 46 at [62] [64] (pp 61 62), Young J distilled from a number of authorities a set of principles which his Honour held should ordinarily guide the construction of patents. The observations which his Honour made in that case are reminiscent of the statements made by the Full Court in Jupiters [2005] FCAFC 90 ; 222 ALR 155 , 65 IPR 86 , AIPC 92-098 and need not be set out in full here. However, I am content to adopt and apply what his Honour said, which, to some extent, helpfully adds to the statements of principle made by the Full Court in Jupiters [2005] FCAFC 90 ; 222 ALR 155 , 65 IPR 86 , AIPC 92-098.</text>

<text>These observations made by his Honour were cited with approval by the High Court in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [69] (pp 300 301).

After the description of the preferred embodiments set out in the Patent, there is a description of an embodiment of the invention by reference to accompanying schematic drawings. This description is to be found between line 5 on p 4 and line 20 on p 9 of the Patent. Eight drawings are depicted in the schematic drawings forming part of the Patent. The Claims

The Patent contains 20 Claims which define the invention. These are found on pp 10 12 of the Patent. There are two independent Claims (Claims 1 and 15). As is usually the case, each of the independent Claims is followed by several dependent Claims which become progressively narrower as additional features or limitations are added to the invention.

Fair basis involves a comparison between the claims made in the Patent and what is disclosed in the specification in order to determine whether there is a "real and reasonably clear disclosure" of the invention claimed, or whether the claims "travel beyond" the invention described (see Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; 217 CLR 274 at [57] (p 295), [69] (p 300) and [83] (p 306) (per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ)). I cannot see how, in the present case, the claims travel beyond the invention which has been described in the specification.

Garth Living and Hotpoint seemed to be advancing this ground as a means of dealing with Bitech's construction of the Patent. Having regard to the construction which I have placed upon Claim 1, I do not think there is any room for a challenge based upon the absence of fair basis. This ground must be rejected.

For the above reasons, Bitech's Application must be dismissed as must the Cross-Claims for a declaration of invalidity in respect of the Patent and for revocation of the Patent. I will make orders accordingly.</text>

<text>In Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 235, Aickin J said: 
 
 The basic test for anticipation or want of novelty is the same as that for infringement and generally one can properly ask oneself whether the alleged anticipation would, if the patent were valid, constitute an infringement (see, e.g., Harwood v. Great Northern Railway Co. [(1865) [1865] EngR 708 ; 11 H.L.C. 654 , at p. 681 [1865] EngR 708 ; [11 E.R. 1488 , at pp. 1498-1499]). Here no prior object and no object according to a prior document involved or incorporated all the integers of any one of the claims and could therefore possibly constitute an infringement. Accordingly I am satisfied that the objection of want of novelty has not been made out.

This test is applicable to the circumstance where the alleged anticipation resides in a prior apparatus that would, if it contained all of the necessary integers, fall within the scope of the claims. Therefore, this test would directly apply to the alleged anticipation constituted in the present case by the HECLA heater.</text>

<tocase>Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/9.html</AustLII>
<text>The case advanced by Garth Living and Hotpoint in support of the proposition that the relevant claims in the Patent lacked novelty was rather loosely put in the sense that, as I understood it, it was impermissibly founded upon selectively aggregating individual items of information in order to present a mosaic or an entire picture favourable to those parties' case for revocation. This type of approach was rejected by the High Court in Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 292 293.

Bitech submitted that: 
 
 ... Neither the HECLA heater nor the apparatus described in any of the three prior patent specifications incorporates the feature of "screen means" which is capable of both diffusely transmitting light from a flame effect means and reflecting light from a fuel means so that simulated flames appear to emanate between the fuel means and an image of the latter means reflected on the screen means. This being an essential integer of Claim 1, upon which the other relevant claims are dependant, it is not necessary to go further.

That submission was made good by my inspection of the HECLA heater and by a careful consideration of the prior patent specifications. The HECLA heater contains a very primitive attempt to simulate flames and fuel and plainly goes nowhere near the essential integers of the Patent referred to in Bitech's submission. The prior patent specifications do not provide clear and unmistakeable directions to construct an apparatus which incorporates the feature of the screen means which was the subject of Bitech's submission extracted at [126] above. Garth Living and Hotpoint were unable to present a coherent and persuasive submission which identified such clear and unmistakable directions. The evidence of Professors Nugent and Monro did not assist in that endeavour.

Further, the generalised assertions made by Professors Nugent and Monro to the effect that the existence of the HECLA heater and Australian Patent Application No 3567/66 was part of the common general knowledge before the priority date of the Patent are not persuasive. The knowledge must be available to all in the relevant trade and must be treated as part of a general body of knowledge in that trade (see Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company 144 CLR at 292). Patent specifications do not become part of the common general knowledge merely by reason of their publication: Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company 144 CLR at 294 295.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1982/45.html</AustLII>
<text>In deciding whether a patent has been infringed, the Court is obliged to adopt a common sense construction of the claims in the patent, having regard to the prior knowledge as at the priority date, and, having done so, to determine whether the alleged infringer has taken all of the essential features or integers of the patentee's claims as determined by that construction ( Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 45 ; (1982) 59 FLR 37 at 40 41 [1982] FCA 45 ; , (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 475).

The Patent is for an invention entitled "Apparatus for Simulating Flames". It was granted on 20 July 1992 on an application filed on 9 February 1990 as a Convention Application pursuant to Pt XVI of the 1952 Act. It claims priority from the filing of two basic applications in the United Kingdom on 10 February 1989 and on 15 September 1989 respectively. The Description

The specification commences with a description of the nature of the invention and some relevant background. The first two paragraphs of that description, which appear between lines 3 and 16 on p 1a of the Patent, are in the following terms: 
 
 This invention relates to apparatus for simulating flames. The apparatus may be part of, or embodied in a heating appliance (such as an electric or gas fire) in order to create the impression of flames due to combusting fuel.
 Many attempts have been made in the past to simulate combusting fuel. The prior art devices often included some means intended to represent flickering flames but they lacked realism. Moreover, when an appliance having such an effect is seen from day to day, it becomes less convincing with the passage of time. In many prior art devices, dust and dirt can also build up on various surfaces so that any initially pleasing effect is spoilt thereby detracting from any realism. At least the preferred embodiments of the invention seek to solve these problems.</text>

 The circumstance that something is a requirement for the best method of performing an invention does not make it necessarily a requirement for all claims; likewise, the circumstance that material is part of the description of the invention does not mean that it must be included as an integer of each claim.

Those paragraphs are in the following terms: There is no real dispute between the parties as to the principles of construction to be applied in this matter although there is some difference in emphasis. It suffices for present purposes to refer to the following: 
 
 
 (i) the proper construction of a specification is a matter of law: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400;
 (ii) a patent specification should be given a purposive, not a purely literal, construction: Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 ; [2000] FCA 890 at [81] ( Flexible Steel Lacing ); and it is not to be read in the abstract but is to be construed in the light of the common general knowledge and the art before the priority date: Kimberley-Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 1 ; 177 ALR 460 ; 50 IPR 513 ; [2001] HCA 8 at [24] ;
 (iii) the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning which the normal person skilled in the art would attach to them, having regard to his or her own general knowledge and to what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd at 391;
 (iv) while the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification, although terms in the claim which are unclear may be defined by reference to the body of the specification: Kimberley-Clark v Arico at [15]; Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1961] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 at 478; the body of a specification cannot be used to change a clear claim for one subject matter into a claim for another and different subject matter: Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd [1938] 4 All ER 221 at 224 5 ; (1938) 56 RPC 23 at 39;
 (v) experts can give evidence on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings to be given by skilled addressees to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Lt d [1994] FCA 1529 ; (1994) 30 IPR 479 at 485 6 ( Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd ); the court is to place itself in the position of some person acquainted with the surrounding circumstances as to the state of the art and manufacture at the time ( Kimberley-Clark v Arico at [24]); and
 (vi) it is for the court, not for any witness however expert, to construe the specification; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd at 485 6. 
 
 
 We may add that the area of invention with which this proceeding is concerned is a particularly narrow one. It is one in which business rivals are striving to invent around the patented inventions of others and within narrow regulatory limits. In such a context it is, in our view, important to recognise that claims made for an invention may need to be formulated narrowly to avoid invalidity. While accepting the primacy of purposive construction in interpreting patents, such a construction may well provide little by way of illumination where, as here, the inventive context is a cramped one. It is not appropriate to take a claim carefully drawn to avoid invalidity and then permit a wider "purposive" construction of it for infringement purposes: Grove Hill Pty Ltd v Great Western Corp Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 257 ; [2002] FCAFC 183 at [311] .

In Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1961] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 , a Full Court of the High Court (Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ), said (at 609): 
 
 Most of the argument before us centred upon the construction of the specification and, as in every patent case, it is necessary to determine from it what exactly is the invention it describes and for which a monopoly is claimed, before proceeding to consider objections to the validity of particular claims: Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd. v. Lissen Ltd [(1938) 56 RPC 23 , at p 39].

At 610, the Court said: 
 
 If it is impossible to ascertain what the invention is from a fair reading of the specification as a whole, that, of course, is an end of the matter. But this objection is not established by reading the specification in the abstract. It must be construed in the light of the common knowledge in the art before the priority date. The general principles governing the construction of specifications are well known, and no lengthy reference to them is necessary. It is, however, fitting that we remind ourselves of the criterion to be applied when it is said that a specification is ambiguous. For, as the Chief Justice pointed out in Martin v. Scribal [(1954) [1954] HCA 48 ; 92 CLR 17 , at p 59], referring to Lord Parker's remarks in National Colour Kinematograph Co. Ltd. v. Bioschemes Ltd [(1915) 32 RPC 256] , we are not construing a written instrument operating inter partes, but a public instrument which must, if it is to be valid, define a monopoly in such a way that it is not reasonably capable of being misunderstood. Nevertheless, it is to be remembered that any purely verbal or grammatical question that can be resolved according to ordinary rules for the construction of written documents, does not, once it has been resolved, leave uncertain the ambit of the monopoly claimed (see Kauzal v. Lee [(1936) [1936] HCA 39 ; 58 CLR 670 , at p 685]). The specification must be read as a whole. But it is a whole made up of several parts, and those parts have different functions. Courts have often insisted that it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document.

The Court then moved to consider in some detail the patent in dispute in that case. After setting out the objects of that patent, the Court said (at 612): 
 
 At this point in a modern specification one might expect to find a general description of what the inventor asserts his invention consists of, commonly called a "consistory clause". This, however, is not an essential part of the body of a specification. It is not required by the Act. Its purpose may be quite well met by the claims themselves: United Shoe Machinery Corporation's Application [(1939) 57 RPC 71]. Indeed, the usual practice in England is now to use in the consistory clause the wording of the broadest of the claims: see Mr. Blanco White's book, Patents for Inventions 2nd ed. (1955) p. 34n. The present Australian Act expressly requires the claim or claims to define the invention: s. 40. In a patent for a combination, such as this is, the most important function of the body of the specification is to show what are the mechanical means which, operating together, produce the result claimed; and how they so operate.</text>
