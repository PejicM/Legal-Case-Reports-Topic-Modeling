<text>11) In all therefore, the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant had suffered any Convention related harm, nor did it accept that there was a real chance of Convention related harm befalling the applicant if he were to return to China in the reasonably foreseeable future. On this basis, the Tribunal found the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of Convention related persecution, and affirmed the decision under review. 
 
 (Federal Magistrate's Court Book references omitted). 
9 At the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the decision of the Tribunal, the applicant was represented by Mr J Gormly of Counsel, and the Minister was represented by Mr T Reilly of Counsel. Counsel for the appellant was granted leave to file an amended application, in which the appellant claimed that the Tribunal did not comply with s 424A of the Act as the letter sent to the applicant by the Tribunal pursuant to that section was sent after the Tribunal hearing.
 
10 It was contended for the appellant, on the basis of the remarks made in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 ; [2007] HCA 26 ( SZBYR ) at [17]-[19], that s 424A required a letter to be sent prior to any Tribunal hearing.
 
11 Nicholls FM dismissed this argument for two reasons. First, his Honour held that s 424A was not to be so construed, holding that SZBYR had not overturned comments in SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2005) 228 CLR 294 ; [2005] HCA 24 ( SAAP ) indicating that s 424A could be complied with after the Tribunal hearing. Secondly, his Honour accepted the submission on behalf of the Minister that s 424A(1) was not engaged by any material relied on by the appellant, given what was said about the meaning of "information" in SZBYR , at [17]-[18].</text>

 ... does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.</text>

<text>18 Subsequent to the decision by Nicholls FM, a Full Court of the Federal Court has confirmed that s 424A is not limited to compliance before a Tribunal hearing: SZKLG v MIAC (2007) 164 FCR 578 ; [2007] FCAFC 198 at [34] - [36] . The point rejected by the Full Court in that case was argued by the same counsel who appeared for the appellant before Nicholls FM.

19 It follows that Ground 4 must fail.

20 It is for these reasons that, on 20 May 2008, I made the orders dismissing the appeal and ordering the appellant pay the respondents' costs to be taxed, if not agreed.
 I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender .

<text>1 On 20 May 2008, I dismissed an appeal from a judgment of Nicholls FM in SZKNB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 2012.

2 Nicholls FM, on 10 December 2007, dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal), which had been signed on 22 March 2007 and handed down on 23 March 2007, affirming a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa.

3 I ordered that the appeal be dismissed; the appellant pay the respondents' costs to be taxed, if not agreed, and I indicated that I would deliver reasons for the making of those orders at a later date. These are those reasons.</text>
