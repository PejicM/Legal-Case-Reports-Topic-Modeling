<tocase>Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1039.html</AustLII>
<text>But doubt as to whether this Court's jurisdiction has been properly invoked need not presently be resolved because the power to transfer a proceeding exists even where a question arises as to jurisdiction: cf Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039. Tamberlin J there concluded: 
 [21] I note that during argument as to whether the Court ought to transfer the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court, a question arose as to whether this Court has power to remit a "proceeding" to the Federal Magistrates Court where this Court does not have jurisdiction due to the absence of a federal "matter". In my view, the expression "proceeding" in s 32AB of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is distinct from the expression "matter" (as used in s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)) and is sufficiently wide to encompass the present dispute between the parties. I therefore consider that the Court has power to, and should, transfer the proceeding notwithstanding any doubt which may exist as to its jurisdiction to hear and determine the application.

Having considered the factors set forth in s 32AB(6), O 82 r 7, and the submissions made both in writing and orally, it is considered that the present proceeding should be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. What further orders or directions as that Court may hereafter make is a matter for that Court to determine. No submission was advanced that a referral of a proceeding pursuant to s 32AB to the Federal Magistrates Court can in any way constrain the manner in which that Court thereafter itself deals with the proceeding.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/150.html</AustLII>
<text>The power conferred by s 32AB has been exercised on a number of occasions and in diverse situations. In Garage Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Engineering Software Solutions Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 361 , McKerracher J transferred a proceeding alleging a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). His Honour considered that the proceeding involved a claim for a moderate amount and that it was likely that it could be dealt with more expeditiously and less formally in the Federal Magistrates Court. See also Kurniadi v Loh [2002] FCA 1021 , 193 ALR 253. A further instance is provided by Ozluk v Australian Turkish &amp; Kurdish Community Services Co-Operative Ltd [2008] FCA 352 where Graham J transferred an application brought pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). See also Beetham v Cortra Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 150. In Melville v Macquarie University [2006] FCA 1761 Madgwick J transferred an application brought under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) for unlawful termination of employment. See also Sheikholeslami v University of New South Wales [2006] FCA 712 ; Rixon v Business Parcell Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969.

<tocase>Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard [1999] NSWCA 422 , 47 NSWLR 735</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/1999/422.html</AustLII>
<text>For present purposes it may be accepted that each of these issues may well be raised during the course of the proceeding. None of the " complicated points ", however, are such that they cannot be resolved by a Federal Magistrate. As was properly recognised by Counsel for the Applicant, assistance has been provided by other courts as to the manner in which at least some of the statutory provisions in question are to be applied: e.g. Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard [1999] NSWCA 422 , 47 NSWLR 735. But there remain difficult issues of statutory construction which are yet to be resolved &#8212; or so it was contended by the Applicant. There was said to be " contrary views " expressed by different superior courts. But the Federal Magistrates Court, it should be recognised, routinely confronts and has to interpret a myriad of complex statutory provisions and routinely has to resolve difficult questions of evidence and law. That quite frequently is the nature of the jurisdiction entrusted to that Court.

Not surprisingly, Counsel for the Applicant did not refer in his outline of written submissions to the Defence pleading such further facts as: the non-disclosure of convictions for offences other than for " not wearing a seatbelt "; the non-disclosure of convictions for driving with more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol; and the driving of the vehicle the subject of the claim by a driver " under the influence of intoxicating liquor ". 
It is envisaged by the insurer at least that it will be necessary to issue subpoenas and to obtain discovery. The insurer further contends that a significant aspect of its case will be the question as to whether liability can be denied simply upon the basis that the driver of the vehicle was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The insurer envisages that relevant to that part of its case there will be the need to call evidence from police officers, ambulance officers and possibly evidence from those in the emergency department of the hospital to which the driver was taken after the accident. If this be the manner in which the claim is ultimately resolved, the only " complicated point " that may have to be resolved may be confined to s 37 of the New South Wales Act.

Even though it may be accepted that points of general importance may emerge from the most mundane or apparently simple of cases, it is considered that the present proceeding remains a claim made upon an insurance policy in respect to a motor vehicle accident. Even if the jurisdiction of this Court has been properly invoked, such claims only invite inquiry as to whether they should be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. The potential importance to the present parties of such provisions as ss 13 , 21 and 28 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) may also be accepted. The application of such provisions, however, will in all likelihood largely depend upon the facts and circumstances to which they are to be applied. As was recognised by both the Applicant and the Respondent, and depending upon how the facts are ultimately to be resolved, one or other of the " complicated points " may not finally emerge for resolution. And such importance as may emerge from the application of those statutory provisions as may extend beyond the interests of the present parties (if any), it is considered, is no reason why it is not appropriate to transfer the proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>

<tocase>Rahman v Dayeh [2006] FCA 1362</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1362.html</AustLII>
<text>The power to make an order tansferring a proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court is a discretionary power (s 32AB(1)) which may be exercised upon the Court's own initiative (s 32AB(2)(b)). It is thus a power which may be exercised even though an applicant may oppose such an order being made: e.g. Rahman v Dayeh [2006] FCA 1362. But where the parties consent to the making of such an order, Jacobson J has observed that such consent is " decisive ": Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969 at [3] .

Notwithstanding the fact that the Applicant does not wish for the proceeding to be transferred, it is considered that the case essentially involves a motor vehicle accident claim upon an insurance policy. That claim can be expeditiously resolved in the Federal Magistrates Court. As was stated by Gyles J in Rahman v Dayeh at [3]: 
 ... It has been put that the Federal Magistrates Court is an inferior court and that, even if it has jurisdiction, it is best exercised by the Federal Court as a superior court. Federal Magistrates are Federal judicial officers governed by Ch III of the Constitution although, in a sense, judges of an inferior court. Both the qualifications for appointment and the characteristics of those individuals who have been appointed, fit them to undertake jurisdiction which might not previously have been thought appropriate. Even though I must pay regard to the opposition of the applicant, in one sense the applicant may be gaining another level of appeal to this Court. 

 
Although it is not certain whether the proceeding will be heard at an earlier point of time in the Federal Magistrates Court than in this Court, there is no reason why it could not be heard as expeditiously as that Court considers appropriate. Such legal costs as will be incurred, it is to be expected, will be less &#8212; or at least no more &#8212; than those that would be incurred in this Court. The Respondent insurer this morning adopted a " neutral stance " as to whether the proceeding should be transferred.

Notwithstanding the careful written submissions advanced by Counsel for the Applicant, it is not considered that the proceeding involves any point of general importance, let alone a point which should be resolved by a single judge of this Court &#8212; at least initially.

If attention is confined to the Application and the Statement of Claim, the only two " federal aspects " of the claim there advanced are: the claim for interest pursuant to s 57 of the 1984 Act; and the Particulars provided as to a possible implied term of the policy. 
Neither of those matters, nor any other aspect of the Statement of Claim , is considered to raise any point of general importance. Indeed, it is not understood that Counsel for the Applicant sought to contend otherwise. Whether or not any term is to be implied may possibly depend upon a resolution of disputed facts which, it is considered, are best resolved before a Federal Magistrate.</text>
