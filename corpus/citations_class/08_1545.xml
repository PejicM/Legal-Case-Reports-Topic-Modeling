<tocase>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/10.html</AustLII>
<text>74 Section 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) confers power upon this Court to grant declaratory relief. The power conferred is a discretionary power which is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581 2. Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed:
 It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief. It is a discretionary power which "[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise." However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. Hence, declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions. The person seeking relief must have "a real interest" and relief will not be granted if the question "is purely hypothetical", if relief is "claimed in relation to circumstances that [have] not occurred and might never happen" or if "the Court's declaration will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties" (citations omitted).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1399.html</AustLII>
<text>26 Also of general relevance to most (if not all) civil penalty provisions is the significance that a pecuniary penalty may have for deterrence upon both the current offender and others: cf Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-076 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v D M Faulkner Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1666 at [53] per Bennett J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Gullyside Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1727 at [34] per Kiefel J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 at [11] ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 at [15] per Goldberg J. A " civil penalty ", it has been said, " needs to be sufficiently high to deter contravention by others, but not so high as to be oppressive ": Vivian v Fitzgeralds [2007] FCA 1602 at [29] per Logan J. An apparent limited capacity of a respondent to pay cannot mitigate against the need for an appropriate pecuniary penalty to be applied: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [41] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 386 7 per Nicholson J. See also: Beaton-Wells C, 'Recent corporate penalty assessment under the Trade Practices Act and the rise of general deterrence' (2006) 14 CCLJ 65; Yeung K, 'Quantifying Regulatory Penalties: Australian Competition Law Penalties in Perspective' (1999) 23 Melb Univ L Rev 440 (particularly at 468 74).

55 For the purposes of s 42Y(3)(b) , it may finally be noted, the Secretary does not maintain that there has been " any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention ". But, as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115 in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance, " an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor ". His Honour observed at 118 19:
 ... The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission. In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified. Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI, it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O'Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings. Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies, nor indeed any of their customers, suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price. However, I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor. In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller, the question of loss or damage will rarely, if ever, arise. The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. 
The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [29] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 384 when considering s 24(2) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) . The same conclusion should also be reached in respect to s 42Y(3) of the 1989 Act now under consideration.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1085.html</AustLII>
<text>36 That question was answered: " No, but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 disclose no error of principle ". The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another. (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters. (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. 
Five further points were there made by their Honours, being:
 [53] First, the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court, as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition. As Jeremy Thorpe points out, a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts. This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications, if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act: J Thorpe, "Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act" (1996) 4 Comp &amp; Cons LJ 69, at 72 74. ... [54] Secondly, the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean, in our opinion, that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range. A Court may wish to take that approach. However, it is open to a Court, consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods, first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties' proposed figure and then, having made that judgment, determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range. [55] Thirdly, as has been noted, the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court. There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case. The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred. ... [56] Fourthly, as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2002] ATPR 41-851 , has pointed out, the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty. ... ... [58] Fifthly, there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions: (i) The Court, if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided. If they do not provide the information or verification requested, the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range. (ii) If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s 76 of the TP Act, s 13 of the Sites Act, or similar legislation, it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR, O 6 r 17. (iii) If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties, it may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances, for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing. 
See: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 at [13] [18] per Nicholson J. Most recently, it has been said that the " upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties. The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount 'within the permissible range' of penalties that might properly be imposed ": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488 at [9] per Finkelstein J.

<text>42 The requirement for the Court itself to be satisfied as to the appropriateness of a penalty is a responsibility which ultimately derives from s 71 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act and is not a responsibility which can be circumscribed by private agreement: cf Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 402 at [19] per Finn J. And in discharging that responsibility in the context of the Therapeutic Goods Act the Court, as it is in the context of the Trade Practices Act when considering whether to make an order by consent, " is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so ": cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 at [18] , [1999] FCA 18 ; 161 ALR 79 at 86 per French J.

<text>21 Proceedings to recover a civil penalty under s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act , like proceedings under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act , are civil proceedings (s 42Y(4)) and by virtue of s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) attract the civil standard of proof, including for present purposes the principles in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361 3. Section 140 provides as follows:
 Civil proceedings: standard of proof (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and (b) the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding; and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. 

 
It has been said by the Full Court of this Court that the discussion by Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw " of how the civil standard of proof operates appositely expresses the considerations which s 140(2) of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account ": Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 at [31] , [2007] FCAFC 132 ; 162 FCR 466 at 480 per Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ.

<text>76 But there has been a departure from such a confined view, at least in a statutory context where declaratory relief is sought as an adjunct to an order imposing a pecuniary penalty or involving a matter of public interest. In the context of the Trade Practices Act , in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1427 , 236 ALR 665 Kiefel J reviewed the earlier authorities and relevantly concluded as follows:
 [58] The power to grant declarations (s 21 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth)) is unconfined. Order 35A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought. Refusals to make declarations in cases of default are based upon a practice, not a rule of law. The practice is one of long-standing and might be seen as derived from views about litigation which pre-date more recent concerns expressed by the courts as to the costs of unnecessary litigation, the management of cases and efficiency overall. Views expressed in older cases may not take account of the increase in the use made of declaratory orders in developing areas of law which may involve matters of public interest. A caution with respect to the use of older authority is made in the White Book Service 2003 to the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (40.20.2). [59] It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration. Millett J made declaratory orders in Patten v Burke Publishing Co Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 541; [1991] 2 All ER 821 where justice to the plaintiff required it. The order, however, operated principally inter partes and it might be doubted whether it would be of interest to other persons. Cases such as this, involving the protection of consumers, are of public interest. Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct contributes a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness. It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made. This could be overcome by a statement, preceding the declarations, that orders are made: "upon admissions which [the respondent in question] is taken to have made, consequent upon non-compliance with orders of the court". 
An appeal has been dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 , 244 ALR 300. Her Honour's views as to the ability of the Court to grant declaratory relief upon the basis of deemed admissions has since been followed and applied by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [7] [16], [2007] FCA 815 ; 240 ALR 120 at 122 5.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/964.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In addressing the role that agreement between the parties may have when addressing penalties to be imposed under the Trade Practices Act in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed:
 The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the "appropriate" penalty in each particular case, having regard to "all relevant matters" including the matters specified in the section. But effects upon the functioning of markets, and other economic effects, will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant, so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or by economists called on behalf of the parties. Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd [(1981) 60 FLR 38], it has been accepted that both the facts, and also views about their effect, may be presented to the Court in agreed statements, together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty. Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount. There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case. It appears to us that the authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have provided unanimous support for the approach we have outlined... They approved the general acceptance of a "negotiated settlement", reserving for further consideration only the case where a compromise was based, not on considerations bearing on the quantum of the penalty, but on doubts or difficulties attending the proof of the contravention. In Simsmetal [Trade Practices Commission v Simsmetal Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,510], Lee J, in approving agreed penalties, said (at 41,512) that "the approach adopted by the parties in fixing (the figures put to the Court) is not dissimilar to the approach that would have been adopted by the Court had it been necessary for the Court to undertake the penalty fixing exercise itself", and that he agreed with the approach of Lockhart J in another case of refraining from "stating whether the penalties to which the parties have agreed are the size of [those] which the Court itself would have imposed". In Pioneer [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,579] Lockhart J said (at 41,582): 
 
 "I am of the view that the agreement that has been reached, subject to the Court's concurrence, is broadly in accord with what the Court would have done itself based upon the facts as I have read them from the affidavits, and I think the result is a sensible one. I propose to endorse it." 
 
 In TNT [Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4 ; [1995] ATPR 40 ,161] Burchett J said (at 40,165): 
 
 "[I]t cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. It is not done by the application of a formula, and, within a certain range, courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another." 
 
 When the Court approaches the task of assessing a penalty under s 76, or of determining whether an agreed penalty is appropriate, there are certain principles which must be kept steadily in mind. The section itself lays down that the penalty is to be "appropriate having regard to all relevant matters", and then indicates certain matters which the legislature regarded as relevant... 
Reference may also be made to Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964 at [11] where French J stated that the " Court has, over many years, accepted as a general principle that it should encourage fair and appropriate settlements to reduce the burdens of litigation on public and private resources ". See also: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 at [15] [18], [2004] FCA 693 ; 207 ALR 329 at 332 3 per Lee J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v FChem (Aust) Ltd [2008] FCA 344 at [22] [27] per Cowdroy J. These comments were obviously directed to the specific statutory provisions and objectives of the 1974 Act.</text>

<text>34 In addressing the role that agreement between the parties may have when addressing penalties to be imposed under the Trade Practices Act in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed:
 The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the "appropriate" penalty in each particular case, having regard to "all relevant matters" including the matters specified in the section. But effects upon the functioning of markets, and other economic effects, will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant, so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or by economists called on behalf of the parties. Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd [(1981) 60 FLR 38], it has been accepted that both the facts, and also views about their effect, may be presented to the Court in agreed statements, together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty. Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount. There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case. It appears to us that the authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have provided unanimous support for the approach we have outlined... They approved the general acceptance of a "negotiated settlement", reserving for further consideration only the case where a compromise was based, not on considerations bearing on the quantum of the penalty, but on doubts or difficulties attending the proof of the contravention. In Simsmetal [Trade Practices Commission v Simsmetal Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,510], Lee J, in approving agreed penalties, said (at 41,512) that "the approach adopted by the parties in fixing (the figures put to the Court) is not dissimilar to the approach that would have been adopted by the Court had it been necessary for the Court to undertake the penalty fixing exercise itself", and that he agreed with the approach of Lockhart J in another case of refraining from "stating whether the penalties to which the parties have agreed are the size of [those] which the Court itself would have imposed". In Pioneer [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,579] Lockhart J said (at 41,582): 
 
 "I am of the view that the agreement that has been reached, subject to the Court's concurrence, is broadly in accord with what the Court would have done itself based upon the facts as I have read them from the affidavits, and I think the result is a sensible one. I propose to endorse it." 
 
 In TNT [Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4 ; [1995] ATPR 40 ,161] Burchett J said (at 40,165): 
 
 "[I]t cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. It is not done by the application of a formula, and, within a certain range, courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another." 
 
 When the Court approaches the task of assessing a penalty under s 76, or of determining whether an agreed penalty is appropriate, there are certain principles which must be kept steadily in mind. The section itself lays down that the penalty is to be "appropriate having regard to all relevant matters", and then indicates certain matters which the legislature regarded as relevant... 
Reference may also be made to Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964 at [11] where French J stated that the " Court has, over many years, accepted as a general principle that it should encourage fair and appropriate settlements to reduce the burdens of litigation on public and private resources ".

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1716.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Given the written submissions previously filed on behalf of the Secretary as to the penalties then being propounded, some reservation was expressed during the hearing as to whether the then proposed combined penalty of $100,000 was indeed " appropriate ". As was observed by Wilcox, Hill and Carr JJ in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1716 (and as approved by the Full Court in Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 at [56] [57]):
 [56] ... [W]here the Commission proposes to the Court an agreed penalty which is calculated taking into account a substantial discount from what would otherwise be considered the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of co-operation, it would be desirable that the Commission disclose the process by which the discounted penalty has been arrived at. In particular, it would be of assistance to the Court, particularly where there are other proceedings pending, to hear submissions on the range of appropriate penalties and the discount which it is proposed should be allowed to take into account the level of co-operation afforded by the offender. ... 
The figure of $100,000 was such that submissions were sought from both Counsel. The caution previously expressed by Lockhart J, and other judges of this Court, as to the Court refraining from stating whether the penalty to which the parties have agreed was the same as that which the Court would have imposed, is nevertheless heeded.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1488.html</AustLII>
<text>36 That question was answered: " No, but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 disclose no error of principle ". The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another. (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters. (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. 
Five further points were there made by their Honours, being:
 [53] First, the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court, as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition. As Jeremy Thorpe points out, a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts. This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications, if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act: J Thorpe, "Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act" (1996) 4 Comp &amp; Cons LJ 69, at 72 74. ... [54] Secondly, the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean, in our opinion, that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range. A Court may wish to take that approach. However, it is open to a Court, consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods, first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties' proposed figure and then, having made that judgment, determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range. [55] Thirdly, as has been noted, the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court. There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case. The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred. ... [56] Fourthly, as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2002] ATPR 41-851 , has pointed out, the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty. ... ... [58] Fifthly, there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions: (i) The Court, if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided. If they do not provide the information or verification requested, the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range. (ii) If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s 76 of the TP Act, s 13 of the Sites Act, or similar legislation, it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR, O 6 r 17. (iii) If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties, it may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances, for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing. 
See: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 at [13] [18] per Nicholson J. Most recently, it has been said that the " upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties. The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount 'within the permissible range' of penalties that might properly be imposed ": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488 at [9] per Finkelstein J.

<text>24 Thus, in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 French J made the following observations in the context of assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s 76(1) of the Trade Practices Act (at 52,152 52,153).
 The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases. These include the following: 1. The nature and extent of the contravening conduct. 2. The amount of loss or damage caused. 3. The circumstances in which the conduct took place. 4. The size of the contravening company. 5. The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market. 6. The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended. 7. Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level. 8. Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention. 9. Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 
Those observations are both an elaboration of the terms of s 76(1) itself and directed to the legislative context set forth in the 1974 Act. Comparable principles have also been applied when assessing penalties under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act : Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 , 60 ATR 518 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Holloway [2000] FCA 1245 , 45 ATR 278.</text>

Those observations are both an elaboration of the terms of s 76(1) itself and directed to the legislative context set forth in the 1974 Act. Comparable principles have also been applied when assessing penalties under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act : Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 , 60 ATR 518 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Holloway [2000] FCA 1245 , 45 ATR 278.</text>

<text>76 But there has been a departure from such a confined view, at least in a statutory context where declaratory relief is sought as an adjunct to an order imposing a pecuniary penalty or involving a matter of public interest. In the context of the Trade Practices Act , in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1427 , 236 ALR 665 Kiefel J reviewed the earlier authorities and relevantly concluded as follows:
 [58] The power to grant declarations (s 21 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth)) is unconfined. Order 35A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought. Refusals to make declarations in cases of default are based upon a practice, not a rule of law. The practice is one of long-standing and might be seen as derived from views about litigation which pre-date more recent concerns expressed by the courts as to the costs of unnecessary litigation, the management of cases and efficiency overall. Views expressed in older cases may not take account of the increase in the use made of declaratory orders in developing areas of law which may involve matters of public interest. A caution with respect to the use of older authority is made in the White Book Service 2003 to the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (40.20.2). [59] It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration. Millett J made declaratory orders in Patten v Burke Publishing Co Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 541; [1991] 2 All ER 821 where justice to the plaintiff required it. The order, however, operated principally inter partes and it might be doubted whether it would be of interest to other persons. Cases such as this, involving the protection of consumers, are of public interest. Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct contributes a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness. It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made. This could be overcome by a statement, preceding the declarations, that orders are made: "upon admissions which [the respondent in question] is taken to have made, consequent upon non-compliance with orders of the court". 
An appeal has been dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 , 244 ALR 300. Her Honour's views as to the ability of the Court to grant declaratory relief upon the basis of deemed admissions has since been followed and applied by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [7] [16], [2007] FCA 815 ; 240 ALR 120 at 122 5.</text>

Obviously enough, for example, the degree of market power is a consideration likely to be highly relevant to a penalty for a contravention of Pt IV of the TP Act, but is not likely to be relevant to the imposition of a penalty under the EPBC Act. Similarly, the question of a corporate culture may not necessarily have relevance to proceedings under the EPBC Act, although whether a contravener has taken remedial action to minimise environmental damage may be significant on the question of penalty. On the other hand, there may be circumstances relevant to proceedings under the EPBC Act that have no relevance to proceedings under the TP Act. In the end, while the statutory criteria must of course be taken into account, each case must depend upon its own unique circumstances.

<text>5 The objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act include the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods: s 4(1)(a). A useful overview of some of the provisions of the Act has been provided by Emmett J in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230.

6 For present purposes it is sufficient to make reference to but a few provisions.

7 Chapter 2 of the Act provides for the maintenance of a register known as the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Part 3 - 2 of Chapter 3 further provides for the registration and listing of therapeutic goods and provides for exemptions to be granted in respect to certain therapeutic goods which are not registered. Contained within that Part is s 19D which relevantly provides as follows:
 Civil penalties relating to registration or listing etc. of imported, exported, manufactured and supplied therapeutic goods Civil penalty relating to importing, exporting, manufacturing or supplying goods for use in humans (1) A person contravenes this subsection if: (a) the person does any of the following: (i) imports into Australia therapeutic goods for use in humans; ... and (b) none of the following subparagraphs applies in relation to the goods: (i) the goods are registered goods or listed goods in relation to the person; (ii) the goods are exempt goods; (iii) the goods are exempt under section 18A ; (iv) the goods are the subject of an approval or authority under section 19 ; (v) the goods are the subject of an approval under section 19A. Maximum civil penalty: (a) for an individual--5,000 penalty units; and (b) for a body corporate--50,000 penalty units.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72</tocase>
<text>35 But, and as noted by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [59] [79] by Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ, there have been decisions which " have expressed reservations about the approach taken in NW Frozen Foods ". In Mobil Oil a pecuniary penalty was sought in respect to a contravention of s 10 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 (Cth). The resolution of those reservations was there effected by a direction given by the Chief Justice pursuant to s 20(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the jurisdiction of the Court should be exercised by a Full Court in respect to the following question:
 Where the parties propose an agreed amount to be imposed as a penalty pursuant to s 13 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 (Cth), is the Court bound by the decision in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 to consider whether the proposed amount is within the permissible range in all of the circumstances and, if so, impose a penalty of that amount?

37 In the present proceeding it is considered that the principles expressed in NW Frozen Foods and Mobil Oil are equally applicable to a proceeding in which a civil penalty is sought under the Therapeutic Goods Act and where an agreement has been reached as between the Regulator and those against whom the penalty is sought.

48 Given the written submissions previously filed on behalf of the Secretary as to the penalties then being propounded, some reservation was expressed during the hearing as to whether the then proposed combined penalty of $100,000 was indeed " appropriate ". As was observed by Wilcox, Hill and Carr JJ in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1716 (and as approved by the Full Court in Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 at [56] [57]):
 [56] ... [W]here the Commission proposes to the Court an agreed penalty which is calculated taking into account a substantial discount from what would otherwise be considered the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of co-operation, it would be desirable that the Commission disclose the process by which the discounted penalty has been arrived at. In particular, it would be of assistance to the Court, particularly where there are other proceedings pending, to hear submissions on the range of appropriate penalties and the discount which it is proposed should be allowed to take into account the level of co-operation afforded by the offender. ... 
The figure of $100,000 was such that submissions were sought from both Counsel. The caution previously expressed by Lockhart J, and other judges of this Court, as to the Court refraining from stating whether the penalty to which the parties have agreed was the same as that which the Court would have imposed, is nevertheless heeded.</text>

<tocase>NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1996/1134.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In addressing the role that agreement between the parties may have when addressing penalties to be imposed under the Trade Practices Act in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed:
 The Act places on the shoulders of the Court the responsibility to determine the "appropriate" penalty in each particular case, having regard to "all relevant matters" including the matters specified in the section. But effects upon the functioning of markets, and other economic effects, will generally be among the most significant matters to be considered as relevant, so that the Court is likely to be assisted greatly by views put forward by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or by economists called on behalf of the parties. Since the decision in Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd [(1981) 60 FLR 38], it has been accepted that both the facts, and also views about their effect, may be presented to the Court in agreed statements, together with joint submissions by both the Commission and a respondent as to the appropriate level of penalty. Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount. There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case. It appears to us that the authorities in both Australia and New Zealand have provided unanimous support for the approach we have outlined... They approved the general acceptance of a "negotiated settlement", reserving for further consideration only the case where a compromise was based, not on considerations bearing on the quantum of the penalty, but on doubts or difficulties attending the proof of the contravention. In Simsmetal [Trade Practices Commission v Simsmetal Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,510], Lee J, in approving agreed penalties, said (at 41,512) that "the approach adopted by the parties in fixing (the figures put to the Court) is not dissimilar to the approach that would have been adopted by the Court had it been necessary for the Court to undertake the penalty fixing exercise itself", and that he agreed with the approach of Lockhart J in another case of refraining from "stating whether the penalties to which the parties have agreed are the size of [those] which the Court itself would have imposed". In Pioneer [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1996] ATPR 41 ,579] Lockhart J said (at 41,582): 
 
 "I am of the view that the agreement that has been reached, subject to the Court's concurrence, is broadly in accord with what the Court would have done itself based upon the facts as I have read them from the affidavits, and I think the result is a sensible one. I propose to endorse it." 
 
 In TNT [Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4 ; [1995] ATPR 40 ,161] Burchett J said (at 40,165): 
 
 "[I]t cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. It is not done by the application of a formula, and, within a certain range, courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another." 
 
 When the Court approaches the task of assessing a penalty under s 76, or of determining whether an agreed penalty is appropriate, there are certain principles which must be kept steadily in mind. The section itself lays down that the penalty is to be "appropriate having regard to all relevant matters", and then indicates certain matters which the legislature regarded as relevant... 
Reference may also be made to Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964 at [11] where French J stated that the " Court has, over many years, accepted as a general principle that it should encourage fair and appropriate settlements to reduce the burdens of litigation on public and private resources ". See also: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 at [15] [18], [2004] FCA 693 ; 207 ALR 329 at 332 3 per Lee J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v FChem (Aust) Ltd [2008] FCA 344 at [22] [27] per Cowdroy J. These comments were obviously directed to the specific statutory provisions and objectives of the 1974 Act.

35 But, and as noted by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [59] [79] by Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ, there have been decisions which " have expressed reservations about the approach taken in NW Frozen Foods ". In Mobil Oil a pecuniary penalty was sought in respect to a contravention of s 10 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 (Cth). The resolution of those reservations was there effected by a direction given by the Chief Justice pursuant to s 20(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the jurisdiction of the Court should be exercised by a Full Court in respect to the following question:
 Where the parties propose an agreed amount to be imposed as a penalty pursuant to s 13 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 (Cth), is the Court bound by the decision in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 to consider whether the proposed amount is within the permissible range in all of the circumstances and, if so, impose a penalty of that amount?

36 That question was answered: " No, but the reasons in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 disclose no error of principle ". The Full Court reviewed the authorities and observed:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another. (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters. (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. 
Five further points were there made by their Honours, being:
 [53] First, the rationale for giving weight to a joint submission on penalty is said by the Court to be the savings in resources for the regulator and the Court, as well as the likelihood that a negotiated resolution will include measures designed to promote competition. As Jeremy Thorpe points out, a related advantage is that the savings in resources can be used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the courts. This has the effect of increasing deterrence which is one of the principal justifications, if not the only justification for imposing civil penalties under the TP Act or the Sites Act: J Thorpe, "Determining the Appropriate Role for Charge Bargaining in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act" (1996) 4 Comp &amp; Cons LJ 69, at 72 74. ... [54] Secondly, the sixth proposition drawn from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods does not mean, in our opinion, that the Court must commence its reasoning with the proposed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the permissible range. A Court may wish to take that approach. However, it is open to a Court, consistently with the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods, first to address the appropriate range of penalties independently of the parties' proposed figure and then, having made that judgment, determine whether the prepared penalty falls within the range. [55] Thirdly, as has been noted, the appellant in NW Frozen Foods admitted contravening the TP Act and had reached agreement with the ACCC upon the facts to be put before the Court. There was no suggestion that the admissions or statement had been tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the ACCC in proving its case. The Full Court therefore acted on the basis of clear admissions and a detailed statement of agreed facts setting out how the contraventions had occurred. ... [56] Fourthly, as the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2002] ATPR 41-851 , has pointed out, the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning that justifies a discounted penalty. ... ... [58] Fifthly, there is nothing in NW Frozen Foods that is inconsistent with any of the following propositions: (i) The Court, if it considers that the evidence or information before it is inadequate to form a view as to whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, may request the parties to provide additional evidence or information or verify the information provided. If they do not provide the information or verification requested, the Court may well not be satisfied that the proposed penalty is within the range. (ii) If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s 76 of the TP Act, s 13 of the Sites Act, or similar legislation, it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR, O 6 r 17. (iii) If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties, it may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances, for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing. 
See: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 at [13] [18] per Nicholson J. Most recently, it has been said that the " upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties. The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount 'within the permissible range' of penalties that might properly be imposed ": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488 at [9] per Finkelstein J. See also: Beaton-Wells C, 'Judicial Scrutiny of Penalty Agreements to Increase' (2005) 13 TPLJ 59.

37 In the present proceeding it is considered that the principles expressed in NW Frozen Foods and Mobil Oil are equally applicable to a proceeding in which a civil penalty is sought under the Therapeutic Goods Act and where an agreement has been reached as between the Regulator and those against whom the penalty is sought.

41 Part of the agreement in the present proceeding, which has avoided potential difficulties and complexities, is that the First and/or Second Respondent pay a penalty in the revised sum of $130,000. The question remains as to whether the Court considers that such a sum is " appropriate " within the meaning of s 42Y(2). As was recognised by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods , " the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science ": [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076</tocase>
<text>24 Thus, in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 French J made the following observations in the context of assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s 76(1) of the Trade Practices Act (at 52,152 52,153).
 The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases. These include the following: 1. The nature and extent of the contravening conduct. 2. The amount of loss or damage caused. 3. The circumstances in which the conduct took place. 4. The size of the contravening company. 5. The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market. 6. The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended. 7. Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level. 8. Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention. 9. Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 
Those observations are both an elaboration of the terms of s 76(1) itself and directed to the legislative context set forth in the 1974 Act. Comparable principles have also been applied when assessing penalties under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act : Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 , 60 ATR 518 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Holloway [2000] FCA 1245 , 45 ATR 278.

25 In Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 , 136 LGERA 89 Sackville J reviewed the authorities and likewise concluded that the specific legislative context in which a penalty is being sought must obviously prevail. His Honour was there considering the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth). Reference was made to the checklist provided by French J in the CSR case and His Honour continued:
 [58] The principles formulated in the context of s 76(1) of the TP Act provide guidance in proceedings for pecuniary penalties under the EPBC Act, although they cannot be transferred uncritically into the rather different context of proceedings seeking the imposition of penalties for environmental damage to protected sites. Obviously enough, for example, the degree of market power is a consideration likely to be highly relevant to a penalty for a contravention of Pt IV of the TP Act, but is not likely to be relevant to the imposition of a penalty under the EPBC Act. Similarly, the question of a corporate culture may not necessarily have relevance to proceedings under the EPBC Act, although whether a contravener has taken remedial action to minimise environmental damage may be significant on the question of penalty. On the other hand, there may be circumstances relevant to proceedings under the EPBC Act that have no relevance to proceedings under the TP Act. In the end, while the statutory criteria must of course be taken into account, each case must depend upon its own unique circumstances. 
His Honour's decision was affirmed on appeal: Greentree v Minister for Environment and Heritage [2005] FCAFC 128 , 144 FCR 388. The application by the trial judge of the " principles " he identified does not appear to have been the subject of debate on appeal: [2005] FCAFC 128 at [51] [57].

26 Also of general relevance to most (if not all) civil penalty provisions is the significance that a pecuniary penalty may have for deterrence upon both the current offender and others: cf Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-076 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v D M Faulkner Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1666 at [53] per Bennett J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Gullyside Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1727 at [34] per Kiefel J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 at [11] ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 at [15] per Goldberg J. A " civil penalty ", it has been said, " needs to be sufficiently high to deter contravention by others, but not so high as to be oppressive ": Vivian v Fitzgeralds [2007] FCA 1602 at [29] per Logan J. An apparent limited capacity of a respondent to pay cannot mitigate against the need for an appropriate pecuniary penalty to be applied: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [41] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 386 7 per Nicholson J. See also: Beaton-Wells C, 'Recent corporate penalty assessment under the Trade Practices Act and the rise of general deterrence' (2006) 14 CCLJ 65; Yeung K, 'Quantifying Regulatory Penalties: Australian Competition Law Penalties in Perspective' (1999) 23 Melb Univ L Rev 440 (particularly at 468 74).

28 In addition to the more general factors referred to in CSR , and in the specific context of the Therapeutic Goods Act , there was agreement between the parties that further " relevant matters " within the meaning of s 42Y(3) also included (in particular) the following:
 
(i) the object of maintaining a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods; 
 
(ii) the object of creating a national Register;
 
(iii) the fact that the Act creates both civil and criminal offences, the latter being punishable by imprisonment; 
 
(iv) the particular difficulties that may be encountered in detecting a contravention of the 1989 legislation; and 
 
(v) the particular difficulties that may be confronted if an application was to be defended and the Secretary put to proof.
 
All of these matters place emphasis upon an important public interest in maintaining the integrity of the legislative regime in respect to therapeutic products. Further matters of relevance in the present statutory context, as in many (if not all) civil penalty cases are:
 
(vi) whether or not there has been co-operation by a respondent in the conduct of a proceeding; and
 
(vii) whether or not there has been agreement as to the relief to be granted.

29 These matters, it is considered, emerge from a proper construction of the Act itself. They are only reinforced by a recognition that s 42Y was inserted by way of an amendment effected by the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act (No 1) 2006 (Cth). During the course of the Second Reading Speech in the House of Representatives on 17 August 2005 of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2005 (Cth), the then Minister for Health and Ageing said:
 The bill introduces a parallel civil penalty regime for breaches of the act. The inclusion in the act of civil penalties, alongside criminal penalties, will allow for an alternative and quicker process for dealing with a wide range of legislative breaches. Civil penalties are expected to be more effective in deterring and preventing non-compliance with regulatory requirements by body corporates, who represent the bulk of those regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and regulations. Higher penalty levels attach to civil penalties because they are designed to provide adequate incentives, especially in relation to well-resourced corporate entities, for deterring breaches of regulatory requirements under the act. The inclusion of alternative civil penalties and criminal offences is an effective strategy that has worked well under other Commonwealth legislation.

30 Prior to the commencement of the hearing on 7 October 2008, there was agreement between the parties as to the facts; but there was no agreement as to the relief to be granted. At that stage, the task of the Court was to apply the principles to such facts as were the subject of agreement and to those further facts set forth in three Affidavits filed by the Respondents and the cross-examination of those deponents.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/527.html</AustLII>
<text>55 For the purposes of s 42Y(3)(b) , it may finally be noted, the Secretary does not maintain that there has been " any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention ". But, as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115 in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance, " an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor ". His Honour observed at 118 19:
 ... The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission. In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified. Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI, it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O'Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings. Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies, nor indeed any of their customers, suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price. However, I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor. In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller, the question of loss or damage will rarely, if ever, arise. The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. 
The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [29] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 384 when considering s 24(2) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) . The same conclusion should also be reached in respect to s 42Y(3) of the 1989 Act now under consideration.</text>
