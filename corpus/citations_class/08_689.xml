<text>16 I am prepared to treat the appellant's submissions as an application for leave to appeal and deal with it accordingly. It is, as I explained to the appellant, well established that the Court will only grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision of the Federal Magistrates Court if the person seeking that leave can show that there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court to warrant review and, secondly, assuming the judgment below to be wrong, that substantial injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused: see Decor Corporation Proprietary Limited v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397.

17 The Court is only in a position, when hearing appeals from the Federal Magistrates Court, to act on the evidence that was before the Tribunal and that was, in turn, considered by the Federal Magistrates Court. This Court is not, save in exceptional cases, in a position to receive additional evidence that was not placed before the Tribunal. It is concerned to determine whether, in conducting the judicial review of the Tribunal's decision, the Federal Magistrates Court erred in law.

18 The appellant's notice of appeal, which I will treat as a draft notice of appeal, alleged that the Federal Magistrate erred because, first, the appellant was not given enough time to submit all the documents which he had. Secondly, that he considered the decision given by the Federal Magistrates Court was "inappropriate". Thirdly, that the circumstances in which the country of Pakistan has recently found itself led to him feeling very threatened for his life. He asked that this Court review his case "deeply". Whilst one may have a good deal of sympathy with an appellant who comes from a country such as Pakistan where there is considerable political turmoil at present, it can only intervene, as I have already said, if it finds error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.</text>
