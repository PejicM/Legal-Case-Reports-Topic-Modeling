<tocase>Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's Pty Limited [2001] NSWCA 187</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2001/187.html</AustLII>
<text>27 In my opinion, there is a serious question to be tried at a final hearing as to whether Exact (and through it ESA) have breached an implied obligation of good faith to cooperate in achieving the contractual objects found in the Distributorship Agreement. The principle embodied in this implied obligation was stated by the NSW Court of Appeal in Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's Pty Limited [2001] NSWCA 187 at [169] and following. The obligation includes an implied covenant not to prevent the performance of the contract or to withhold its benefits.

28 By keeping the Distributorship Agreement on foot and thereby obliging Hume to perform its obligations to locate and service customers, whilst at the same time asserting a right to entice those customers away from Hume, Exact appears to be acting in breach of its implied obligation. This is a sufficient basis to warrant the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief subject to considerations of the balance of convenience.

29 An alternative basis available at this stage of the proceedings is that the information about customers supplied by Hume through the portal is given to Exact for a limited purpose and is otherwise confidential. Exact's assertion that it is entitled to use this information to target Hume's customers during the course of the existing Distributorship Agreement seems to me to raise a serious question of misuse of the information.</text>

<text>35 ESA also placed some store on the choice of law clause in Article 27 of the Distributorship Agreement. It was submitted for ESA that the exclusive jurisdiction clause found in Article 27 would point strongly against the grant of leave to serve Exact outside the jurisdiction. Leave has not yet been granted, but ESA argues at this stage that there are strong prospects that it will be refused when that application is heard. In my view, this argument fails to have regard to the decision of the Full Court in Hi-Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 5) (1998) 90 FCR 1 at 24 25. The claims which Hume makes against Exact include claims under the Trade Practices Act which do not ordinarily fall within the purview of this type of clause.</text>

Nor does the entire agreement clause in Article 25 of the Distributorship Agreement persuade me that there is no serious question to go to a final hearing; see for example, Lawson Hill Estate Pty Ltd v Tovegold Pty Ltd (2004) 214 ALR 478 at [82] [83].</text>

<tocase>Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia No 3 [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/30.html</AustLII>
<text>36 There was debate about the form of any interlocutory relief. Counsel for Hume relied upon Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia No 3 [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [33] for the proposition that relief in wide terms should be granted, and said that this should extend to mandatory injunctive relief if necessary. However, it seems to me that the proper exercise of my discretion is that interlocutory injunctive relief should be limited to the prevention of enticement of Hume's customers. This can be stated in sufficiently clear terms to prevent the actions which ESA has sought to achieve, in particular at the 18 October 2006 marketing event. The precise steps which ESA must take to comply with the injunction will be up to it, but clearly enough ESA and Mr Urand should be restrained from soliciting the business of Hume's existing customers in the manner sought to be achieved by ESA.

37 I will make orders in terms of paragraphs 2(a)(A) and 2(a)(B) of the notice of motion. The terms "Relevant Person" and "Distributorship Agreement" will be defined as set out in the notice of motion. I do not consider that any of the other orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the notice of motion should be made.

38 The orders that I will make are upon the applicants by their counsel giving the usual undertaking as to damages. I will order the second and fourth respondents to pay the costs of the applicants of the day of 13 October 2006.

 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson J.
