<tocase>Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2005] FCA 1290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1290-.html</AustLII>
<text>2 The Takeovers Panel was established under s 171 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 (Cth) and continued in existence under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), as described in Schedule 3 to the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Panel'). The proceeding should be understood in the context of the Court's orders of 14 September 2005, made in Glencore International AG &amp; Anor v Takeovers Panel &amp; Ors [2005] FCA 1290.

3 The questions in the proceeding depend upon the effect of certain transactions described as ' cash settled equity swaps '. A cash settled equity swap is an arrangement between an investor and a bank whereby the bank agrees to pay the investor an amount equal to the difference between the value of a given number of equity securities at the time of the closing out of the swap and the value of those equity securities at the time when the arrangement was entered into. Under such an arrangement the investor does not acquire any interest in any equity securities and the investor has no right to call for delivery of equity securities or to require the bank to undertake any action involving the acquisition, holding or disposal of equity securities. Closing out of, and settlement under, such a swap will, depending on the terms of the arrangement, be either at the option of one party or be automatic. Of course, it would always be open to the parties to close out a swap by mutual agreement at any time. In order to hedge its risk under such an arrangement, a bank might buy the relevant equity securities.

4 The fourth respondent, Austral Coal Limited ('the Company'), is a miner of coking coal in southern New South Wales. It sells coking coal both domestically and internationally. The second respondent, Centennial Coal Company Limited ('Centennial'), is also a miner and marketer of coal. At relevant times, shares in the Company and Centennial were listed for quotation on Australian Stock Exchange Limited ('ASX').

28 Chapter 6 of the Act is concerned with ' Takeovers '. Part 6.1 is concerned with Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares and Part 6.2 deals with Exceptions to the prohibition . Parts 6.3 to 6.9 regulate the making and acceptance of takeover offers. Part 6.10 deals with the review of, and intervention in, the conduct of takeovers by the Commission and by the Panel.

29 The pivotal provision of the Act in relation to the regulation of takeovers is s 606. Relevantly, s 606(1) prohibits a person from acquiring a relevant interest in issued voting shares in a company if, because of the transaction, that person's, or someone else's, voting power in the company increases:
 
 &#8226; from 20 per cent or below to more than 20 per cent; or
 &#8226; from a starting point that is above 20 per cent and below 90 per cent.

30 Section 608(1) provides that a person has a relevant interest in shares if that person:
 
 &#8226; is the holder of the shares;
 &#8226; has power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to vote attached to the shares; or
 &#8226; has power to dispose of, or control the exercise of a power to dispose of, the shares. 

Section 608(2) provides for extended circumstances in which 'power' and 'control' may arise for the purposes of determining whether a person has a relevant interest in securities.</text>

<tocase>R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman (1980) 144 CLR 13</tocase>
<text>27 The Commission was the effective contradictor of Glencore and Fornax. However, the Panel has made written submission as to matters that are said to go to the powers and procedures of the Panel. In its written submissions, the Panel indicated that it endeavoured to confine its submissions to questions of principle and to refrain from presenting a substantive case as to the application of those principles, consistent with the observations of the High Court in R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex Parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 at 36.</text>

<tocase>Brierly Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1997) 78 FCR 255</tocase>
<text>34 Under s 657A(1) of the Act, which is in Part 6.10, the Panel may declare circumstances in relation to the affairs of a company to be unacceptable circumstances. Section 657A(1) of the Act expressly provides that the Panel may make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances even in the absence of a contravention of the Act. It follows that the Panel's functions under s 657A include a supervisory role in respect of conduct that is lawful but perceived to be inconsistent with the objects of Chapter 6, as stated in s 602 (see Brierly Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1997) 78 FCR 255 at pp 261-262).

35 The effect of s 657A(2) of the Act is that the Panel may declare circumstances in relation to the affairs of a company to be unacceptable circumstances if it appears to the Panel that the circumstances are unacceptable, having regard to the effect of the circumstances on :
 
 &#8226; the control, or potential control , of that company or another company; or
 &#8226; the acquisition, or proposed acquisition , by a person of a substantial interest in that company or another company. 

The Panel may also make a declaration if it appears to the Panel that circumstances constitute or give rise to a contravention of Parts 6, 6A, 6B or 6C. However, the Panel may only make a declaration if it considers that doing so is not against the public interest and after taking into account any policy considerations that the Panel considers relevant.

36 Under s 657D(1) of the Act, the Panel may make an order under s 657D(2) if it has declared circumstances to be unacceptable under s 657A. However, there are restrictions upon the making of such an order. The Panel must not make an order if it is satisfied that the order would unfairly prejudice any person. Further, under s 657D(1), before making an order, the Panel must give, both to the parties to a proceeding before the Panel and to the Commission, as well as to each other person to whom a proposed order relates , an opportunity to make submissions to the Panel about the matter.

135 The Panel, of course, is expressly empowered by s 657A(1) to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act. Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Chapter 6. It is clear enough that the regime involving the Panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Chapter 6 ( Brierley Investments Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1997) 78 FCR 255 at 261). The Panel made its declaration because, notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act, the purposes of Chapter 6, as expressed in s 602, were not achieved. That is precisely the circumstances for which s 657A provides. It is not unreasonable for the Panel, if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised, to reach that conclusion. The fact that participants in the market do not necessarily make disclosure of cash settled swaps does not necessarily mean that the failure to do so is not unacceptable.

136 I consider that the Panel erred in concluding that the relationship between Glencore on the one hand and the Banks on the other, by reason of the swaps, was such that the Shares in the company held by the Banks should be taken into account in determining whether Glencore had acquired or was acquiring a substantial interest in the Company. I also consider that the Panel erred in concluding that circumstances consisting of the non-disclosure, during the Non-disclosure Period, of the swaps and the relevant interest held by Glencore had an effect on the control or potential control of the Company, or on the acquisition by Centennial of a substantial interest in the Company, that was unacceptable. Having regard to those conclusions, it appears to follow that neither the Declaration nor the Orders can stand.

137 However, the parties have requested that I make no orders until they have had the opportunity of considering the conclusions that I have reached. Accordingly, I propose to stand the matter over for further submissions as to the appropriate orders after the parties have had a reasonable opportunity of considering my conclusions and my reasons for those conclusions. 
 

 I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-seven (137) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.
