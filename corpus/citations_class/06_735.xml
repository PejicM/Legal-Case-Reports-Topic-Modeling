<tocase>Lambe v Director-General of Social Services (1981) 57 FLR 262</tocase>
<text>37 An example of an earlier statutory formula giving effect to such a distinction was considered by the Full Federal Court in Lambe v Director-General of Social Services (1981) 57 FLR 262. The question was whether a single mother in receipt of a supporting parent benefit was '... living with ... a man as his wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married to him'. In deciding whether such a relationship existed the Court held that it was necessary to take into account a variety of factors, albeit no factors were spelt out in the statute. The Court held that all facets of the interpersonal relationship of the two persons had to be taken into account. Importantly (at 271): 
 
 '... the question of the financial support which [the man] provides is an important although not necessarily crucial consideration, but is only one of a number of relevant matters which the Tribunal should take into account in characterizing, as required by the definition, the nature of the relationship ...'.

38 The same statutory formula was considered by Fitzgerald J in Lynam v Director-General of Social Security (1983) 52 ALR 128. He applied Lambe and said, inter alia (at 131): 
 
 'Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. What must be looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. The endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. In any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.'

39 The criterion of marital relationship was considered O'Loughlin J in Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1991) 32 FCR 164. The question in that case was whether a woman claiming a sole parent's pension was 'a married person ... living separately and apart from her spouse'. Having separated from her husband she had returned home as a matter of convenience and because of his assistance in caring for their disabled child. O'Loughlin J referred to Lambe and Lynam . He endorsed the observations of Fitzgerald J quoted earlier. He said (at 173):
 
 '... it is not sufficient to merely note that a couple are sharing accommodation, nor is it sufficient to note that one is financially dependent on the other; it is necessary to delve deeper to find the reasons for those arrangements. Those reasons will be better indicators in determining the correct nature of their relationship.'</text>

<tocase>Cadman v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1993) 31 ALD 486</tocase>
<text>41 The Social Security and Veterans Affairs Amendment Legislation Act (No 3) 1989 (Cth) amended the Social Services Act 1947 by introducing the concept of a person 'living with the other person in a marriage-like relationship' (new s 43A(6)). The assessment of such a relationship required consideration of the same factors that apply today (new s 3A). In Cadman v Secretary, Department of Society Security (1993) 31 ALD 486, Neaves J noted that the Tribunal under appeal had applied the new criteria even though it was dealing with a case to which the old test applied. That was the test of 'living with a man as his wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married to him'. However, his Honour held, each of the listed matters considered under the new s 3A of the former Act was as relevant to that task as it was to the test of a marriage-like relationship (at 490). This merely illustrates the similarities of the kind of decision-making which is required under each of the statutory formulae and, to that extent, the continuing utility of the older authorities.

42 The Social Security (No Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1995 (Cth) deleted the requirement that a marriage-like relationship required the parties to it to be 'living' together and substituted the term 'has a relationship with a person'. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill stated that the changes were designed to ensure that sole parent pensions would not be paid to couples only temporarily living apart. But in a useful commentary on the provisions Sutherland P, Annotations to the Social Security Act 1991 (5 th ed, Federation Press, 1998) states, correctly in my view, (at 12-13):
 
 'In fact the way the amendments are framed means that they have a wider effect: firstly, they will apply to all payments, not just sole parent pension; and secondly, they will have a relevant effect on the initial issue as to whether a "marriage-like relationship" exists.'

43 When the 'marriage-like relationship' provisions were first inserted in the Social Services Act 1947 similar provisions were introduced into the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth), they being ss 5E(2) and 11A . The latter section sets out criteria for determining the existence of a marriage-like relationship for determining whether a person is a member of a 'couple' under s 5E(2). The criteria are the same as those in the Social Security Act see generally Creyke R and Sutherland P, Veterans' Entitlements Law (Federation Press, 2000) at 168-172.</text>

<tocase>Garner v Repatriation Commission (1998) 53 ALD 297</tocase>
<text>44 The formula of the words 'living together in a marriage-like relationship' used in s 11A , as included in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 by 1989 amendments, was considered by Tamberlin J in Garner v Repatriation Commission (1998) 53 ALD 297. His Honour observed, relevantly to the current provisions of s 4(3) of the Act, that s 11A required regard to be had to all of the circumstances of the relationship, albeit it set out a number of matters which must be taken into account.

45 There have of course been a number of Tribunal decisions on the marriage-like relationship provisions and these are referred to in the text books cited above. It would, however, be multiplying discussions of various factual situations to canvass those decisions.

46 Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex: 
 
 1. Must have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). 

2. Must have regard to each of: 
 (a) the financial aspects of the relationship;
 (b) the nature of the household; 
 (c) the social aspects of the relationship; 
 (d) any sexual relationship between the people; 
 (e) the nature of the people's commitment to each other. 
 
 3. In having regard to the preceding five matters, must have regard to all factors relevant to each and, in particular, must have regard to the factors listed under each heading in s 4(3).
 4. Must specifically consider the total picture of the relationship created by all of these factors bearing in mind that consideration must be given to those which weigh against a marriage-like relationship and those which weigh in favour of it. 
 5. Must undertake the preceding consideration bearing in mind that a marriage-like relationship is not disclosed solely by any one of the following matters: 
 (a) financial cooperation; 
 (b) cohabitation; 
 (c) a sexual relationship; 
 (d) cooperative household arrangements; 
 (e) mutual commitment.

61 The Tribunal's general conclusion was that (at [45]):
 
 '... the weight of evidence supports the finding that at the relevant time Ms Pelka was in a marriage-like relationship....' 
 

This conclusion did not proceed, as one might have expected, from a weighing of the various factors against each other. It is plain that there were matters pointing in different directions. A decision-maker in applying the matters set out in s 4(3) should acknowledge that they are non-exhaustive and at least indicate that consideration has been given to whether there might be any other factors relevant to the difficult judgment of whether a 'marriage-like' relationship exists. Each of the individual matters listed in s 4(3) is accompanied by a non-exhaustive list of factors. Again, the decision-maker in each case should consider whether there are any other factors relevant to the particular matter listed see Garner (supra). The Tribunal quoted a passage from a decision of the Tribunal in Re: Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services and WAP [2000] AATA 7. It is not clear however from the reasons how it applied the non-exhaustive approach set out in the passage which it quoted.</text>
