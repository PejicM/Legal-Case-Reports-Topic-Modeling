<tocase>Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/1.html</AustLII>
<text>76 As far as other discretionary reasons are concerned, the respondent submitted that one possible result of the proceedings in the Family Court is that that Court will make orders with respect to the Angas Street property that will only benefit the applicant's estate and, therefore, the creditors of the estate, if the applicant is bankrupt at the time the orders are made. Counsel for the respondent referred to authorities dealing with the Family Court's power to make orders affecting third parties. He referred to Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337. Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) said (at 354-355):
 The position is, I think, different if the alleged rights, powers or privileges of the third party are only a sham and have been brought into being, in appearance rather than reality, as a device to assist one party to evade his or her obligations under the Act . Sham transactions may always be disregarded. Similarly, if a company is completely controlled by one party to a marriage, so that in reality an order against the company is an order against the party, the fact that in form the order appears to affect the rights of the company may not necessarily invalidate it.</text>

<tocase>Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/19.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The principles which govern an application under s 178 are as follows:
 
1. Section 178 confers a "supervisory jurisdiction over the conduct of the trustee": Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124 at 132 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The section confers on the Court a very wide discretion: McGoldrick v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 636 ; (1993) 47 FCR 547 at 552-553.
 
2. It is not necessary for an applicant for relief under the section to show that the trustee's decision was absurd, or unreasonable or taken in bad faith. The Court has a wide discretion to make such order as seems appropriate in the circumstances of the case: Re Tyndall; Ex parte Official Receiver (1977) 30 FLR 6 at 9-10; [1977] FCA 15 ; 17 ALR 182 at 186 per Deane J. At the same time, the Court will be slow to make orders which will have the effect of interfering in the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate and, in cases involving an exercise of business or commercial judgment, will place considerable weight on the trustee's decision. Furthermore, a Court will not intervene under s 178 simply because the Judge forms a different view from that of the trustee.
 
3. An order may be made under s 178 even if the trustee's decision was correct on the material before him, if, for example, additional material is put before the Court.
 
4. The power to make orders under s 178 is not necessarily ousted by the presence of an alternative remedy. In any particular case, the presence of an alternative remedy may lead to an argument that the alternative procedure is a code for correcting alleged errors by a trustee. That was a possibility discussed by the Full Court of this Court in McGoldrick , although the argument did not succeed in that case. In almost all cases, the presence of an alternative remedy will be relevant to the exercise of a discretion under s 178 not to make an order. There is, with respect, an illuminating discussion of the relevant principles by French J in Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101. 
 
Counsel for the respondent in this case referred to McGoldrick and the argument that an alternative review procedure might be construed as a code excluding relief under s 178 , but by the time of their respective closing submissions both parties accepted that there is no alternative review procedure which might affect this application either as a matter of law or as a matter of discretion. The position taken by the parties is correct because the review procedure in Part VII , Division 2, Subdivision C relates to a trustee's decision to file a notice of objection (s 149K(1)) ; not a decision (or act or omission) by a trustee not to withdraw an objection.</text>

<tocase>Eshelby v Federated European Bank Ltd [1932] 1 KB 254</tocase>
<text>37 It was common ground between the parties that there had been an act, omission or decision of the respondent within s 178 and that that related to the non-withdrawal of the objections under s 149J. The applicant submitted that that occurred before the proceeding was commenced on 8 August 2007. First, he submitted that he wrote to the respondent by letter dated 6 August 2007 and asked him to withdraw the objections. The respondent submitted that he did not receive the letter at about this time. It is not necessary for me to resolve this factual dispute because on any view the respondent was entitled to a reasonable time to consider the request and he was not given it. Secondly, the applicant submitted that the fact that the respondent had not withdrawn the objections before the proceeding was commenced was an omission within s 178. I doubt whether that can be so in circumstances where there is no evidence of a request by the applicant or of a decision by the respondent under s 149J. The respondent submitted that he made a decision not to withdraw the objections on or about 13 March 2008 and that is evidenced by his affidavit sworn on that date. That was after the applicant had sworn his affidavit on 6 March 2008 exhibiting his income tax returns for the financial years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2007 inclusive and filed and served that affidavit. In my opinion, that submission is correct. I do not think there is a problem with the rule in Eshelby v Federated European Bank Ltd [1932] 1 KB 254 bearing in mind the rules of this Court (Federal Court Rules O 13, rr 2(8) and 3A).

38 I should record also that neither party suggested that the respondent could not file the fifth notice of objection or that I could not take it into account even though it was filed after this proceeding was commenced. Nor was it suggested by either party that I could not take into account the fact that the applicant provided the income tax returns previously referred to on or about 6 March 2008.

39 As I have said, the applicant did not challenge the decision of the respondent to file the fourth and fifth notices of objection and his application proceeded on the basis that there were proper grounds for the objections in the fourth and fifth notices of objection at the time they were made.</text>

<tocase>In re Condon; Ex parte James (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609</tocase>
<text>74 As to the third issue, neither counsel made submissions about whether the respondent was entitled at law to use the sum of $4,217.67 to discharge a liability other than the liability identified by the payor. It is far from clear that he was: Halsbury's Laws of England (4 th ed) Vol 9 [956]-[960]. The applicant's counsel put a different argument and that was that even if the respondent was legally entitled to do what he did the respondent as an officer of the Court was bound to act fairly and he had not acted fairly by purporting to allocate the payment to a liability other than that identified by the payor. The applicant's counsel sought to invoke the principle in In re Condon; Ex parte James (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609 (see Re Clark (a bankrupt); Ex parte the trustee of the property of the bankrupt v Texaco Ltd [1975] 1 All ER 453; [1975] 1 WLR 559). I do not think that there is any room for the application of that principle in this case. The payment was not made by a third party but by the bankrupt and the payment was not made in circumstances of unfairness leading to the enrichment of the estate.</text>

<tocase>Frost v Sheahan [2005] FCA 1014</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1014.html</AustLII>
<text>6 The applicant has previously made an application for an order under s 178. That application was made on 13 December 2004. It was dismissed by Lander J on 28 July 2005: Frost v Sheahan [2005] FCA 1014.

7 The applicant is an accountant. He has tertiary qualifications and considerable experience. He worked as an accountant both before and after he was made bankrupt. As I understand it, he continues to practise as an accountant.

8 At the time of his bankruptcy, the applicant was the joint owner with his wife, Mrs Robyn Frost, of a residential property at Mayfield Crescent, Hallett Cove, South Australia ("Mayfield Crescent property"). He and Mrs Frost have since divorced. At the time of the applicant's bankruptcy, the Mayfield Crescent property was subject to a number of mortgages and it remains subject to those mortgages. There is a first registered mortgage in favour of Australian Finance Company Pty Ltd which secures a debt of approximately $185,000. There are also two registered mortgages in favour of the applicant's solicitor, Mr Paul Richardson, each securing a sum of $50,000 alleged to be unpaid legal fees owed by the applicant to Mr Richardson.

12 Since the applicant's bankruptcy the respondent has filed five objections to the applicant's discharge from bankruptcy. Four notices were filed before the previous proceeding before Lander J was commenced (that is, 13 December 2004) and one was filed after the commencement of the present proceeding on 8 August 2007.

13 The details of the four notices of objection filed by the respondent before the date the previous proceeding was commenced are as follows:
 
1. The first notice of objection is dated 4 February 2002 and the grounds of the objection were that the applicant had failed to provide to the respondent information in relation to his income and he had failed to disclose in his statement of affairs his interest in the Cullen Bay property. On an application for review the Inspector-General upheld the first ground, but decided to cancel the second ground. On 13 May 2002 the applicant lodged an income questionnaire with the Official Receiver and on 4 June 2002 the respondent filed a notice withdrawing the first notice of objection under s 149J. 
 
2. The second notice of objection is dated 14 June 2002 and the grounds of the objection were that the applicant failed to make income contribution payments pursuant to s 139ZG of the Act . On an application for review, the Inspector-General varied the assessments for CAP1 and CAP2. The Tribunal upheld the Inspector-General's decision on a further application for review and on 20 December 2002 the Official Receiver advised that the objection had been upheld and entered on the National Personal Insolvency Index. Lander J found that this objection was appropriate when made, but had been attended to before his decision. However, Lander J held that the respondent had not erred in refusing to withdraw the second objection even though the applicant had fully responded to it because there were proper reasons for the administration of the estate to continue.
 
3. The third notice of objection is dated 2 December 2003 and the ground of the objection was that the applicant had engaged in misleading conduct in that he had improperly diverted funds from the bank account relating to the Cullen Bay property to his own use. On an application for review, the Inspector-General decided that the applicant's conduct did not constitute misleading conduct and he cancelled the objection. On 23 July 2004 the Inspector-General advised that the objection was cancelled.
 
4. The fourth notice of objection is dated 14 July 2004 and the grounds of the objection were that the applicant failed to disclose any particulars of income or expected income as he was required to do by s 139U , and he failed to make payments for which he was liable under s 139ZG. On an application for review the Inspector-General upheld the grounds of objection. Lander J found that the objection was appropriate when filed; he said that he was unable to make a finding as to whether the applicant had satisfied the objection insofar as it relied on the applicant's failure to make payments for which he was liable. However, he found that even if the applicant had made the payments he was required to make, there were proper reasons for the administration of the estate to continue.

14 As I have said, this proceeding was commenced on 8 August 2007. On 12 November 2007 the respondent filed a fifth notice of objection to the applicant's discharge from bankruptcy. The ground of the objection in that notice is the applicant's failure to disclose particulars of income or expected income as required by s 139U. The objection relates to the CAPs commencing on 4 September 2004, 4 September 2005, 4 September 2006 and 4 September 2007 respectively.

15 On 6 March 2008 the applicant filed and served an affidavit sworn by him which annexed his income tax returns for the financial years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2007 inclusive. That was done after this proceeding had been commenced and was done, it seems, to overcome a submission that the applicant had still not provided the information he was required to provide by reason of s 139U.

45 When the matter was before Lander J in the middle of 2005, the question of compliance with the first ground in the fourth notice of objection appears, so far as can be gleaned from his Honour's reasons, to have been given little, if any, prominence by the parties. His Honour did not make an express finding on the matter. Having said that, I note that in the context of considering whether there were proper discretionary reasons for allowing the administration of a bankrupt estate to continue, his Honour found that ongoing inquiries may be made into whether income contributions that had been made to date had been adequate and he said (at [133]):
 Those investigations may reveal that increased contributions should be made.

46 As I understand it, the applicant submits that the provision of his income tax returns on 6 March 2008, including those for the financial years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2004 inclusive, puts the question of whether he has substantially complied with s 139U in relation to the period from 2000 to 2004 beyond doubt.

47 The position in relation to the period from 2004 to 2007 is clearer than it is in relation the earlier period. As I understand it, the applicant did not provide any information in relation to that period before 6 March 2008 when he provided income tax returns for the financial years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2007 inclusive, and an estimate of his income for the financial year ended 30 June 2008.

59 The applicant sought to meet the argument that there was a proper basis for concluding that further investigations into his income were necessary by making a number of submissions. First, he submitted that the respondent's powers do not end on the applicant's discharge from bankruptcy and he referred, by way of example, to the power of examination in s 81 of the Act , and the continuing obligation on the applicant to assist the respondent under s 152 of the Act . Those matters may be acknowledged, but they are insufficient to suggest that in not withdrawing his objections the respondent should be subject to an order of the Court under s 178. Secondly, the applicant submitted that the respondent had not administered the estate with the diligence required of a reasonably competent trustee in bankruptcy. In the previous proceeding, Lander J made a number of observations about the applicant's failure to co-operate with the respondent in a way which would facilitate the timely administration of his estate (at [5]-[21] and [73]-[92]). I refer to and rely on those findings. Since the previous proceedings the applicant took no steps to provide his income tax returns until 6 March 2008 and he has not provided any group certificates or assessments to the respondent for the financial year ended 30 June 2005 or since. He has been examined on a number of occasions, and on the last occasion, being 31 August 2006, the respondent was still asking the applicant for details of his income. Thereafter, the applicant made no immediate inquiries for his income tax returns allegedly because of health problems. In those circumstances, the greater part of any delay has been caused by the applicant, and, if there has been any delay by the respondent, it is not of such a nature to overcome the other reasons supporting the respondent's decision not to withdraw the objections.

60 In conclusion, the first ground in the fourth notice of objection and the ground in the fifth notice of objection have not been substantially complied with. In those circumstances, the application should be dismissed. In the alternative, further investigations into the applicant's income since the commencement of his bankruptcy, or at least from 2004 to date, are warranted and that conclusion, when considered with other discretionary matters, in turn leads to the conclusion that the application should be dismissed. Before identifying those other discretionary considerations, I should deal with the second ground in the fourth notice of objection.

61 The second ground of objection in the fourth notice of objection is based on s 149D(1)(f) of the Act and is the failure by the applicant to make payments he was liable to pay under s 139ZG. This ground was the subject of a good deal of evidence but only brief submissions from counsel for the respective parties. As I understand it, it is common ground that as at the date of the fourth notice of objection, that is, 14 July 2004, the applicant was liable to pay the respondent the sum of $4,217.67 by way of income contribution, that is, under s 139ZG. It is common ground that by letter dated 28 November 2004 the applicant forwarded the sum of $4,217.67 to the respondent stating that he wished to discharge that liability. The respondent accepted the payment and the applicant submitted that the liability was thereby discharged. The respondent contended that he was entitled to and did apply the money in partial discharge of the applicant's liability to the respondent in the sum of $10,560 and that the liability for $4,217.67 for income contribution remains extant.

79 I summarise my conclusions as follows. The applicant has not substantially complied with the first ground in the fourth notice of objection and the ground in the fifth notice of objection. In addition, discretionary reasons favour allowing the bankruptcy to continue. In the alternative, the applicant has not provided to the respondent sufficient information to enable him to perform properly his obligations to make income contribution assessments and the evidence establishes that further inquiries and investigations are warranted particularly for the period from 2004 to date. The Family Court proceedings mean that there is a prospect of a dividend being paid to creditors. It is true that the applicant will remain bankrupt for eight years and that is a matter which must be taken into account. Nevertheless, as the reasons for judgment of Lander J in the previous proceeding indicate, the delay has largely resulted from the applicant's own conduct. In my opinion, this is not a proper case for an order under s 178.

80 For the above reasons, the application is dismissed. I will hear the parties as to costs and any other orders. 
 I certify that the preceding eighty (80) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

<tocase>Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Nelson (1998) 86 FCR 67</tocase>
<text>35 As far as the objection provisions in the Act are concerned, although a number of the authorities deal with provisions which have since been amended, it seems the basic principles remain the same. They are as follows:
 
1. The power to prevent a discharge from bankruptcy by operation of law by filing a notice of objection is "a great power": Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1983) 69 FLR 424 at 430-431; 50 ALR 253 at 260; Prentice v Wood [2002] FCAFC 48 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296 at 300 [19] - [21] .
 
2. In Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Nelson (1998) 86 FCR 67 the Court referred to s 149C as it then was and concluded that to make an objection a trustee would need to have reasons directed to the purposes and objects of the Act and that the existence of a permissible ground supported by sufficient evidence was a threshold and that there must also be reasons justifying the making of the objections in the particular case. Section 149C has since been amended to insert subs (1A) which excludes the sub-group of ten grounds to which I have previously referred from the operation of s 149C(1)(c) (see [21] above). It is not necessary for me to consider whether this amendment might affect the question of whether all the reasoning in Nelson should be applied to the amended provisions because there is no challenge in this case to the respondent's decision to make the objections or the notices of objections themselves.
 
3. Unlike this case, in Wharton v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 96 ; (2001) 107 FCR 28 there was a challenge to a trustee's decision to file a notice of objection and at the time relevant to Weinberg J's decision there were fourteen, not twenty-one, grounds of objection in s 149D(1). Nevertheless, with respect, his Honour's observations at 41 [77] give an insight into the objection procedure:
 
 
 Section 149A is an important provision. It provides a strong incentive to bankrupts to cooperate with their trustees during the administration of their estates. In some circumstances, an incentive of that type is plainly necessary. However, unless the section is construed in a sensible manner, it is capable of operating oppressively. It is reasonable to assume that trustees who make requests for information from bankrupts, including those concerning their income, will make due allowance for what might be regarded as the ordinary exigencies of life. Requests for information are often not met in as timely a manner as they ought to be. Some delays may be regarded as excusable while others will properly give rise to the filing of notices of objection. A bankrupt cannot ignore requests from his or her trustee. A particularly lengthy delay in responding to a request may trigger a notice of objection to discharge which is entirely justifiable. A relatively short delay in answering a request may be a different matter. Section 149D(1)(d) must be construed in the light of the requirement in s 149B(2)(b) that the trustee must believe that the filing of a notice of objection is the only way to induce the bankrupt to discharge his duties under the Act . It is plainly a course of last resort.
 
 

4. In Thomas v Donnelly [1997] FCA 1142 , Emmett J considered the trustee's discretionary power under s 149J to consider and make a decision as to whether, in particular circumstances, he should withdraw an objection which he has lodged. His Honour made the point that a trustee is an officer of the Court and that in exercising his powers and functions, he is required to take into account not only the interest of creditors but also the interest of the bankrupt and of the community generally. His Honour also said:
 
 
 In exercising his powers, the trustee should have in mind the object of enforcing careful and moral conduct on the part of the debtor and to uphold the commercial morality of the community.
 
 

 In Macchia , French J cited with approval authority to the effect that trustees are appointed to administer the estates of bankrupts in the interests of creditors and, in so doing, to have regard also to the interests of bankrupts (at 116 [38]).
 
5. In a case such as the present one where there has been a failure to provide information or material and to pay money and there is no challenge to the decision to make objections on those grounds, a trustee, on being asked to consider a withdrawal of objections, will consider the following:
 
 
 (1) Whether the obligation has now been complied with or, at least, substantially complied with. Literal compliance may not in fact be possible. The ground in s 149D(1)(e) provides an example. The twenty-one day period referred to in s139U(1) is likely to have expired long ago. I will refer to substantial compliance as embracing the concept of compliance in a practical sense with the relevant obligation. It is difficult to see how a trustee could be criticised for refusing to withdraw an objection that had not been substantially complied with.
 (2) Even if an objection has been substantially complied with, the trustee has a discretion not to withdraw it. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the interests of the bankrupt's creditors and the interest of the bankrupt and the community generally. The discretion should not be exercised to punish the bankrupt. Despite legislative amendments since Nelson the principle that a notice of objection should not be filed to penalise a bankrupt (at 82) remains valid and in the same way a trustee should not refuse to withdraw an objection for the purpose of penalising a bankrupt.
 The most important consideration in the exercise of the discretion whether to withdraw an objection will be whether there is utility in the administration of the estate continuing. If there is utility in the administration of the estate continuing, then even though a properly based objection has been substantially complied with it may be appropriate for the trustee to refuse to withdraw the objection. In exercising the discretion it is likely that it will be appropriate for a trustee to consider a range of matters. It is not possible to state those matters exhaustively. Some of the matters which seem to me to be relevant are the nature and extent of the benefit which may accrue to the estate if the administration continues, any connection between the ground of objection and delay in the timely administration of the estate, delay by the trustee in the timely administration of the estate for reasons unrelated to the ground of objection and any connection between the ground of objection and a need by the trustee to conduct further inquiries and investigations. It would also be appropriate for the trustee to have regard to the interests of the bankrupt and the overall period of the bankruptcy. In a proper case, it will also be appropriate for the trustee to take into account the fact that he retains certain powers, or is owed certain obligations by a bankrupt, even after the bankrupt's discharge from bankruptcy. Examples are the power to examine and require the production of books in s 81 , and the obligation in s 152 of the Act . Section 152 is in the following terms: 
 
 s 152 A discharged bankrupt must, even though discharged, give such assistance as the trustee reasonably requires in the realization and distribution of such of his or her property as is vested in the trustee. Penalty: Imprisonment for 6 months. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One factor which the respondent advanced as a factor he could rely on to support his decision not to withdraw the objections was the fact that, if not discharged, there will be a further CAP and it was said that that might produce a contribution for the benefit of creditors. The CAPs cease at the end of bankruptcy although an assessment may be made at any time: s 139WA. The discharge of a bankrupt from a bankruptcy does not release the bankrupt from liability to pay an amount to the trustee under s 139ZG(1). In my opinion, the fact that there will be a further CAP is not a factor to be taken into account. It is a consequence of an administration continuing, but not a reason to continue it. I do not think the Full Court of this Court said anything to the contrary in Prentice v Wood [2002] FCAFC 48 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296.

36 I have not been able to find any authority which deals with s 139U of the Act . Two matters, however, should be noted. First, the reference in s 149D(1)(e) to s 139U may only be a reference to the obligation in subs (1)(a) to provide a statement containing certain particulars and other matters and not (in addition) the obligation in subs (1)(b) to provide books. That would seem to follow from the fact that s 149D(1)(e) refers only to a bankrupt's failure to disclose "any particulars of income or expected income as required by ... section 139U". Secondly, there was no debate before me as to whether a bankrupt only complied with s 139U if the statement containing certain particulars and other matters and the books are accurate. That type of issue was discussed by Weinberg J in Wharton in a different context, namely, an objection based on s 149D(1)(d). The important word used in paragraph (d) is "information". For reasons I will give I do not need to consider the issue in the context of s 149D(1)(e) and s 139U.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/7.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The principles which govern an application under s 178 are as follows:
 
1. Section 178 confers a "supervisory jurisdiction over the conduct of the trustee": Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124 at 132 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The section confers on the Court a very wide discretion: McGoldrick v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 636 ; (1993) 47 FCR 547 at 552-553.
 
2. It is not necessary for an applicant for relief under the section to show that the trustee's decision was absurd, or unreasonable or taken in bad faith. The Court has a wide discretion to make such order as seems appropriate in the circumstances of the case: Re Tyndall; Ex parte Official Receiver (1977) 30 FLR 6 at 9-10; [1977] FCA 15 ; 17 ALR 182 at 186 per Deane J. At the same time, the Court will be slow to make orders which will have the effect of interfering in the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate and, in cases involving an exercise of business or commercial judgment, will place considerable weight on the trustee's decision. Furthermore, a Court will not intervene under s 178 simply because the Judge forms a different view from that of the trustee.
 
3. An order may be made under s 178 even if the trustee's decision was correct on the material before him, if, for example, additional material is put before the Court.
 
4. The power to make orders under s 178 is not necessarily ousted by the presence of an alternative remedy. In any particular case, the presence of an alternative remedy may lead to an argument that the alternative procedure is a code for correcting alleged errors by a trustee. That was a possibility discussed by the Full Court of this Court in McGoldrick , although the argument did not succeed in that case. In almost all cases, the presence of an alternative remedy will be relevant to the exercise of a discretion under s 178 not to make an order. There is, with respect, an illuminating discussion of the relevant principles by French J in Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101. 
 
Counsel for the respondent in this case referred to McGoldrick and the argument that an alternative review procedure might be construed as a code excluding relief under s 178 , but by the time of their respective closing submissions both parties accepted that there is no alternative review procedure which might affect this application either as a matter of law or as a matter of discretion. The position taken by the parties is correct because the review procedure in Part VII , Division 2, Subdivision C relates to a trustee's decision to file a notice of objection (s 149K(1)) ; not a decision (or act or omission) by a trustee not to withdraw an objection.

35 As far as the objection provisions in the Act are concerned, although a number of the authorities deal with provisions which have since been amended, it seems the basic principles remain the same. They are as follows:
 
1. The power to prevent a discharge from bankruptcy by operation of law by filing a notice of objection is "a great power": Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1983) 69 FLR 424 at 430-431; 50 ALR 253 at 260; Prentice v Wood [2002] FCAFC 48 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296 at 300 [19] - [21] .
 
2. In Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Nelson (1998) 86 FCR 67 the Court referred to s 149C as it then was and concluded that to make an objection a trustee would need to have reasons directed to the purposes and objects of the Act and that the existence of a permissible ground supported by sufficient evidence was a threshold and that there must also be reasons justifying the making of the objections in the particular case. Section 149C has since been amended to insert subs (1A) which excludes the sub-group of ten grounds to which I have previously referred from the operation of s 149C(1)(c) (see [21] above). It is not necessary for me to consider whether this amendment might affect the question of whether all the reasoning in Nelson should be applied to the amended provisions because there is no challenge in this case to the respondent's decision to make the objections or the notices of objections themselves.
 
3. Unlike this case, in Wharton v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [2001] FCA 96 ; (2001) 107 FCR 28 there was a challenge to a trustee's decision to file a notice of objection and at the time relevant to Weinberg J's decision there were fourteen, not twenty-one, grounds of objection in s 149D(1). Nevertheless, with respect, his Honour's observations at 41 [77] give an insight into the objection procedure:
 
 
 Section 149A is an important provision. It provides a strong incentive to bankrupts to cooperate with their trustees during the administration of their estates. In some circumstances, an incentive of that type is plainly necessary. However, unless the section is construed in a sensible manner, it is capable of operating oppressively. It is reasonable to assume that trustees who make requests for information from bankrupts, including those concerning their income, will make due allowance for what might be regarded as the ordinary exigencies of life. Requests for information are often not met in as timely a manner as they ought to be. Some delays may be regarded as excusable while others will properly give rise to the filing of notices of objection. A bankrupt cannot ignore requests from his or her trustee. A particularly lengthy delay in responding to a request may trigger a notice of objection to discharge which is entirely justifiable. A relatively short delay in answering a request may be a different matter. Section 149D(1)(d) must be construed in the light of the requirement in s 149B(2)(b) that the trustee must believe that the filing of a notice of objection is the only way to induce the bankrupt to discharge his duties under the Act . It is plainly a course of last resort.
 
 

4. In Thomas v Donnelly [1997] FCA 1142 , Emmett J considered the trustee's discretionary power under s 149J to consider and make a decision as to whether, in particular circumstances, he should withdraw an objection which he has lodged. His Honour made the point that a trustee is an officer of the Court and that in exercising his powers and functions, he is required to take into account not only the interest of creditors but also the interest of the bankrupt and of the community generally. His Honour also said:
 
 
 In exercising his powers, the trustee should have in mind the object of enforcing careful and moral conduct on the part of the debtor and to uphold the commercial morality of the community.
 
 

 In Macchia , French J cited with approval authority to the effect that trustees are appointed to administer the estates of bankrupts in the interests of creditors and, in so doing, to have regard also to the interests of bankrupts (at 116 [38]).
 
5. In a case such as the present one where there has been a failure to provide information or material and to pay money and there is no challenge to the decision to make objections on those grounds, a trustee, on being asked to consider a withdrawal of objections, will consider the following:
 
 
 (1) Whether the obligation has now been complied with or, at least, substantially complied with. Literal compliance may not in fact be possible. The ground in s 149D(1)(e) provides an example. The twenty-one day period referred to in s139U(1) is likely to have expired long ago. I will refer to substantial compliance as embracing the concept of compliance in a practical sense with the relevant obligation. It is difficult to see how a trustee could be criticised for refusing to withdraw an objection that had not been substantially complied with.
 (2) Even if an objection has been substantially complied with, the trustee has a discretion not to withdraw it. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the interests of the bankrupt's creditors and the interest of the bankrupt and the community generally. The discretion should not be exercised to punish the bankrupt. Despite legislative amendments since Nelson the principle that a notice of objection should not be filed to penalise a bankrupt (at 82) remains valid and in the same way a trustee should not refuse to withdraw an objection for the purpose of penalising a bankrupt.
 The most important consideration in the exercise of the discretion whether to withdraw an objection will be whether there is utility in the administration of the estate continuing. If there is utility in the administration of the estate continuing, then even though a properly based objection has been substantially complied with it may be appropriate for the trustee to refuse to withdraw the objection. In exercising the discretion it is likely that it will be appropriate for a trustee to consider a range of matters. It is not possible to state those matters exhaustively. Some of the matters which seem to me to be relevant are the nature and extent of the benefit which may accrue to the estate if the administration continues, any connection between the ground of objection and delay in the timely administration of the estate, delay by the trustee in the timely administration of the estate for reasons unrelated to the ground of objection and any connection between the ground of objection and a need by the trustee to conduct further inquiries and investigations. It would also be appropriate for the trustee to have regard to the interests of the bankrupt and the overall period of the bankruptcy. In a proper case, it will also be appropriate for the trustee to take into account the fact that he retains certain powers, or is owed certain obligations by a bankrupt, even after the bankrupt's discharge from bankruptcy. Examples are the power to examine and require the production of books in s 81 , and the obligation in s 152 of the Act . Section 152 is in the following terms: 
 
 s 152 A discharged bankrupt must, even though discharged, give such assistance as the trustee reasonably requires in the realization and distribution of such of his or her property as is vested in the trustee. Penalty: Imprisonment for 6 months. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One factor which the respondent advanced as a factor he could rely on to support his decision not to withdraw the objections was the fact that, if not discharged, there will be a further CAP and it was said that that might produce a contribution for the benefit of creditors. The CAPs cease at the end of bankruptcy although an assessment may be made at any time: s 139WA. The discharge of a bankrupt from a bankruptcy does not release the bankrupt from liability to pay an amount to the trustee under s 139ZG(1). In my opinion, the fact that there will be a further CAP is not a factor to be taken into account. It is a consequence of an administration continuing, but not a reason to continue it. I do not think the Full Court of this Court said anything to the contrary in Prentice v Wood [2002] FCAFC 48 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/636.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The principles which govern an application under s 178 are as follows:
 
1. Section 178 confers a "supervisory jurisdiction over the conduct of the trustee": Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124 at 132 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The section confers on the Court a very wide discretion: McGoldrick v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 636 ; (1993) 47 FCR 547 at 552-553.
 
2. It is not necessary for an applicant for relief under the section to show that the trustee's decision was absurd, or unreasonable or taken in bad faith. The Court has a wide discretion to make such order as seems appropriate in the circumstances of the case: Re Tyndall; Ex parte Official Receiver (1977) 30 FLR 6 at 9-10; [1977] FCA 15 ; 17 ALR 182 at 186 per Deane J. At the same time, the Court will be slow to make orders which will have the effect of interfering in the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate and, in cases involving an exercise of business or commercial judgment, will place considerable weight on the trustee's decision. Furthermore, a Court will not intervene under s 178 simply because the Judge forms a different view from that of the trustee.
 
3. An order may be made under s 178 even if the trustee's decision was correct on the material before him, if, for example, additional material is put before the Court.
 
4. The power to make orders under s 178 is not necessarily ousted by the presence of an alternative remedy. In any particular case, the presence of an alternative remedy may lead to an argument that the alternative procedure is a code for correcting alleged errors by a trustee. That was a possibility discussed by the Full Court of this Court in McGoldrick , although the argument did not succeed in that case. In almost all cases, the presence of an alternative remedy will be relevant to the exercise of a discretion under s 178 not to make an order. There is, with respect, an illuminating discussion of the relevant principles by French J in Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101.

<text>74 As to the third issue, neither counsel made submissions about whether the respondent was entitled at law to use the sum of $4,217.67 to discharge a liability other than the liability identified by the payor. It is far from clear that he was: Halsbury's Laws of England (4 th ed) Vol 9 [956]-[960]. The applicant's counsel put a different argument and that was that even if the respondent was legally entitled to do what he did the respondent as an officer of the Court was bound to act fairly and he had not acted fairly by purporting to allocate the payment to a liability other than that identified by the payor. The applicant's counsel sought to invoke the principle in In re Condon; Ex parte James (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609 (see Re Clark (a bankrupt); Ex parte the trustee of the property of the bankrupt v Texaco Ltd [1975] 1 All ER 453; [1975] 1 WLR 559). I do not think that there is any room for the application of that principle in this case. The payment was not made by a third party but by the bankrupt and the payment was not made in circumstances of unfairness leading to the enrichment of the estate.</text>
