<tocase>D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<text>9 The principles to be applied in dealing with an application such as the present are laid down in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397.

10 In my opinion the learned Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by this Court. Moreover, were leave to be granted to appeal, there is no prospect that the applicant could succeed on the grounds on which he seeks to rely.

11 The application should be refused with costs.
 I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Court.
