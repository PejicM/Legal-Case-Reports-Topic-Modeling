<tocase>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Limited v President, Councillors and Ratepayers of the Shire of Hasting [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/40.html</AustLII>
<text>81 Although no submissions were made in relation to the issue of the applicability of the doctrine of implied terms in respect of Mr McCarron's AWA, there is no apparent reason why such doctrine should not apply to imply a term that the operational reasons referred to in clause 30 of the AWA be 'genuine operation reasons' determined after proper inquiry. The doctrine which applies only where it is necessary to give efficacy to an agreement, was considered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Limited v President, Councillors and Ratepayers of the Shire of Hasting [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266. Had the parties applied their minds to the question of whether a proper assessment would be made to determine whether a total ban on leave was necessary or that only genuine reasons could justify a ban, the result would have been so obvious that it 'goes without saying' (see BP Refinery 180 CLR 283). Whilst the doctrine of implied terms is not applicable to an industrial award (see Byrne v Australian Airlines Limited [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410), the terms under which Mr McCarron was employed was an agreement, and not an award. It is not necessary to decide this issue in view of the finding that there were no operational reasons which justified the ban on the NDCP thereby resulting in a breach of clause 30. If it were necessary in order to give efficacy to the AWA to imply a term requiring the provision that 'operational requirements' means 'genuine operational requirements', the Court would imply such a term, and would find that such implied term was breached.</text>

<text>52 The standard of proof required to determine whether the reason for conduct was prohibited under s 793 is to be considered in accordance with the principle derived from the judgment of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362: see The Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers [2000] FCA 710 ; (2000) 100 FCR 454 at 464 where Einfeld J said 
 
 I think that in dealing with these types of civil offences some standard of proof above mere satisfaction on the probabilities is appropriate. The Court is in any event bound by s 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) to take into account the nature of the cause of action, the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged in determining whether it is reasonably satisfied that the matter has been proved.</text>

<text>47 The High Court in Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at 18, referring to s 298K(1)(c) of the Act being the predecessor to the current s 792(1)(c), said:
 
 par (c) is a broad additional category which covers not only legal injury but any adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee before the conduct in question. 

See also Branson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia (2007) 157 FCR 329 where her Honour considered the scope of the meaning of a prejudicial alteration of an employee's position within the meaning of s 298K(1)(c) of the unamended Act.</text>

<text>42 With respect to the submission of the CPSU and Mr McCarron that the announcement of the leave ban constituted a threat of prohibited conduct within the meaning of s 793(2) of the Act, the OEA submits that as the ban on leave was not prohibited, its announcement could not have been a threat. Further, the OEA submits that the announcement of the leave ban did not constitute a threat as it did not menace or warn of an intention to inflict harm. The OEA relies upon the observations of Finkelstein J in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2000) 99 IR 238.</text>

<tocase>Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 107 FCR 93</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/267.html</AustLII>
<text>45 The Full Court in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 107 FCR 93 considered the equivalent of s 792(1)(b) in the previous legislation and stated at page 100:
 
 It is sufficient for present purposes to say that if the prejudicial alteration is real and substantial, rather than merely possible or hypothetical, it will answer the description in s 298K(1)(c).

50 The Court is satisfied that the conduct of imposing the ban did alter the position of Mr McCarron to his prejudice as provided by s 792(1)(c). The effect of the ban upon Mr McCarron was real and substantial and not merely hypothetical: see Community and Public Sector Union [2001] FCA 267 ; 107 FCR 93. A further question remains, namely was such ban imposed for a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 of the Act?

51 To satisfy section 793(1) of the Act conduct prescribed in s 792 must be carried out, inter alia, because the employee is a member of an industrial association. Mr McCarron was a member of the CPSU and the NDCP was carried out under the auspices of the ACTU with the full support of the CPSU. Ms Skarratt and Mr McIlwain were aware that employees in the OEA were union members and that the NDCP was organised by the ACTU.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/176.html</AustLII>
<text>43 The OEA submits that leave was approved for Mr McCarron after orders of the Full Court in CPSU, The Commonwealth and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCAFC 176. It is submitted that because Mr McCarron attended the NDCP, his position was not altered to his prejudice.

44 As to alleged breaches of the AWA, it is submitted that Clause 30 of the AWA does not provide an absolute entitlement of flex leave for an employee. Clause 30(a) stipulated that flex leave was 'subject to operational requirements' . Clause 3 of the Policy required 'operational requirements and needs of individuals' to be taken into account when an employee and the manager were settling working arrangements, work patterns and flex-leave arrangements. Clause 1 of the Policy required managers and supervisors to
 
 have regard to the operational requirements of the area, the impact of granting the leave on clients and other members of the workgroup and the personal needs of the employee 

when approving the use of annual leave. The OEA submits that it had regard to its operational requirements when determining to refuse further flex leave and annual leave for participation in the rally.</text>

<text>54 The motivation for the ban is also a relevant consideration. In Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 the Full Court considered the interpretation of s 298K of the unamended Act (the equivalent of s 793 of the current Act). At [164] Merkel J observed that s 298K was not concerned
 
 with the cause of the prejudicial conduct. Rather, it is concerned with the employer's reason or reasons for engaging in that conduct. [emphasis in the original]</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/899.html</AustLII>
<text>55 The Court is required to determine whether there is a causal connection between the conduct of the OEA which altered Mr McCarron's position to his prejudice, and the status of Mr McCarron as a union member under s 793(1) of the Act: see Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at [294] - [296] per Nicholson J. An analysis of the authorities establishes that the Courts have interpreted s 793(1) of the Act as requiring the dominant or immediate purpose of the conduct to be considered and not the ultimate purpose in determining the motivation for the prohibited conduct. Such approach has been applied in statutory interpretation of other statutes: see for example Wribass Pty Limited v Swallow (1979) 38 FLR 92 at 104-106 and Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Limited v Australasian Meat Industry Employee's Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 349 which involved the interpretation of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</text>

<tocase>McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (2006) 154 IR 111</tocase>
<text>53 The ban affected all employees in the OEA, whether members of the CPSU or otherwise. However this circumstance does not lead to the conclusion that it was therefore not imposed for a 'prohibited reason'. In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (2006) 154 IR 111 at 355 Greenwood J said:
 
 Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non-prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee. It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost. The question is whether the conduct, from the standpoint of the individual, notwithstanding others, represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose.</text>

<text>46 Ellicott J in Squires v Flight Stewards Association of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155 at 183 said of the words prohibiting an employer from injuring an employee in his employment as referred to in s 188 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth):
 
 The words "injure in his employment" are in the context of s. 5 words of wide import. I do not regard them as referring only to financial injury or injury involving the deprivation of rights which the employee has under a contract of service. They are, in my view, applicable to any circumstances where an employee in the course of his employment is treated substantially differently to the manner in which he or she is ordinarily treated and where that treatment can be seen to be injurious or prejudicial.</text>

<tocase>Tasmanian Development and Resources v Martin (2000) 97 IR 66</tocase>
<text>79 Mr McCarron was entitled to have his leave applications properly considered by the OEA pursuant to the terms of his AWA. Pursuant to clause 30 of the AWA the approval of flex leave is subject to operational requirements. However the existence of operational requirements must be demonstrated and must be genuine and reasonable. The decision of the Full Court in Tasmanian Development and Resources v Martin (2000) 97 IR 66 at [26] provides support for a finding that there must be a factual basis for a conclusion that there were operational requirements which necessitated the ban on leave. The reasons advanced for operational requirements as referred to above amount to no more than, at the highest, an apprehension of staff shortages on the NDCP. Such fear was not based upon any enquiries of past experiences, nor any genuine assessment of the real staffing needs on the NDCP. Had enquiries of the relevant managers been made, the decision to impose the ban would at least have had a foundation. Such enquiries however would have revealed that a total ban, based on the experience of the two prior occasions, would not be necessary. Accordingly, the reasons advanced in support of the decision do not constitute a sufficient basis for imposing the ban on leave. It follows that by imposing such ban the OEA breached clause 30 of Mr McCarron's AWA with the OEA.

80 The CPSU and Mr McCarron also claimed that clause 33 of the AWA between Mr McCarron and the OEA was breached. The text of clause 33 is couched as a statement of the role of the relevant manager in ensuring that flex-leave arrangements provided by clause 30 are made available to employees. The OEA made no submissions on this issue, and in view of the Court's finding that clause 30 has been breached, it is not necessary to determine whether clause 33 creates a contractual right, and if so, whether it has been breached.</text>
