<tocase>Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685</tocase>
<text>In relation to Ms George's application for a stay of his Honour's Orders, while I note the principles arising from such cases as Cambridge Credit Corporation (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 brought to my attention by the first, second, third and fourth respondents, I consider that a refusal to order a stay would substantially frustrate any success Ms George would have should her appeal to the Full Court be successful. Accordingly, it is for this reason that I am prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of Ms George and order a stay of the orders of his Honour of 9 February 2009 numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 pending delivery of judgment in Ms George's appeal. I am not prepared to make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 2 of her amended Notice of Motion as has been observed by both Dowsett J and myself during the course of these proceedings, if there is an error in the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court it is for the Federal Court to review on appeal.

Further, as I indicated to the parties at the hearing before me, I am not prepared to make the orders sought by Ms George in paras 4, 5, 6 and 7 of her amended Notice of Motion before me (TS 5 March 2009 86 ll 28-30). Instead, the hearing of those paragraphs is adjourned to a date to be fixed.

Finally, I do not consider that it is appropriate that I make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 3 of her amended Notice of Motion, being an order by which she apparently seeks recognition of her reliance on certain material and on Supreme Court Orders. Nor do I consider it either appropriate or desirable that I should make an order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 8 of her amended Notice of Motion, being referable to proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland.
 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

<tocase>Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1593.html</AustLII>
<text>An appeal from orders of a Federal Magistrate pursuant to s 17A Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth), being a summary judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (cf observations of Buchanan J in Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593) , requires leave of this Court pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

In the amended notice of motion the applicant seeks the following orders: Under Federal Court Act 1976 s 29(1) request a stay on court orders dated 9 February 2009 numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court matter file number 3747/2008.
 Request a stay on hearing the notice of appeal dated 18 February 2009 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court matter file number 3747/2008.
 The appellant relies upon affidavits dated 5 March 2009, 14 February 2009 in the name of Lauren Kay George for the above matter and Supreme Court Orders dated 18 February 2009 and transcripts dated 9 February 2009 and 18 February 2009.
 The appellant makes application to the court under ss 303 , 29 , 178 , 30 (1)(a)(b), 149 (4), 149J of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .

The appellant be deemed to have been discharged from bankruptcy on 25 February 2009 under s 149(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .</text>

<text>In the application Ms George seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 9 February 2009 and his Honour's Orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 ( Fletcher v George &amp; Ors (No 6) [2009] FMCA 69). The orders of the Federal Magistrate in those proceedings were made pursuant to s 17A Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth), which provides:

(a) the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and 
 
(b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.
 
 (2) The Federal Magistrates Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: 

(a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 
(b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: 

(a) hopeless; or
 
(b) bound to fail;
 
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.
 (4) This section does not limit any powers that the Federal Magistrates Court has apart from this section.</text>
