<text>40 Section 75B for present purposes deems a person to be involved in a contravention of (inter alia) Part V (which includes s 52 and s 59 by a corporation if that person "has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention": see s 75B(1)(c). This, as I earlier noted, is the vehicle relied upon by the applicants to impose liability on Bell and Sladojevic under s 82 of the TP Act in respect of the contraventions alleged against Tiltform Licensing by virtue of their conduct: see Wheeler Grace &amp; Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) 11 ATPR 40-940. Section 75B does not require that the participant knew he or she was participating in a contravention of the Act. What, though, is required is actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666 ff.</text>

<tocase>Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverall [2001] Ch 340</tocase>
<text>47 I equally should comment on Sladojevic's relationship with Benson. This relationship needs to be considered bearing two matters in mind first, Sladojevic's tendency to domineer; and, secondly, his power over Tiltform Australia by virtue of the licence agreements Tiltform Licensing had with it. While Benson was, in the relevant period, within Sladojevic's power vis-&agrave;-vis investments to be made in Tiltform Australia, the evidence is that at that time their relationship was cordial. I accept that Benson readily accepted and acted upon proposals and suggestions of Sladojevic relating to securing investment in Tiltform Australia. But I do not accept, and it has not been suggested, that Sladojevic was in essence a "shadow director" of Tiltform Australia: cf Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverall [2001] Ch 340 at 354; Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53. The evidence is that Benson had and relied upon his own financial advisers in relation to the formation and their operation of Tiltform Australia and that he was experienced in the conduct of his own businesses. I do not accept that he was simply Sladojevic's cipher despite Parker's occasional attempts to paint him as such.</text>

<tocase>Hughes Aircraft Systems International v AirServices Australia (1977) 76 FCR 151</tocase>
<text>201 By way of background to what I have to say I would observe the following. It is trite to say the question whether conduct in a given instance is of the s 52/s 995 proscribed character is to be determined having regard to all the relevant circumstances. Silence can render conduct misleading or deceptive if in all the circumstance the party complaining of the non-disclosure was reasonably entitled to expect that if the matters in question existed, had occurred, or were contemplated, they would be disclosed: see Hughes Aircraft Systems International v AirServices Australia (1977) 76 FCR 151 at 198-199 and the cases there discussed.

202 The seeming background relied upon to found a "duty to disclose" in this matter (at least for the purposes of the misleading or deceptive conduct claims) was Parker's claimed trust in Bell as a fellow accountant who was the accountant for Tiltform Licensing and whom he dealt with as such.

203 The evidence concerning Bell in this regard is slight. In Sladojevic's original letter to Murabito agreeing to the 2 June 2000 meeting Bell (who was to be in attendance) was described as "an integral part of our organisation and responsible for the strategic planning of our organisation".

357 In the Rawley matter I indicated that the question whether conduct in a given instance is proscribed by s 52/s995 is to be determined having regard to all the relevant circumstances. Silence can render conduct misleading or deceptive if in all the circumstance the party complaining of the non-disclosure was reasonably entitled to expect that if the matters in question existed, had occurred, or were contemplated, they would be disclosed: see Hughes Aircraft Systems International at 198-199.

358 Seemingly the "duty to disclose" in Chehade's case was founded in his "trust in Robert and Geoff". I have earlier commented on that trust. I would simply reiterate that to have trust in another person for whatever reason (be it reasonable or fanciful) does not as of course result in the imposition of an obligation on that other to act in accordance with the dictates of that trust. If such trust is to have any significance at all in a particular matter (I exclude from this relationships of undue influence), there must ordinarily be reason in the relationship of the parties either in that matter or arising from past or present dealings that properly could give rise in the circumstances to the expectation that the disclosure of the information in question would be made if it was known to the trusted party.

359 The short answer to the Chehade case is that neither Bell nor Sladojevic on my findings so conducted themselves in relation to Chehade's investment decision that they could properly be expected to disclose information to Chehade. As I will indicate below, I am satisfied Chehade did it his own way. He was the author of his own harm. His trust may have been in Bell and Chehade making the investment a profitable one given their commitment to the Tiltform enterprise and its success. That was not a trust that could author a liability of the type claimed here.</text>

<text>210 Given that the primary relief sought is damages under s 82 of the TP Act or, in the alternative, s 1325 of the Corporations Law, the critical issue in this case is whether any or all of the contravening conduct materially contributed to the loss the applicants' claim they suffered in consequence of their making their investment. In this particular setting the applicants accept, properly, that it is for them ultimately to prove contravening conduct was an inducement to their making of the investment in Tiltform Australia: see Lam v Austintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd (1989) 97 FLR 458 at 477-478; albeit it need not be the sole inducement: Kabwand Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd (1989) 11 ATPR 40-950 at 50,378; see also Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree trading as R Tambree and Associates [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 224 CLR 627 at [32] . As s 82 makes plain, the loss or damage suffered must be "by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of [s 52]": see Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525. Notwithstanding the submissions made by Sladojevic on the potential difference between s 82 and s 1325 in this regard because of the former's use of "by" and the latter's "because of", this as will be seen is not a difference I need explore here given my findings.</text>

<tocase>Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd (1993) 41 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>211 It is unnecessary to enlarge on the above in any detail. It is well accepted. Because I have found contraventions to have occurred, it is helpful still to be reminded of the observations of the Full Court of this Court in Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 235:
 
 "A finding that a misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did. Consistently with that finding, it may be that, on the balance of probabilities, a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation. Assuming a non-trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation, then it may be actionable. 
 
 Ultimately, the 'causative threshold' beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss, will be a question of judgment. This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd (supra) and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418-419 and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ATPR 49,849. (See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 84 ALR 700 at 712). But the mere possibility that a misrepresentation might have induced a course of action by the representee can never of itself attach liability under s 82 to the making of it."</text>

<tocase>Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 193</tocase>
<text>212 I would also note, because of their present relevance, the observations of Gummow J in Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 193 at 241:
 
 "It is, of course, fundamental that s 52 is not designed for the benefit of persons who fail, in the circumstances of the case, to take reasonable care of their own interests ..."

213 To anticipate what I will say, while the nature of the representations made by Bell and Sladojevic were likely to induce reliance, any inference that the applicants acted on those representations is negatived in the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied that those representations played no part in their decision to invest. I regard the evidence given to the contrary by Parker, Lee and Murabito as unreliable. In each of their cases it reflected at best reconstruction and rationalisation resulting in the creation of a collective memory. Their decision was one in which Parker was influential. They backed their own judgment as to the prospects for the Tiltform technology and Tiltform Australia. In so doing they assumed a risk that adequate working capital would be secured and the short term cash flow problem overcome. They did not rely upon Bell or Sladojevic. They knew, or ought to have known, through Parker, that Bell's "$2 million" had not been raised. Their investment decision was not relevantly influenced by Sladojevic' s 7 August letter.

214 I have, in outlining the evidence for the misleading or deceptive conduct claims, referred not only to the context in which those representations were to be evaluated for the purpose of determining their falsity or otherwise but also to the context in which their causative significance is to be judged. The following are my reasons for the conclusion I have foreshadowed.

215 There are five matters of general significance to which reference should be made at the outset as they bear in various ways on the resolution of the present question. First, the relevant events occurred over a relatively short period, i.e. from 2 June to 9 August, and at a time when both Tiltform Australia was in its infancy and the national licence system had not been established. Secondly, the contact between Parker and Lee on the one hand and Bell and Sladojevic on the other in this period was quite limited. Less so the contact between Lee, though not Parker, and Benson. Thirdly, all of the above persons, it can be inferred, were aware that in order to succeed Tiltform Australia would have to have sufficient working capital to address both licence fees and investment in formwork. The licence agreements and the disclosure documents made this clear. Thirdly, there was at the above time a considerable level of enthusiasm being demonstrated for the Tiltform technology, its use in the construction industry and in its profit making potential. Bell and Sladojevic and the WA investors exhibited that enthusiasm. Fourthly, the clear inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the climate in which the negotiations occurred for the WA investment in Tiltform Australia was one in which buoyant expectations were entertained that working capital would be forthcoming. Dawkins advent as "chairman" of Tiltform Australia in late July clearly provided some stimulus to this. Fifthly, the WA investment was made in Tiltform Australia which at the time was, and was known by the WA investors to be, Benson's and his joint venture partner Dr Abraham's company. No investment was being made in Tiltform Licensing. Neither Bell nor Sladojevic held offices in, or were shareholders of, Tiltform Australia although as I will later indicate a claim is brought against them as promoters of that company.

216 It is clear that, from the outset, the directors of the Icon Group Murabito, Palmiero and Lee made their own highly positive business judgment of the virtue and attractions of the Tiltform technology, of its profit making potential and of the advantage of acquiring a licence of it. When Parker was offered participation in the investment opportunity Tiltform WA, he in turn came to share the same positive attitude to the Tiltform "opportunity" after his initial meeting in Adelaide on 2 June with Sladojevic and Bell an attitude contributed to significantly by Sladojevic's explanations etc of the technology. I need not repeat here my findings on that meeting other than to say I do not consider that Parker's projections were discussed in detail with Bell at that meeting, though there was discussion of them. The collective decision of the WA investors to accept the offer of shares in Tiltform WA within ten days of Parker's return from the 2 June meeting provides some evidence, in my view, of their faith in the Tiltform technology.</text>

<text>251 In their written submissions this amalgam is explained in the following way, i.e. Bell and Sladojevic "were promoting the benefit of their licensed product through Tiltform Australia and the Applicants were entitled to consider them as within their confidence". Relying, in particular, upon the terms of the licence agreements with Tiltform Australia, it is said investors in the position of the applicants would know they (i.e. the applicants and Bell and Sladojevic) "were in it together, would believe that the promoters' actions and advices would be as much in their [i.e. the applicants'] interest as their own, and would be made for the mutual purposes of the relationship, and not for the promoters' own self interest". I have indicated earlier in these reasons that the licence agreements contain clauses favourable to the licensor I would instance intrusive powers to control the licencee which are commonly found in exclusive licences involving the use and exploitation of intellectual property: cf Pacific Brands Sports &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 40 ; (2006) 149 FCR 395.</text>

<tocase>Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1984/64.html</AustLII>
<text>252 The above would seem to be suggesting that the licensing agreement constituted a fiduciary relationship between Tiltform Licensing and Tiltform Australia. When I put this, in my view, extraordinary proposition which would turn fiduciary many exclusive dealerships, agencies, intellectual property licences, etc.: cf Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41; counsel for the applicants resiled from it. However, in supplementary submissions, counsel re-embraced the above though with one additional matter of emphasis which is said to be "critical". This is that Sladojevic and Bell "were promoting the take up of shares in Tiltform Australia and advancing the licence that Tiltform Australia had with Tiltform Licensing is (sic) the reason why the proposed investors should seriously consider the investment."

253 So, it is said, from the moment Bell and Sladojevic put forward the Benson Tiltform Australia proposal on 26 June 2000 without Benson's sanction, they were promoting the take up of capital in Tiltform Australia, and they placed themselves in a position where their interest in the share take up conflicted with their duty, seemingly, to act in the joint interest of themselves and the WA investors. I note in passing that the substance of the proposal - the making of an investment in Tiltform Australia had already been discussed at the 24 June 2000 meeting.

254 In any event, it is said in my view surprisingly that this is a case "where the existence of a fiduciary relationship is indicated by the particular licence agreement alone". They point to the licence being an exclusive Australia wide one; to the fact that the position of Tiltform Australia in the Tiltform Group was fundamental to the success of the Group; and to the terms of cl 11.1.2 of the agreement which imposed, in essence, what is commonly encompassed in clauses imposing duties of fair dealing on parties to long term commercial relationships: I refer, purely for reasons of convenience and because good faith itself is not in issue, to Finn, "The Fiduciary Principle" in Youdan (ed) Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts , 10 ff, 1989.

261 It is sufficient to note for present purposes that (i) the distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary relationship is that "its essence, or purpose, is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons" (which, as in the case of a partnership or fiduciary joint venture, can include the fiduciary): see generally Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, at 5-005 ff; (ii) a relationship may be fiduciary in part and non-fiduciary in part: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation , at 97-98 ff; (iii) insofar as the fiduciary relationship is claimed to be founded on mutual trust and confidence, the circumstances must nonetheless be such that the parties to the relationship can reasonably expect loyalty from the other, i.e. the subordination of self interest to joint interest: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd at [11]-[13]; (iv) a person who provides information, suggestion or advice to another upon which that other may reasonably be expected to rely is not for that reason alone necessarily in a fiduciary relationship with that other, though that person will be a fiduciary if the factual matrix is such that that other is in the circumstances reasonably entitled to expect that the information provider, etc is acting in the matter in that other's interest: cf Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (in liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1991) 42 FCR 390; (v) the loyalty obligation imposed on a fiduciary is that he or she cannot 
 
 (a) in any matter within the scope of the fiduciary relationship (see Bertchnell v Equity Trustees Executor &amp; Agency Co Ltd [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408) have a personal interest or an inconsistent engagement with a third party; or 
 (b) use his or her position to own, or to a third party, possible advantage, 

unless this is freely and informedly consented to by the person(s) to whom loyalty is owed, or is authorised by law: Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 199; Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 113; (vii) outside of commercial agency, partnership and trust relationships, care needs to be taken in concluding that commercial parties are in a fiduciary relationship for some or all purposes - not because a commercial relationship cannot be fiduciary, but because such a relationship, commonly, possesses characteristics (e.g. known adversarial interests, the reasonable expectation of self-reliance, etc.) which negative a fiduciary finding: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd , at [2]-[18]; News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 539-541.</text>

<text>256 I have set out what is said to be the basis of the promoters claim at some length for this reason. I have had considerable difficulty in divining precisely what that basis might be. As pleaded, it suggests that the circumstances gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between each of Bell and Sladojevic as promoters of Tiltform Australia on the one hand and the WA investors on the other. The relevant relationships, I would add, were not with Tiltform Australia as such, as is ordinarily the case with promoters of companies: see Tracy v Mandalay Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 9 ; (1953) 88 CLR 215 at 241-242. How the pleaded relationship emerges from the particulars is by no means clear. Presumably its consequence, though, was that Bell and Sladojevic were obliged to act in the interests of the WA investors.</text>

<tocase>United Dominion Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/49.html</AustLII>
<text>257 In written submissions it was suggested initially that they were promoters "because of the clear benefits to be derived by them from a share take up in [Tiltform Australia]". The decision of the High Court in Tracey v Mandalay Pty Ltd , (esp at 241) was in this relied upon for support by way of asserted factual analogy. Those submissions, though, went on to make the assertion of a fiduciary relationship akin to that of proposed joint venturers: United Dominion Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1. This joint venture which could only be said to be between the WA investors and Bell and Sladojevic if the alleged joint venturers' separate corporate entities (i.e. Tiltform Licensing and Tiltform Australia) were disregarded seems to be focussed on Bell's and Sladojevic's obligations as promoters of "the benefit of their (sic) licensed product through Tiltform Australia". I note in passing that no claim is made against Bell and Sladojevic as knowing participants in a breach of duty by Tiltform Licensing. Presumably, in this version of the joint venture, Bell and Sladojevic as fiduciaries were obliged to act in the mutual interest of themselves and the investors within the scope of the proposed venture.

258 In supplementary submissions, the "proposed joint venture" basis continued to be insisted upon, although apparently as an amalgam of the two previous approaches advanced, i.e. they were promoters of Tiltform Australia in the take up of the shares and of the proposed joint venture. The nature of the fiduciary duty owed in this amalgam submission is entirely unclear. Fully informed consent apart, were Bell and Sladojevic obliged to act in the interests of the proposed joint venturers (including themselves) to the exclusion of their own, several personal interests? Or were they obliged to act in the interests of the investors to the exclusion of any personal interest of their own?

259 Because of the difficulties I have in understanding how precisely the promoter fiduciary relationships are said to have been generated and what was the nature of the fiduciary wrongdoing allegedly engaged in in light of the relationships, I will give in relatively short form my own conclusions as to why I consider that there was, in the circumstances, no fiduciary relationship between Bell or Sladojevic and the WA investors. In so doing I have attempted as best I can to take account of the submissions advanced by the applicants.</text>

<tocase>Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/44.html</AustLII>
<text>260 This is not a case which requires any significant elaboration of the basic principles of law governing fiduciary relationships: see generally Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies , Ch 5 (4 th ed 2002); and, on proposed joint ventures having fiduciary characteristics, see Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at 571-576.

261 It is sufficient to note for present purposes that (i) the distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary relationship is that "its essence, or purpose, is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons" (which, as in the case of a partnership or fiduciary joint venture, can include the fiduciary): see generally Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, at 5-005 ff; (ii) a relationship may be fiduciary in part and non-fiduciary in part: Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation , at 97-98 ff; (iii) insofar as the fiduciary relationship is claimed to be founded on mutual trust and confidence, the circumstances must nonetheless be such that the parties to the relationship can reasonably expect loyalty from the other, i.e. the subordination of self interest to joint interest: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd at [11]-[13]; (iv) a person who provides information, suggestion or advice to another upon which that other may reasonably be expected to rely is not for that reason alone necessarily in a fiduciary relationship with that other, though that person will be a fiduciary if the factual matrix is such that that other is in the circumstances reasonably entitled to expect that the information provider, etc is acting in the matter in that other's interest: cf Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (in liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1991) 42 FCR 390; (v) the loyalty obligation imposed on a fiduciary is that he or she cannot 
 
 (a) in any matter within the scope of the fiduciary relationship (see Bertchnell v Equity Trustees Executor &amp; Agency Co Ltd [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408) have a personal interest or an inconsistent engagement with a third party; or 
 (b) use his or her position to own, or to a third party, possible advantage, 

unless this is freely and informedly consented to by the person(s) to whom loyalty is owed, or is authorised by law: Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 199; Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 113; (vii) outside of commercial agency, partnership and trust relationships, care needs to be taken in concluding that commercial parties are in a fiduciary relationship for some or all purposes - not because a commercial relationship cannot be fiduciary, but because such a relationship, commonly, possesses characteristics (e.g. known adversarial interests, the reasonable expectation of self-reliance, etc.) which negative a fiduciary finding: Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd , at [2]-[18]; News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 539-541.

263 It was also obvious to all concerned that to the extent that that exploitation was successful, Tiltform Licensing (and those with interests in it) stood in turn to benefit in virtue of the provisions of the licence agreement. In this sense the two companies shared, i.e. had common but several interests, in the prospering of their business relationship. But there was nothing fiduciary at all about that relationship. The licence agreement required considerable cooperation between the parties as well as ongoing trust and confidence in each other. But it was not for that reason fiduciary: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd at [12]-[16]. Such is the commonplace in relational contracts, i.e. contracts which create an ongoing business relationship. Nonetheless there was nothing in the terms of the contract remotely suggesting that the parties were binding themselves in any way to promote "mutual interests". The agreement was designed to serve the several interests of each, and in this it gave Tiltform Licensing considerable powers over Tiltform Australia to protect its own interests.

264 The licence agreements of themselves created no fiduciary relationship as between Tiltform Licensing and Tiltform Australia. This, though, is not the relationship which, by virtue of the agreement "alone", is said to have been fiduciary. It is at this point that the difficulty with the applicants' submission becomes transparent.

265 It was clearly the case that, in their dealings with the WA investors, Bell and Sladojevic acted in the main on behalf of Tiltform Licensing in relation to a prospective investment in its licensee, Tiltform Australia. It was or should have been obvious to the investors that such was the case and that Tiltform Licensing had manifest interests in the making of the proposed investment. It was not necessary for the investors to have read the licence agreements for them to have reason to know that such was the case, although Parker's evidence is that he read it after returning to Perth from the 2 June meeting and he was aware that Tiltform Licensing's approval was necessary for any change in shareholding. The circumstances were redolent of Tiltform Licensing's own interest both in its relationship with Tiltform Australia and in any investment made in Tiltform Australia. To the extent that Bell and Sladojevic acted and were seen to act for Tiltform Licensing no possible foundation existed for characterising Bell and/or Sladojevic's relationship with the WA investors as fiduciary. As would have been apparent to anyone in the position of the WA investors, Bell and Sladojevic were seeking to protect and advance Tiltform Licensing's interests and, as is commonly the case in commercial dealings, they sought positively to encourage the investment in Tiltform Australia, both by enhancing its attractiveness (by, for example, introducing Dawkins to Benson) and by encouraging (through representations) its being made. The latter action was taken for the immediate benefit of Tiltform Australia, though self-interest was writ large in it.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/52.html</AustLII>
<text>314 It is unnecessary for present purposes to characterise the effect of the stipulated condition, although I am satisfied that in this context it conditioned the performance not the formation of the contract: see Meehan v Jones [1982] HCA 52 ; (1982) 149 CLR 571. It is equally unnecessary, given what later occurred, to express a concluded view on the date on which the contract was made. My own view is that it probably was around the time of, but prior to, the 17 July meeting. What is clear is that it was on foot when the deposit of $10,000 was paid on 7 August. Even if that payment was to be regarded strictly as a deposit, the contract's conditional character was spent shortly thereafter when Chehade paid $50,000 on 25 August 2000 and began employment with Tiltform Australia on 1 September 2000. At best by then, it had become an instalment contract and no more. This, I would note, seems to be the submission put on behalf of Sladojevic in relation to the alleged Fifth Misrepresentation. In reaching the above conclusions I have accepted the essence of Benson's evidence. I have rejected much of Chehade's evidence. I do not accept either Bell's or Sladojevic's evidence concerning when and how they respectively became aware of Chehade's investment or decision to invest. In particular I am satisfied that by 17 July 2000 Bell was aware that Chehade had made a commitment to Benson to invest $500,000.

315 To foreshadow matters, my conclusions here have quite some bearing on my findings in relation to the alleged misrepresentations.

316 Bell's evidence is that he started to talk with Chehade about Chehade buying into the accountancy practice in late July 2000. He said that Sladojevic was by then suggesting to him that he should become a director of Tiltform Licensing. He met with Chehade on 26 July 2000 and then, it seems, offered to sell 90 per cent of the practice to Chehade and/or Tripodi for $200,000. I again note that Tripodi did not start work until 31 July although Bell in oral evidence suggested he must have started earlier. I would also note that there is no evidence that Tripodi was a qualified accountant. There is evidence that he was not.</text>

<tocase>Waterman v Gerling Australia Insurance Co Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1066 ; (2005) 194 FLR 419</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/1066.html</AustLII>
<text>392 I have already referred to cll 2.1 and 2.5 of the Policy which link the provision of the cover to full payment of the policy, cl 2.5 providing that if full payment of the gross premium is not made, "there is no cover". By way of contrast, cl 11.1(a)(v) of the Policy acknowledges the insurer's right to cancel the policy under s 60 of the Insurance Contracts Act where (inter alia) the insured "failed to pay the premium for this policy". This distinction between what I will call "cessation of cover" on the one hand and cancellation of the policy on the other is recognised explicitly in the Act in the manner in which it regulates instalment contracts of general insurance: see s 39 and s 62; and see generally Waterman v Gerling Australia Insurance Co Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1066 ; (2005) 194 FLR 419; Sutton, Insurance Law in Australia , 7.42 (3 rd ed 1999).

393 It is a question of construction of the policy, admittedly under the shadow of the Insurance Contracts Act , as to whether in the circumstances Mr Bell had the cover provided by the CGU at the time of notification of the claims, i.e. 27/28 June 2001. Apart from recognising the difference between cessation of cover and cancellation, the Act does not apply to or regulate directly provisions such as cl 2.5. On its face that sub-clause is a self-executing one. Once the contingency on which it is premised occurs, the cover ceases. The cover may later be revived by the making of payment in full, assuming an election to cancel for non-payment had not by then been made. Unless and until that occurred, there would be no cover notwithstanding that the Policy itself may remain on foot. Far from throwing any doubt on this construction the policy itself supports it.</text>

<text>394 I have not considered it necessary to give detailed consideration to the principles applied in the construction of contracts of insurance. These have recently been essayed by Brereton J in Waterman's case. For my own part, I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusion in that case. It deals with the very issue raised here though with a clause not quite as unmistakeably explicit as here. I would merely wish to emphasise that while I well understand that an automatic cessation of cover might have the same undesirable policy effects as the Australian Law Reform Commission identified in relation to automatic cancellation: see ALRC Report 20 Insurance Contracts , 1982 [246]-[247], I agree with Brereton J that there is nothing in the Insurance Contracts Act , that Report and the now accepted principles of interpretation of contracts: see e.g. Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd (2005) 223 ALR 560 at [71] ff; affd [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1; that would permit the torturing of the clear and coherent terms and text of a contract so as to effectuate that policy in some way. That is a matter for the legislature to address.

395 Accordingly, I am satisfied that there was no insurance cover on 27/28 June 2001; that CGU's defence has been made out; and that the cross-claims must be dismissed with costs.

396 I do not intend to consider the other defences raised by CGU, given that the only live issue between CGU and Bell is costs (having regard to my findings in the Rawley and Chehade matters). However, I should indicate this much. Those defences called into question (i) whether Bell's actions giving rise to the claims against him arose from the conduct of the business planning consultancy covered by the Policy, it being contended that he was acting in the management of Tiltform Licensing by June and July 2000; (ii) whether he was relevantly acting as an "officer of Tiltform Australia and so subject to an express exclusion of the Policy"; (iii) whether Bell's conduct fell within the "unintentional dishonest" acts or omissions exception to the Policy; (iv) whether the policy was voidable under s 28 of the Insurance Contracts Act on account of fraudulent representations contained in the proposal for insurance, or else CGU would have been entitled to reduce its liability to nil. I am of the view in respect of each of these that CGU had a reasonably arguable defence on the material before me.</text>
