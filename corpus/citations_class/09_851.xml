<text>In support of the Application the Applicant has filed an Affidavit which annexes a Draft Notice of Appeal . But that Affidavit fails to comply with r 4(2). It is in inadmissible form but, more relevantly, it is more in the nature of a submission and challenges the factual conclusions made by the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa. But such deficiencies may presently be left to one side. Non-compliance with r 4(2) should not, as in other proceedings where an applicant has been unrepresented (e.g. Lawrance v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1524 at [26] ; Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593 at [6] ), of itself necessarily impede a proper consideration of such merits as an application may present.</text>

<tocase>Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/655.html</AustLII>
<text>When exercising the discretion conferred by s 24(1A) of the 1976 Act to grant leave to appeal, it may be accepted that that provision confers on the court " an unfettered discretion " in " unqualified terms ": Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 per Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ. Considerations relevant when deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted are: whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision were wrong. 
In the present proceeding it is not considered that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attendant with sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted. Nor is it considered that the Applicant would suffer substantial injustice. His application for a protection visa has been considered on its merits by both a delegate of the Minister and by the Tribunal. His application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court has been carefully considered and no legal error discerned. No injustice is exposed in such circumstances.

The Federal Magistrate, in his reasons for decision, recounted the facts relevant to the Applicant's claim for a protection visa. Those reasons record that " [n]o supporting evidence " for the claims being advanced by the Applicant was provided to the Department and also record the rejection of the claim. Those reasons further record that the Applicant was subsequently invited to attend a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal but that he declined that invitation. Express reference is made by the Federal Magistrate to some of the findings made by that Tribunal. Albeit not set forth expressly in his reason for decision, it is relevant to note that the Tribunal further stated: 
 [36] The applicant did not attend the Tribunal hearing. The applicant only made the briefest of claims. The applicant claims he belongs to a minority group in Pakistan, the 'Mohanjir' community who are Muslims by religion. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to accept that he belongs to the 'Mohanjir' community. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that he and his family have been persecuted by the majority community in Pakistan for several years. ... 

 
 [37] I am required to consider the situation if the applicant, a Pakistani citizen from Sialkot, were to return to Pakistan now or within a reasonably foreseeable future. ... But the independent evidence before me ... does not suggest that the applicant would not receive the protection of the Pakistani authorities or that such protection would be ineffective, if the applicant were to be harmed. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that if he returns to Pakistan he will be killed, harmed or persecuted for a Convention related reason. The mere fact that a person claims fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish either the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is "well-founded" or that it is for the reason claimed. 

 
 [38] I do not accept there is a real chance the applicant will suffer harm now or in the foreseeable future if he were to return to Pakistan and I am not satisfied the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention related reason. 

 
Given the paucity of the material submitted in support of his claim and the paucity of the material apparently available to the Tribunal, and the decision of the now Applicant not to accept the invitation extended to him to attend a hearing before the Tribunal, these conclusions were perhaps not unexpected.

The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate then outline the manner in which he approached his task. The Federal Magistrate observed that " the applicant's original application made unparticularised contentions of ' gross violations of the Regulations and the Act '...". An amended application was apparently filed from which the Federal Magistrate discerned " four essential points ".</text>

<text>No explanation is provided in the Applicant's Affidavit as to why any application for leave to appeal was not filed within the time prescribed. In such circumstances a proceeding may be dismissed: e.g. MZXME v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 767.

Before any order is made pursuant to r 5(3) there must be a rational basis upon which any such order may be made.</text>

<text>Notwithstanding the difference in language as between O 52 r 5(3) and O 52 r 15(2), namely the constraint in r 15(2) that the Court may give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal " at any time " where there are " special reasons ", principles relevant to the exercise of that discretion have been applied when considering r 5(3): SZMFT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1725. Cowdroy J there stated: 
 [21] The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay, that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave, and that there is merit in the substantial application: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348 349. There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. 

 
Compliance with O 52 r 5(2) was there dispensed with in circumstances where the application for leave to appeal was filed out of time by ten days. See also: Nguyen v Pascoe [2006] FCA 719 at [41] .</text>

<text>Expressed in perhaps slightly different language, in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 555 , Spender J set forth the terms of O 52 r 5(3) and expressed " the relevant test " as follows: 
 THE RELEVANT TEST
 ... 

 
 [38] The discretion to extend time conferred by that rule is given for the sole purpose of enabling justice to be done between the parties. 

 
 [39] In Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 , McHugh J was concerned with the application of O 60 r 6 of the High Court Rules in respect of the applicant's application for an extension of time. McHugh J said, at 480: 

 
[Order 60 rule 6] provides that a court or a justice may enlarge the time appointed by the Rules for doing an act upon such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require and that the enlargement may be ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act. The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic. The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the court or justice to do justice between the parties: see Hughes v National Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co of Australasia Ltd [1978] VR 257 at 262. This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant.
 
 
 [40] There are two relevant matters concerning whether the Court should exercise its discretion to extend time. The first is whether a sufficient explanation for the delay has been forthcoming; the second is whether the proposed appeal would enjoy any prospect of success, such that it ought be allowed to proceed. 

 
In SZMTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 162 at [5] Buchanan J referred to the language of " special reasons " in O 52 r 15 when considering an application for an extension of time in relation to an " ordinary appeal " and observed that " no lesser test should be employed when considering an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal ". Concurrence is expressed with the observations of both Spender J and Buchanan J.</text>

<text>In the present proceeding, however, neither the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate nor the proposed Notice of Appeal expose any basis upon which an appeal would have any prospects of success. Even if an order were to be made pursuant to O 52 r 5(3), leave to appeal would in any event be refused: see SZDGN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1543. Such a conclusion may be relied upon as a reason for an adverse exercise of the discretion conferred by O 52 r 5(3). Justice in such circumstances does not require a dispensation from compliance with O 52 r 5(2).</text>

<tocase>SZNFR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/408.html</AustLII>
<text>Presently before the Court is an Application for Leave to Appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: SZNFR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 408. That Application seeks both leave to appeal and " an order that compliance with Order 52, subrule 5(2) be dispensed with ".

Leave to appeal is required because the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application before that Court pursuant to Rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). Rule 44.12 provides as follow: 
 Show cause hearing 
 (1) At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may: 

(a) if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed &#8212; dismiss the application; or 
 
(b) if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed &#8212; adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or 
 
(c) without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application. 
 
 (2) To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1) (a) is interlocutory. 

The dismissal of an application pursuant to Rule 44.12(1)(a) is, accordingly, an interlocutory decision and s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the 1976 Act) imposes the requirement to obtain leave before any appeal may be entertained.

In addition, and as the Application itself recognises, the Application as filed in this Court was filed outside the time prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). Rule 5 provides as follows: 
 Time for filing application 
 (1) This rule applies only to applications where an appeal from the judgment lies to the Court only with leave. 
 (2) An application shall be filed within 21 days after: 

(a) the judgment was pronounced; or 
 
(b) a later date fixed for that purpose by the court or judge who pronounced the decision. 
 
 (3) Where an application is not filed within the time limited by subrule (2), an order shall be sought in the application that compliance with subrule (2) be dispensed with.</text>
