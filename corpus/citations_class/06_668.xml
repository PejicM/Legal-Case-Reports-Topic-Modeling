<tocase>Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146</tocase>

<text>12 I also reject the attack on the validity of the assignment. It was put that Mr Whiting although a director of Cellite Sales did not have authority to execute the assignment on its behalf. There are several reasons why I will not accept this contention. For one thing, the articles of association (or constitution) of the company would tell me what authority each director has, but the articles were not tendered. Therefore, I do not know on what basis I should assume that a director cannot bind the company in a transaction of the kind under consideration. Secondly, even if there be any lack of express authority, I would apply the indoor management rule for there is no reason to think that Mr Scrinis, who dealt with Mr Whiting as the person who had carriage of the sale transaction, had any reason to doubt the latter's authority to bind the company: Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146.

13 At the time Carrera Lighting sold its lighting business to the applicant, the respondent was no longer manufacturing the Cellite; it had not manufactured the light for some years. However, and perhaps prompted by the sale, it decided to resume manufacture. Phil Carney, a director of the respondent, got in touch with Mr Shead and asked him whether there was any reason why the respondent could not make and sell the Cellite. According to Mr Shead, he told Mr Carney: "You can't sell the product as a Cellite and you can't use the same diffuser that's being used on the Cellite fitting." Mr Carney was not called to give his account of this discussion.

14 At all events, shortly after the conversation the respondent manufactured and sold to Pulvin Lighting Wholesalers approximately 415 Centurions. The sale was part of a tender for work at the Kempsey Gaol. The applicant had itself tendered for the supply of lights for the Kempsey Gaol, but lost the tender to the respondent, a fact which it only discovered some time later.</text>

<tocase>Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corp Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403</tocase>
<text>16 As to the first question, s 17(1) of the 1906 Act provides a design may be registered if "it is a new or original design". When deciding whether a design is new or original the issue is one of fact, to be determined through the eye of the judge. For that purpose the judge may be instructed by expert evidence. In Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corp Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 Lockhart J (with whom Jenkinson and Gummow JJ agreed) said (at 408-409):
 
 "[I]t is for the court to determine the meaning of a design in proceedings under the Act, whether the central question be the meaning of the design, novelty or infringement... [W]hile some designs are simple so that the court needs no expert evidence to interpret them, other designs are complex and judges require technical assistance in order to understand them. Such evidence is plainly admissible, but ultimately it is for the court to rule on the meaning of a design." 

He went on (at 409) to make a similar observation in relation to the prior art:
 
 "[P]rior art may be a fairly simple matter in a particular case, requiring little or no technical evidence. On the other hand, the understanding and interpretation of prior art may call for expert assistance to be provided to the court... I see no objection in an appropriate case to evidence being received from persons in the relevant trade or industry or members of the public directed to the question of infringement..."

17 Here the prior art consists of several lighting catalogues and brochures as well as several batten lights. These were examined by Peter Bayly, who has extensive experience, spanning almost 50 years, in industrial design. In the end, of course, it is my own impression that will determine whether the registered design is new or original. But I have been assisted by Mr Bayly's evidence in performing my task.

18 The evidence indicates that there was a prolific product range of batten lights around 1989. Of the many products then in existence the product most visually similar to the registered design is the "AVS Series" vandal resistant luminare (the AVS Light) sold by Macwil Lighting &amp; Electrical Co Pty Ltd. During the course of the hearing, it became apparent that if the registered design is new or original when compared with the AVS Light, its newness or originality will not be brought down by the other products I have seen.

27 It is also important to bear in mind what was said by Lockhart J in Dart Industries at 409: 
 
 "Where novelty or originality is discovered in slight variations [from the prior art base], there cannot be infringement without a very close resemblance between the registered design and the article alleged to be an infringement of the design... Small differences between the registered design and the prior art will generally lead to a finding of no infringement if there are equally small differences between the registered design and the alleged infringing article."

28 I make the following observations as regards the Centurion: the luminare is a longitudinal light fitting that houses fluorescent tubes; it is of continuous cross-section and appears to have a greater overall length than the registered design being approximately 11 times its width and having a height approximately two-thirds its width; the shape of the end cap is (as Mr Bayly described it) "basically rectangular, also trapezoidal" and they have no step; the finish of the end caps is not smooth like the finish on the registered design; it has a single centrally aligned screw with a recessed head in the top surface of each end cap; and the diffuser is prismatic rather than the longitudinal lines of the registered design.

29 On the question whether the Centurion is an obvious imitation of the registered design, there is at least one important difference; the registered design has a step in the end caps, the Centurion does not. I consider the presence of the step in the end caps to be a significant feature of the form and shape of the registered design which, together with other configuration features, distinguishes it from the prior art. The absence of the step in the Centurion may be described as a small difference from the registered design but in my opinion it is a sufficient difference to defeat the allegation that the Centurion is an obvious imitation of the registered design.</text>

<tocase>D Sebel &amp; Co Ltd v National Art Metal Co Pty Ltd (1965) 10 FLR 224</tocase>
<text>20 Section 17(1)(a) provides that a design shall not be registered in respect of an article if the design "differs only in immaterial details or in features commonly used in the relevant trade from a design that, before the priority date in respect of the application for registration, was registered ...". Where, as is this case, the prior art is prolific it will often be that small differences will be regarded as "substantial", rather than "immaterial" differences. See generally Ricketson &amp; Creswell, The Law of Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs &amp; Confidential Information , vol 2 [21.80]. Put another way, it is important not to allow the existence of prolific prior art to rob a design of its value. As Jacobs J said in D Sebel &amp; Co Ltd v National Art Metal Co Pty Ltd (1965) 10 FLR 224 at 227, the differences in designs can be "a subtle thing".

21 In a case such as this it is important to keep in mind that a design will not be new or original where the difference between the design and the prior art results from the introduction of common trade variants into an old design. For example, changing the width of the base depending upon the number of fluorescent tubes to be accommodated is a common trade variant. So also is a change in length to accommodate a longer (and therefore stronger wattage) fluorescent tube.

22 There are some similarities in the configuration of the AVS Light and the registered design, namely, both are of continuous rectangular cross-section with a base and diffuser portion extending the whole length of the luminare, and both have two end caps with at least one screw in their top surface that cover the ends of the base and the diffuser. However, the AVS Light and the registered design have a number of differences in their configurations. They also vary in their form and overall shape. The principal areas of difference in configuration between the AVS Light and the registered design are the differing heights of the continuous cross-sections; the base of the AVS Light is approximately half the overall height whereas the base of the registered design is approximately a third the overall height; the height of the diffuser of the AVS Light is approximately half the overall height whereas the height of the diffuser of the registered design is approximately two-thirds the overall height; the length of the AVS Light end caps are approximately two-thirds the overall height while the registered design has end caps approximately equal in length to the overall height. The AVS Light and the registered design also differ in form and shape: the front face of the end caps of the AVS Light are flat whereas each end cap of the registered design has a raised lower portion or step on its front face; the radius on the top edges of the end caps of the AVS Light are approximately one-fifth of its width, compared to radius on the top edges of the end caps of the registered design which are approximately one-tenth of the width of the registered design.</text>

<tocase>Walker &amp; Co v AG Scott (1892) 9 RPC 482</tocase>
<text>23 These differences in configuration, form and shape are "sufficient to impart the character of novelty and originality to the whole" ( Walker &amp; Co v AG Scott (1892) 9 RPC 482 at 485) to distinguish the registered design from the AVS Light.

24 I used the same approach I detailed above to compare the configuration (that is the length versus width and height versus width of the overall light and individual components such as the end caps) and form and shape (focussing on the radius of the edges of the end caps, the positioning of the screws and the presence or absence of a step) of the registered design with the other prior art including in particular the Gayline, the Loira Weather Proof fluorescent, the Minilux and the Regency Series light. The differences in configuration, form and shape between the registered design and these luminaries are more pronounced than the differences I observed between the registered design and the AVS Light. The differences leave me with the impression that the registered design is sufficiently new or original to distinguish it from that prior art referred to.

25 This brings me to the case on infringement. Here, by reason of s 30 of the 1906 Act, there are two issues to be determined. First, is the Centurion an obvious imitation of the registered design (does it appear to be a copy although there are some differences) and, second, is it a fraudulent imitation (with differences made to disguise copying)?</text>

<tocase>Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435</tocase>
<text>26 On this aspect I propose to apply what was said by Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435 at 440. There he summarised the principles to be applied when deciding whether a particular product was an infringement of a registered design:
 
 "(i) first impressions are important in determining whether there is an infringement of a design, 
 (ii) an obvious imitation is one which is not the same as the registered design but is a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences, 
 (iii) the question must be looked at as one of substance and by examining the essential features of the design, 
 (iv) a closer correspondence between the registered design and the alleged infringing design is necessary to satisfy the test of obvious imitation than that of fraudulent imitation, 
 (v) precise mathematical comparisons or matters of measurements or ratios, which form no part of the mental picture which the eye conveys to the brain of shape or configuration suggested by the design, are not to be applied as the test of infringement; appearance to the eye is the critical issue, and 
 (vi) questions of infringement must not be determined by a narrow or overly technical approach in comparison between the design and the alleged infringement, lest the registration be sapped of its worth to the registered owner."</text>

<text>34 The method by which the applicant's damages are to be calculated has been explained by the High Court in Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 643:
 
 "If the law is to take account of future or hypothetical events in assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring... But unless the chance is so low as to be regarded as speculative say less than 1 per cent or so high as to be practically certain say over 99 per cent the court will take that chance into account in assessing the damages. Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of occurring; but to ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of occurring. Thus, the court assesses the degree of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability."
