<tocase>Das v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229</tocase>
<text>5 Finally, what constituted or might constitute serious harm amounting to persecution within the meaning of the Convention was a matter of fact and degree for the Tribunal: see Das v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229 at 237-238 per Sundberg J.

6 The applicant has not sought to articulate any other basis upon which it might be considered or suggested that the Tribunal's decision is affected by jurisdictional error.

7 On 21 November 2006 I found that the applicant's medical certificate did not provide an adequate explanation for his non-attendance at the hearing on that day. I observed that the certificate did not address the question of why the condition referred to would prevent the applicant from travelling to Court and effectively participating in a hearing. Accepting that implicit in the delivery of the certificate was an application for an adjournment, I considered that the mere giving to the Court of a certificate without further explanation was not a proper basis for an adjournment.</text>

<text>2 On this application I need to consider two matters: (a) whether the applicant has an arguable case; and (b) whether the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for non-attendance. I refer generally to the discussion in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 per Jacobson J. The background to this application and the applicant's grounds of appeal filed on 18 August 2006 are set out in my reasons for judgment previously delivered on 21 November 2006: see MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624.</text>

<text>4 The Tribunal also reached its conclusion about the absence of protection obligations on the basis of an independent reason. The Tribunal considered and dealt with a factual substratum of the applicant's claims. The Tribunal was not satisfied that even if the claimed circumstances existed in Pakistan they would give rise to serious harm amounting to persecution. I cannot find any basis for the conclusion that the Tribunal misconstrued or misapplied section 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Nothing in the Tribunal's reasons suggest that it treated the examples in s 91R(2) as an exhaustive statement of what constituted or might constitute serious harm: see VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [60] to [66] per Merkel J. The Tribunal was entitled to consider those examples set out in subsection 91R(2) for guidance: see SBBA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 90 at [13] .</text>

<text>3 In my view the Federal Magistrates Court decision discloses no error. There is nothing to indicate that the Tribunal's finding were not open to it on the evidence. It cannot be said the Tribunal failed to take into account any relevant consideration or took into account an irrelevant consideration or asked itself the wrong question. The Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant's claims demonstrated any Convention nexus. This was a finding of fact, which on the evidence before it was open to be made by the Tribunal: see SZFYC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1810 at [22] .</text>
