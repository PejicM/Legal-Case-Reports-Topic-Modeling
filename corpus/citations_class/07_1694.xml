<text>5 In support of this submission, Dynamic Supplies referred to the recent decision in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146. In that case, the Full Court at [104] accepted the proposition that injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether their conduct falls within the scope of the injunction. This is because failure to comply with the terms of a court order may give rise to contempt proceedings in which determination of questions of construction of the terms of the injunction is not appropriate since ambiguity or uncertainty may be a defence in such proceedings: see ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 259 (per Lockhart J); MacLean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 593 at 599 (per Toohey J). Similar remarks were made by a Full Court of this Court in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563 at 574-575, where the Court adopted the principle that injunctive relief should be based upon the specific case alleged and proved against the defendant, and indicate in clear terms the conduct enjoined so that he or she knows what is expected to be done.</text>

In that case, the Full Court at [104] accepted the proposition that injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether their conduct falls within the scope of the injunction.

12 As noted by Lockhart J in ICI Australia 38 FCR at 259, it is imperative that restraining orders are precisely formulated because contempt proceedings with serious consequences can flow from a failure to comply with such orders. In the light of this, and having regard to my earlier reasons in this matter, I consider that the words " under or by reference to " proposed by Brother are too extensive in their reach because they are capable of including conduct beyond that in respect of which specific findings have been made.

13 I therefore consider that the orders proposed by Brother are appropriate, with the exception of proposed order 3, for which Dynamic Supplies' proposed order 3 should be substituted.

14 In relation to the question of costs of this application relating to the form of orders, I note there have clearly been constructive discussions between the parties in relation to the form of the proposed orders. I therefore consider there should be no order as to costs.</text>
