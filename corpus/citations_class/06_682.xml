<text>72 The statutory phrase that must be construed and applied in this case plays a crucial role in various parts of the TPA and, in all likelihood, the legislature intended that it should carry a consistent meaning wherever it is used in the TPA: see Theo Holdings Pty Ltd v Hockey [2000] FCA 665 ; (2000) 99 FCR 232 at 241 [21] .

74 The policy and purposes underpinning the TPA were examined by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 503-504:
 'As is the case with Pt IV of the [TPA], the evident purpose and policy underlying Pt V , which includes s 52 , recommends a broad construction of its constituent provisions, the legislation being of a remedial character so that it should be construed so as to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow: see the discussion of the authorities by Mason CJ in Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; (1991) 172 CLR 32 at 44. The precise boundaries of the territory within which s 52 operates remain undetermined: Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 601.' 
 

In Webb Distributors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Victoria [1993] HCA 61 ; (1993) 179 CLR 15 at 41, McHugh J said:
 
 'The Trade Practices Act is a fundamental piece of remedial and protectionist legislation. Such legislation should be construed broadly so as "to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow".'

<text>73 In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Association [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69] - [70] , McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said:
 'The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision must be determined "by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole". In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos , Dixon CJ pointed out that "the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed". Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed. 
 
 A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals.'</text>

<tocase>Zaravinos v Diary Farmers Co-Operative Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 195</tocase>
<text>75 In Zaravinos v Diary Farmers Co-Operative Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 195 at 198, Lockhart J explained the particular statutory purposes of Div 2A somewhat more narrowly:
 'The rationale behind Div 2A is that liability for defects in goods should be borne by the manufacturer rather than the retailer because of modern methods of packaging, labelling, distribution and promotion of goods. Division 2A does not apply where there is a contract between the manufacturer and the consumer. It applies where the manufacturer supplies goods to another person, usually a distributor or retailer, who acquires the goods for the purposes of resupply. The Division applies to the supply of goods which are of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption that is, consumer goods.'

76 Notwithstanding the more particular statutory purposes which underpin Div 2A, I consider that a uniform approach should be adopted when construing the definitional phrase found in s 74A(2)(a) and in other provisions of the TPA. Moreover, in my opinion, the statutory phrase should be construed broadly, wherever it appears in the TPA, so as to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow.

77 In general terms, the authorities provide relatively clear guidance as to the way in which the phrase 'goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption' should be construed and applied. Many of the relevant authorities, however, concern the meaning and application of similar but not identical expressions found in sales tax legislation or tariff classification legislation, and care must be exercised in translating what was said in those contexts to the present context.</text>

<tocase>Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450</tocase>
<text>78 The decisions in Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 (' Diethelm '), Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557 (' Chubb '), Clean Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 80 ; (2001) 105 FCR 248 ( 'Clean Investments ') and Hygienic Lily Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396 (' Hygienic Lily ') all involved the construction and application of an expression found in Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), namely 'goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes ...'. I will not attempt to discuss every relevant aspect of these cases because they were reviewed at length by Lindgren J in Clean Investments at 260-274 [35]-[103].

82 Secondly, it is preferable to pose the statutory question (ie the question whether the goods in issue in the particular case are goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption) as a single composite question: see Clean Investments at 273 [91]-[93] per Lindgren J; Diethelm at 472 per Hill J; and Chubb at 559[F] per Burchett J. This can be contrasted with a two-stage inquiry as to, first, the genus of goods in question, and secondly, whether that kind of goods is ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption. As Lindgren J pointed out in Clean Investments , posing the genus question separately as a threshold one runs the risk of prejudging the answer to the statutory question. His Honour said at 273 [92] [93]:
 'In some cases it may be misleading to address separately the question of identification of the "genus" to which the particular goods in question belong, and the question whether that genus meets the description "ordinarily used for household purposes". The problem can be indicated by the question "What kind of goods is the Item speaking of?" Answering the genus question separately as a threshold one will assume, without making explicit, an answer to this question. 
 
 Goods and purposes can be equally correctly described in different ways, in particular, broadly or narrowly, yet the description selected may dictate the answer to the statutory question. For example, an architect's stool, an office chair and a kitchen stool or chair may be described as "stools" or "chairs" and their purpose as being "to provide seating". Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the architect's stool or the office chair is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes for no other reason than that, like the kitchen chair, it is ordinarily used for the purpose of providing seating.' 
 

French J drew attention to the same risk in Diethelm at 465:
 
 'It cannot be enough to say that because some goods fall into a genus wide enough to encompass goods ordinarily used for household purposes, they are therefore "goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes". The mere fact that office chairs and domestic chairs both provide "seating", which in some applications is a household purpose, is not sufficient to establish that office chairs are of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes.' 
 
 
 
 

To my mind, the risk to which their Honours draw attention is a real one. I agree that it is preferable to pose the statutory question as a single composite question. On my reading, that was the course adopted by French J in Diethelm and, I think, by both Hill J and Tamberlin J in Chubb.

83 Thirdly, depending on the precise statutory question and the circumstances of the particular case, it will be relevant to inquire as to the essential character of the goods in question. In Diethelm , French J thought that the answer to the statutory inquiry depended critically on the essential character of the goods. Adopting what had been said by Gummow J in Hygienic Lily at 399, Hill J said that the question whether goods are of a particular kind was to be determined objectively, by reference to the nature, quality and adaptation of the goods in the class or genus in question. However, Hill J also expressed reservations about the essential character test, saying that the inquiry may be useful in some cases but in other cases it may suffer from a lack of precision: at 470. In Chubb , Burchett J doubted the usefulness of the essential character test: at 559. Hill J in Chubb looked beyond the essential character of the goods and took into account evidence that explained the attributes, the intended use and the cost of the goods; Tamberlin J adopted much the same approach as Hill J. In Clean Investments , Lindgren J said that the essential character test lacked sufficient precision to assist in answering the question whether the coin-operated washing machines under consideration in that case constituted goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes: at 273 [96]. Lindgren J added that there is a danger that the essential character test may serve simply to give an undeserved legitimacy to first impressions.

87 Fourthly, the question posed by s 74A(2)(a) is ultimately a question of fact and degree. In Chubb at 559, Burchett J described the question which arose under Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth) in the following way:
 'That is a question of fact into which degree and impression must enter largely, but I do not think its resolution is assisted much by turning back to the essential character of the article. Rather, attention must be focused on the statutory question whether goods of that kind are ordinarily used for household purposes.' 


In the same case, Hill J said at 572 that the trial judge's finding that certain safes were of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes involved:

 
 '... a question of judgment based upon a consideration of the description and in some cases photos or drawings of the relevant safe. No error is apparent in her Honour's judgment, although it is possible that minds could differ as to the outcome in a particular case.' 
 
 
 
 

These assessments are borne out by the actual decisions in Diethelm and Chubb . Both cases ultimately turned on the sufficiency of the evidence to discharge the burden of proof which rested on the applicant for sales tax exemption.

94 In Diethelm , both French J and Hill J emphasised that their approach to the construction and application of the sales tax exemption was heavily influenced by its statutory context.

95 The issue in Diethelm was whether a manufacturer of office furniture was entitled to a special concessionary rate of sales tax on its office chairs on the ground that they fell within the category of 'goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes, namely furniture'. The trial judge found that, while all of the relevant chairs could be bought for use in a home, a high proportion were high quality chairs that were designed and bought for office use. French J dismissed the appeal, holding that the essential character of the chairs in issue was correctly identified as office furniture, reflecting the market in which the chairs were manufactured and sold having regard, inter alia, to their quality, cost, design and intended and actual purchasers: at 465. His Honour thought that the appropriateness of this characterisation was not altered by the fact that the chairs were sometimes used for household purposes, and obviously performed physical functions similar to such chairs, as they were not of a kind ordinarily so used. Hill J was less rigid about the characterisation of the chairs. In the case of some of the chairs, Hill J felt that the characterisation in question should be answered negatively to the manufacturer. For instance, he considered that the high back executive office chair is not a chair of the kind ordinarily used for household purposes; rather it is of a kind ordinarily used for office purposes. The proper characterisation of other chairs was more debatable. In the result, Hill J held that the manufacturer, who had the burden of proof, had not established on the evidence that any particular chair was of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes. In his Honour's view, the evidence did not permit a conclusion on the balance of probabilities that any of the types of chairs sold by the manufacturer was of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes: at 473. Consequently, Hill J dismissed the appeal. Whitlam J agreed with the judgment of Hill J.

97 French J said that, in contrast, the expression 'goods for use' introduces more subjective considerations into the characterisation process. In Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 59 FLR 415, the Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court noted that the expression 'for use in' is purposive, and makes relevant facts such as the operations which the machines in question were intended to perform, built to order to perform, and did perform: at 426 per Lush J (Kaye and Brooking JJ agreeing). In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Stewart [1984] HCA 11 ; (1984) 154 CLR 385, the High Court was concerned with the expression 'goods for use ... and not for sale, by ... a public benevolent institution'. Gibbs CJ (Dawson J agreeing) said that the words 'for use' indicate the purpose to which the goods are intended to be put, rather than the use for which the goods were designed: at 390. Deane J said at 401 that these words require an objective characterisation of the goods themselves in the light of all the relevant circumstances, including knowledge of the actual use which was subsequently made of the goods. French J in Diethelm summed up these authorities by saying, at 464:
 'Where design purposes are referred to in the classification by such phrases as "for use as", the subjective intention of the manufacturer and purchaser and actual uses to which the goods are put may be taken into account in the process of characterisation.'

99 The differences between French J and Hill J in Diethelm may be questions of emphasis and degree. Nonetheless, in the context of the construction and application of the phrase 'goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes' in sales tax legislation, it seems that French J was prepared to allow a greater role for evidence concerning the commercial realities of the manufacture and sale of the goods in question, that is to say evidence concerning the quality, cost, design and the purpose of intended and actual purchasers of the goods in question, than Hill J would allow.

100 In Diethelm , Hill J observed that Gummow J adopted a similarly restricted approach to the characterisation of the goods in question in Hygienic Lily. However, the decision in Hygienic Lily reflects the very narrow basis on which the case was argued. The case concerned paper cups of different sizes that were manufactured for various customers and which were marked by the manufacturer with the various trade marks or designs employed by the relevant customers in their particular businesses. The applicant mounted its case by reference to evidence concerning cups ordered by one particular customer, McDonalds Restaurants. The sole argument advanced by the Commissioner of Taxation was that, as the cups in question were manufactured solely or substantially for the purpose of use in McDonalds Restaurants, they were not goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes within the meaning of the sales tax exemption: at 399.

104 Counsel for the respondent argued that this statement can be reconciled with the apparently more restrictive view which Hill J explained in Diethelm . Counsel pointed out that in Chubb, Hill J maintained the same two stage analysis that he adopted in Diethelm . The first stage involves the determination of the genus to which the goods belong, which is to be made in a common sense way and which may involve a consideration of evidence in borderline cases. The second stage requires a determination of whether the relevant kind of goods is ordinarily used for household purposes: see 569[G]-570[A]. Counsel submitted that Hill J's statement in Diethelm concerning the limited role of evidence was directed to the first stage of the inquiry, whereas his Honour's reference in Chubb to a broader range of evidence was directed towards the second stage of the inquiry.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557</tocase>
<text>78 The decisions in Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 (' Diethelm '), Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557 (' Chubb '), Clean Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 80 ; (2001) 105 FCR 248 ( 'Clean Investments ') and Hygienic Lily Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396 (' Hygienic Lily ') all involved the construction and application of an expression found in Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), namely 'goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes ...'. I will not attempt to discuss every relevant aspect of these cases because they were reviewed at length by Lindgren J in Clean Investments at 260-274 [35]-[103].

81 First, the word 'ordinarily' means 'commonly' or 'regularly', not 'principally', 'exclusively' or 'predominately': see Clean Investments at 273 [97] per Lindgren J; Chubb at 560 per Burchett J, and at 57 per Hill J; Hygienic Lily at 399-400 per Gummow J. Counsel for the respondent invited me to depart from these authorities, and to hold that the word 'ordinarily' as used in s 74A(2)(a) means 'predominately'. In view of the authorities to which I was referred, I doubt that I am free to adopt such a construction. In any event, I am not persuaded that the word 'ordinarily' in s 74A(2)(a) means 'predominately' rather than 'commonly' or 'regularly'. On the contrary, I consider that the meaning which best accords with the policy and the purposes of the TPA is that of 'commonly' or 'regularly'. I am conscious that the Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Vic) (1987) 82 ATC 5110 said at 5112 that the concept of 'ordinarily used for' equals 'whose primary but not necessarily exclusive purpose and customary use is'. However, I do not agree that the word 'ordinarily' should be given such a connotation in s 74A(2)(a) or elsewhere in the TPA.

82 Secondly, it is preferable to pose the statutory question (ie the question whether the goods in issue in the particular case are goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption) as a single composite question: see Clean Investments at 273 [91]-[93] per Lindgren J; Diethelm at 472 per Hill J; and Chubb at 559[F] per Burchett J. This can be contrasted with a two-stage inquiry as to, first, the genus of goods in question, and secondly, whether that kind of goods is ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption. As Lindgren J pointed out in Clean Investments , posing the genus question separately as a threshold one runs the risk of prejudging the answer to the statutory question. His Honour said at 273 [92] [93]:
 'In some cases it may be misleading to address separately the question of identification of the "genus" to which the particular goods in question belong, and the question whether that genus meets the description "ordinarily used for household purposes". The problem can be indicated by the question "What kind of goods is the Item speaking of?" Answering the genus question separately as a threshold one will assume, without making explicit, an answer to this question. 
 
 Goods and purposes can be equally correctly described in different ways, in particular, broadly or narrowly, yet the description selected may dictate the answer to the statutory question. For example, an architect's stool, an office chair and a kitchen stool or chair may be described as "stools" or "chairs" and their purpose as being "to provide seating". Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the architect's stool or the office chair is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes for no other reason than that, like the kitchen chair, it is ordinarily used for the purpose of providing seating.' 
 

French J drew attention to the same risk in Diethelm at 465:
 
 'It cannot be enough to say that because some goods fall into a genus wide enough to encompass goods ordinarily used for household purposes, they are therefore "goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes". The mere fact that office chairs and domestic chairs both provide "seating", which in some applications is a household purpose, is not sufficient to establish that office chairs are of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes.' 
 
 
 
 

To my mind, the risk to which their Honours draw attention is a real one. I agree that it is preferable to pose the statutory question as a single composite question. On my reading, that was the course adopted by French J in Diethelm and, I think, by both Hill J and Tamberlin J in Chubb.

83 Thirdly, depending on the precise statutory question and the circumstances of the particular case, it will be relevant to inquire as to the essential character of the goods in question. In Diethelm , French J thought that the answer to the statutory inquiry depended critically on the essential character of the goods. Adopting what had been said by Gummow J in Hygienic Lily at 399, Hill J said that the question whether goods are of a particular kind was to be determined objectively, by reference to the nature, quality and adaptation of the goods in the class or genus in question. However, Hill J also expressed reservations about the essential character test, saying that the inquiry may be useful in some cases but in other cases it may suffer from a lack of precision: at 470. In Chubb , Burchett J doubted the usefulness of the essential character test: at 559. Hill J in Chubb looked beyond the essential character of the goods and took into account evidence that explained the attributes, the intended use and the cost of the goods; Tamberlin J adopted much the same approach as Hill J. In Clean Investments , Lindgren J said that the essential character test lacked sufficient precision to assist in answering the question whether the coin-operated washing machines under consideration in that case constituted goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes: at 273 [96]. Lindgren J added that there is a danger that the essential character test may serve simply to give an undeserved legitimacy to first impressions.

87 Fourthly, the question posed by s 74A(2)(a) is ultimately a question of fact and degree. In Chubb at 559, Burchett J described the question which arose under Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth) in the following way:
 'That is a question of fact into which degree and impression must enter largely, but I do not think its resolution is assisted much by turning back to the essential character of the article. Rather, attention must be focused on the statutory question whether goods of that kind are ordinarily used for household purposes.' 


In the same case, Hill J said at 572 that the trial judge's finding that certain safes were of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes involved:

 
 '... a question of judgment based upon a consideration of the description and in some cases photos or drawings of the relevant safe. No error is apparent in her Honour's judgment, although it is possible that minds could differ as to the outcome in a particular case.' 
 
 
 
 

These assessments are borne out by the actual decisions in Diethelm and Chubb . Both cases ultimately turned on the sufficiency of the evidence to discharge the burden of proof which rested on the applicant for sales tax exemption.

103 The Court in Chubb considered whether any and which of the freestanding, wall-mounted or floor-mounted safes manufactured by Chubb fell within the same sales tax exemption. In the course of his judgment, Hill J returned to the question of what evidence is relevant in determining the statutory question. His Honour concluded, at 571:
 'It is clear that, in determining whether a particular safe is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes, it could be relevant to take into account the intended contents of the safe, its security rating, its size or capacity and, related to these matters, its cost. The answer in a particular case may well be one on which minds may differ, for ultimately the determination whether a particular safe or cabinet falls within the Item is a matter of impression. A matter of degree is involved.'

104 Counsel for the respondent argued that this statement can be reconciled with the apparently more restrictive view which Hill J explained in Diethelm . Counsel pointed out that in Chubb, Hill J maintained the same two stage analysis that he adopted in Diethelm . The first stage involves the determination of the genus to which the goods belong, which is to be made in a common sense way and which may involve a consideration of evidence in borderline cases. The second stage requires a determination of whether the relevant kind of goods is ordinarily used for household purposes: see 569[G]-570[A]. Counsel submitted that Hill J's statement in Diethelm concerning the limited role of evidence was directed to the first stage of the inquiry, whereas his Honour's reference in Chubb to a broader range of evidence was directed towards the second stage of the inquiry.

105 I am not persuaded that the two passages can be reconciled in this way. The passage in Chubb is not seeking to distinguish between different steps or stages in the inquiry; rather it is addressing the composite statutory question whether a particular good is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes.

106 In Chubb , Tamberlin J took broad view of the categories of evidence that might be relevant to the determination of the statutory question, at 576: 
 'In making a determination it is clearly permissible to take into account matters such as intended contents, security rating, strength, materials, weight, height, breadth and depth, capacity, price and the value in a monetary sense of the items to be protected. None of these matters is determinative but they are matters against which the classification ought to be made. In particular instances of doubt it will be necessary to give greater weight to one or more of these considerations. 
 
 Because the exemption is concerned with the "kind" of goods it is not appropriate or necessary to limit the evidentiary material to that which relates solely to the particular products of a single manufacturer. It is permissible to consider products of a similar type made by other manufacturers in respect of size, dimensions, cost, capacity and security rating, for example. It will often be helpful to take into account the segment of the safe and security market at which the goods are targeted in advertising and promotional material.' 
 

The determination to which Tamberlin J was referring in this passage was, I think, the determination of the question posed by the statutory language, and not merely the determination of the relevant kind or genus of goods to which the particular goods belong.

107 There is an obvious difference between these sales tax cases and s 74A(2)(a) of the TPA. Section 74A(2)(a) refers to 'goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption' (my emphasis). Even more clearly than the words 'ordinarily used for', this language invites attention to design features and purposes, cost quality and pricing considerations, and the range of uses and applications for the goods which have been targeted in advertising and promotional material. I see no reason why the permissible range of evidence should not extend to what French J called 'the commercial realities of [the] manufacture and sale' of the relevant goods and, as Tamberlin J suggested, similar goods made by other manufacturers. Nor do I see any reason why the use of this evidence is to be confined to the 'genus' question (assuming it is to be addressed separately), rather than being used to assist more broadly in determining the composite statutory question.

108 I therefore accept that a broad range of evidence may be relevant and potentially useful in answering the statutory question. At the same time, I recognise the importance of bearing constantly in mind that the statutory question is whether the goods are of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption. Care must be taken to ensure that the detail of the evidence does not blur this question, or distract the Court from the appropriate inquiry. It would, for example, be a mistake to become so focused on the properties, attributes and intended and advertised uses of the particular goods that the Court fails to address the statutory question. This risk would materialise if the kind of goods were to be identified so narrowly that it amounted to little more than a description of the particular goods.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/80.html</AustLII>
<text>78 The decisions in Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 (' Diethelm '), Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557 (' Chubb '), Clean Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 80 ; (2001) 105 FCR 248 ( 'Clean Investments ') and Hygienic Lily Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396 (' Hygienic Lily ') all involved the construction and application of an expression found in Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), namely 'goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes ...'. I will not attempt to discuss every relevant aspect of these cases because they were reviewed at length by Lindgren J in Clean Investments at 260-274 [35]-[103].

81 First, the word 'ordinarily' means 'commonly' or 'regularly', not 'principally', 'exclusively' or 'predominately': see Clean Investments at 273 [97] per Lindgren J; Chubb at 560 per Burchett J, and at 57 per Hill J; Hygienic Lily at 399-400 per Gummow J. Counsel for the respondent invited me to depart from these authorities, and to hold that the word 'ordinarily' as used in s 74A(2)(a) means 'predominately'. In view of the authorities to which I was referred, I doubt that I am free to adopt such a construction. In any event, I am not persuaded that the word 'ordinarily' in s 74A(2)(a) means 'predominately' rather than 'commonly' or 'regularly'. On the contrary, I consider that the meaning which best accords with the policy and the purposes of the TPA is that of 'commonly' or 'regularly'. I am conscious that the Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Vic) (1987) 82 ATC 5110 said at 5112 that the concept of 'ordinarily used for' equals 'whose primary but not necessarily exclusive purpose and customary use is'. However, I do not agree that the word 'ordinarily' should be given such a connotation in s 74A(2)(a) or elsewhere in the TPA.

82 Secondly, it is preferable to pose the statutory question (ie the question whether the goods in issue in the particular case are goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption) as a single composite question: see Clean Investments at 273 [91]-[93] per Lindgren J; Diethelm at 472 per Hill J; and Chubb at 559[F] per Burchett J. This can be contrasted with a two-stage inquiry as to, first, the genus of goods in question, and secondly, whether that kind of goods is ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption. As Lindgren J pointed out in Clean Investments , posing the genus question separately as a threshold one runs the risk of prejudging the answer to the statutory question. His Honour said at 273 [92] [93]:
 'In some cases it may be misleading to address separately the question of identification of the "genus" to which the particular goods in question belong, and the question whether that genus meets the description "ordinarily used for household purposes". The problem can be indicated by the question "What kind of goods is the Item speaking of?" Answering the genus question separately as a threshold one will assume, without making explicit, an answer to this question. 
 
 Goods and purposes can be equally correctly described in different ways, in particular, broadly or narrowly, yet the description selected may dictate the answer to the statutory question. For example, an architect's stool, an office chair and a kitchen stool or chair may be described as "stools" or "chairs" and their purpose as being "to provide seating". Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the architect's stool or the office chair is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes for no other reason than that, like the kitchen chair, it is ordinarily used for the purpose of providing seating.' 
 

French J drew attention to the same risk in Diethelm at 465:
 
 'It cannot be enough to say that because some goods fall into a genus wide enough to encompass goods ordinarily used for household purposes, they are therefore "goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes". The mere fact that office chairs and domestic chairs both provide "seating", which in some applications is a household purpose, is not sufficient to establish that office chairs are of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes.' 
 
 
 
 

To my mind, the risk to which their Honours draw attention is a real one. I agree that it is preferable to pose the statutory question as a single composite question. On my reading, that was the course adopted by French J in Diethelm and, I think, by both Hill J and Tamberlin J in Chubb.

83 Thirdly, depending on the precise statutory question and the circumstances of the particular case, it will be relevant to inquire as to the essential character of the goods in question. In Diethelm , French J thought that the answer to the statutory inquiry depended critically on the essential character of the goods. Adopting what had been said by Gummow J in Hygienic Lily at 399, Hill J said that the question whether goods are of a particular kind was to be determined objectively, by reference to the nature, quality and adaptation of the goods in the class or genus in question. However, Hill J also expressed reservations about the essential character test, saying that the inquiry may be useful in some cases but in other cases it may suffer from a lack of precision: at 470. In Chubb , Burchett J doubted the usefulness of the essential character test: at 559. Hill J in Chubb looked beyond the essential character of the goods and took into account evidence that explained the attributes, the intended use and the cost of the goods; Tamberlin J adopted much the same approach as Hill J. In Clean Investments , Lindgren J said that the essential character test lacked sufficient precision to assist in answering the question whether the coin-operated washing machines under consideration in that case constituted goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes: at 273 [96]. Lindgren J added that there is a danger that the essential character test may serve simply to give an undeserved legitimacy to first impressions.</text>

<text>78 The decisions in Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 (' Diethelm '), Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557 (' Chubb '), Clean Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 80 ; (2001) 105 FCR 248 ( 'Clean Investments ') and Hygienic Lily Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396 (' Hygienic Lily ') all involved the construction and application of an expression found in Item 1 of the Third Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), namely 'goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes ...'. I will not attempt to discuss every relevant aspect of these cases because they were reviewed at length by Lindgren J in Clean Investments at 260-274 [35]-[103].

81 First, the word 'ordinarily' means 'commonly' or 'regularly', not 'principally', 'exclusively' or 'predominately': see Clean Investments at 273 [97] per Lindgren J; Chubb at 560 per Burchett J, and at 57 per Hill J; Hygienic Lily at 399-400 per Gummow J.

83 Thirdly, depending on the precise statutory question and the circumstances of the particular case, it will be relevant to inquire as to the essential character of the goods in question. In Diethelm , French J thought that the answer to the statutory inquiry depended critically on the essential character of the goods. Adopting what had been said by Gummow J in Hygienic Lily at 399, Hill J said that the question whether goods are of a particular kind was to be determined objectively, by reference to the nature, quality and adaptation of the goods in the class or genus in question.

In Clean Investments , Lindgren J said that the essential character test lacked sufficient precision to assist in answering the question whether the coin-operated washing machines under consideration in that case constituted goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes: at 273 [96]. Lindgren J added that there is a danger that the essential character test may serve simply to give an undeserved legitimacy to first impressions.

96 French J drew attention to the statutory context and the general principles that the classification of goods attracting exemptions or beneficial rates of tax should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrower construction, and that words or phrases should be construed according to their popular meaning unless the evidence establishes that they carry a special commercial or trade meaning in their context: at 457 and 464. His Honour also noted that generalisations about the construction of statutory classifications are to be undertaken with caution, and that subtle changes in language can significantly alter the meaning and operation of a particular provision. French J contrasted the construction given by the authorities to the expression 'ordinarily used for household purposes' with the construction given to the expression 'goods for use' in some specified activity or by some specified person or entity. The former expression has attracted an objective test for characterisation of the goods said to fall within it: see Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Newbound &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1952) 10 ATD 59; 26 ALJR 386 at 387 per Dixon CJ; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 477; O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121 at 4123; and Hygienic Lily at 399. In the light of these authorities, French J expressed the test as follows, at 460:
 'The question whether goods are "ordinarily used for household purposes" does not depend critically upon the use to which they are in fact put but on an assessment of their "essential character". That assessment does not involve fine semantic distinctions but a judgment which pays regard to the commercial realities of their manufacture and sale.'

100 In Diethelm , Hill J observed that Gummow J adopted a similarly restricted approach to the characterisation of the goods in question in Hygienic Lily. However, the decision in Hygienic Lily reflects the very narrow basis on which the case was argued. The case concerned paper cups of different sizes that were manufactured for various customers and which were marked by the manufacturer with the various trade marks or designs employed by the relevant customers in their particular businesses. The applicant mounted its case by reference to evidence concerning cups ordered by one particular customer, McDonalds Restaurants. The sole argument advanced by the Commissioner of Taxation was that, as the cups in question were manufactured solely or substantially for the purpose of use in McDonalds Restaurants, they were not goods of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes within the meaning of the sales tax exemption: at 399.</text>

<text>79 Subject to the caveat just mentioned, the sales tax cases contain the most helpful discussion of the principles that should guide the construction of the statutory phrase in s 74A(2)(a). There are some relevant decisions in the trade practices area dealing directly with the construction of the statutory phrase or substantially similar expressions: see Crago v Multiquip Pty Ltd &amp; Dunogan Farm Tech Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-620 (' Crago' ); Minchillo v Ford Motor Company of Australia [1995] 2 VR 594 (' Minchillo') ; Jillawarra Grazing Co v John Shearer Ltd (1984) ATPR 40-441 (' Jillawarra') ; Carpet Call Pty Ltd v Chan (1987) ASC 55-553 (' Carpet Call' ); and Westminster Properties Pty Ltd v Comco Constructions Pty Ltd (1991) 5 WAR 191 (' Westminster') . However, these cases tend to illustrate the application of the statutory phrase, rather than provide any illuminating discussion of the relevant principles of construction.

88 Beyond endorsing a commonsense approach, the cases that have been decided under s 74A(2)(a) or s 52A(5) of the TPA do not take the analysis much further. In Crago , Lehane J considered whether an ostrich egg incubator and hatcher were goods falling within s 74A(2)(a). Lehane J concluded that they were not. In reaching this conclusion, he said that it was appropriate to ask whether the nature of particular goods is such that they are or are not of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, even in the absence of evidence of actual use: see at 40,798. Lehane J also placed weight on evidence that the goods were used in the ostrich egg 'industry' and that ostriches and their eggs were traded at high prices, and on the lack of evidence that the incubators were in fact acquired for personal, domestic or household use. His Honour drew a distinction between products which might be regarded as of a kind acquired for personal, domestic or household use 'as a matter of common sense' (such as a carpet, a washing machine or a television set) and an ostrich egg incubator.</text>

90 In Minchillo, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision that a prime mover was not 'goods' to which Div 2A of Part V of the TPA applied. Ormiston J, with whose reasons Fullagher and Brooking JJ concurred, stated at 617:
 'The argument must be rejected, for it takes no proper account of the use of the words "ordinarily acquired". Although the words "domestic or household" have a similar connotation, "personal" use is clearly intended to cover a wider field, but the primary contrast intended to be drawn is with commercial or business use, whatever other personal activities a vehicle may be used for. In the case of a prime mover it is hard to see that it would, in the ordinary understanding of those words, be "ordinarily acquired for personal ... use." The causes of action under ss 74B and 74D relied upon by the appellants were therefore rightly dismissed by the trial judge.'</text>

92 In Carpet Call, Thomas J considered that carpet installed in a nightclub was within the scope of the statutory phrase. It was unnecessary for Thomas J to discuss the point at length as he decided the case on other grounds, but his Honour observed at 57,187:
 'In my view "carpet" is a commodity, or goods, ordinarily acquired for domestic consumption, and it does not lose that description by reason of a commercial rating, or some quality which makes it last longer than other carpet normally supplied for use in a domestic setting. In fact the carpet supplied (as to which the warranty is alleged to apply) was of a domestic rating. The point may deserve discussion at greater length, but for the purpose of noting the submissions and expressing a provisional view, it is not necessary to engage in such discussion here.'

93 Two aspects of the sales tax cases merit further discussion because they have influenced my approach to the construction and application of the phrase found in s 74A(2)(a) of the TPA. The first aspect concerns the significance that attaches to the statutory context and small differences in the language of the statutory phrase. The issue is whether the statutory context of s 74A(2)(a), and the slightly different language used in that section, requires an approach to characterisation that differs from that adopted in the sales tax and customs cases. The second and related aspect concerns the proper scope of the evidence that can be taken into account in answering the statutory question posed by s 74A(2)(a).</text>

91 In Westminster , the applicant brought a claim against the respondent pursuant to s 52A of the TPA, which prohibited a corporation from engaging in unconscionable conduct. By force of subs (5), s 52A only applied to goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption. The Full Court held that building services provided by the respondent pursuant to a contract to erect a multi-storey office block were not services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption: at 206-207 per Kennedy J. Kennedy J also said that s 52A is directed essentially at consumer-type transactions, although the wording of the section is not such as to automatically exclude even substantial corporations from the category of consumer in every case: at 207.</text>

<tocase>Air International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2002] FCA 355 ; (2002) 121 FCR 149</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/355.html</AustLII>
<text>84 In Air International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2002] FCA 355 ; (2002) 121 FCR 149, the Full Court considered whether imported fan assemblies, condensers and evaporators were goods 'of a kind used as replacement components in passenger vehicles' within the meaning of a particular item of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Cth). Tamberlin J adopted Gummow J's approach to the classification of a genus of goods in Hygenic Lily and considered whether the components in their nature, adaptation or quality could properly be characterised as 'replacement' components. His Honour had regard to evidence of actual use of the goods in deciding whether the goods are 'of a kind', stating at 160 [53]:
 'It is helpful to look at actual use, if any, when deciding whether goods are of a kind used as replacement components. Where they are so used, then that points to a conclusion that they are "of a kind" so used. The words "of a kind" add a further level of generality to the expression "used" so that even if (to use the Tribunal's expression) the goods are not so used but are within a range of goods of a type which are used, then they satisfy the required description.' 


Tamberlin J considered that it was open to the Tribunal to find, as it did, that the goods were of a genus of goods that were used as replacement components. O'Loughlin J agreed with Tamberlin J. In his dissenting judgment, Hill J said at 158 [35]:

 
 'In my view the proper approach to the question of classification here, where it is obvious that the imported parts are capable of being used either as original parts for the assembly of motor vehicle air conditioning units or to replace parts that had previously been imported and used in the assembly of such motor vehicle air conditioning units is to consider what the essential character of the particular imported goods is. It can be accepted both from the language of the particular subheading and from the fact that customs duty will be payable on entry and before actual use, that the question how the particular parts are in fact used, will, subject to the comments below, be irrelevant to the question. That does not mean, however, that the purpose for which the goods are imported will be irrelevant.' 


On the facts of the case, Hill J found that it was not possible to classify the goods by reference to their essential character and that, accordingly, it was necessary to classify the goods by reference to the exclusive or primary purpose for which they were imported. Hill J explained the reasons why that was so in the following passage, at 158-159 [37]:

 
 '... I am of the view that goods cannot, for customs classification, be treated as belonging to more than one "kind". Further, where no distinction exists between articles which are of the kind used as replacement components, and those which are not, (and the present is such a case) the only way in which the relevant kind can be ascertained will be by ascertaining what the exclusive or primary purpose is for which the goods are imported. Subsequent use, may be the best evidence of that purpose. In my view it will generally be the case with goods of the present kind, that they will take their character from the purpose of the importing, rather than anything which is an inherent quality of the goods themselves.'

85 In contrast, Tamberlin J said that the intent or purpose of the manufacturer or importer is not the criterion to be applied: at 159 [46].

86 In my opinion, in the context of s 74A(2)(a) of the TPA, the essential character test is relevant, but the inquiry does not end there. The statutory question cannot be answered without a broader inquiry into the evidence concerning the design, marketing, pricing and potential uses of the type of goods in question.</text>

The former expression has attracted an objective test for characterisation of the goods said to fall within it: see Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Newbound &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1952) 10 ATD 59; 26 ALJR 386 at 387 per Dixon CJ; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 477; O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121 at 4123; and Hygienic Lily at 399. In the light of these authorities, French J expressed the test as follows, at 460:
 'The question whether goods are "ordinarily used for household purposes" does not depend critically upon the use to which they are in fact put but on an assessment of their "essential character". That assessment does not involve fine semantic distinctions but a judgment which pays regard to the commercial realities of their manufacture and sale.'</text>

<text>96 French J drew attention to the statutory context and the general principles that the classification of goods attracting exemptions or beneficial rates of tax should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrower construction, and that words or phrases should be construed according to their popular meaning unless the evidence establishes that they carry a special commercial or trade meaning in their context: at 457 and 464.

<text>97 French J said that, in contrast, the expression 'goods for use' introduces more subjective considerations into the characterisation process. In Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 59 FLR 415, the Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court noted that the expression 'for use in' is purposive, and makes relevant facts such as the operations which the machines in question were intended to perform, built to order to perform, and did perform: at 426 per Lush J (Kaye and Brooking JJ agreeing). In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Stewart [1984] HCA 11 ; (1984) 154 CLR 385, the High Court was concerned with the expression 'goods for use ... and not for sale, by ... a public benevolent institution'. Gibbs CJ (Dawson J agreeing) said that the words 'for use' indicate the purpose to which the goods are intended to be put, rather than the use for which the goods were designed: at 390. Deane J said at 401 that these words require an objective characterisation of the goods themselves in the light of all the relevant circumstances, including knowledge of the actual use which was subsequently made of the goods. French J in Diethelm summed up these authorities by saying, at 464:
 'Where design purposes are referred to in the classification by such phrases as "for use as", the subjective intention of the manufacturer and purchaser and actual uses to which the goods are put may be taken into account in the process of characterisation.'</text>
