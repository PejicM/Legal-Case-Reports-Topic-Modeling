<tocase>Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 391</tocase>
<text>Such test is objective. There is no requirement that every element of the potential cause of action in fact exists but rather that there may be entitlement to relief: see Hooper Hooper and Others v Kirella Pty Ltd; Transfield Pty Ltd v Airservices Australia [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 at [39] ; Malouf v Malouf [1999] FCA 710 at [16] ; Quanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd (2000) 175 ALR 536 at [24]; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 391 ; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd and Another [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26] ; Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] .

In Alphapharm , Lindgren J at [50] said that it was not adequate that a party 'hopes to be comforted in taking the decision which it already has sufficient information to enable it to take' .

If an exclusivity agreement in writing between Keycorp and Gemalto exists, it may contain details concerning the date or events causing its expiry. Accordingly, the existence of any such agreement would be a significant matter to HID in its determination of whether it should commence the foreshadowed litigation. Further, any correspondence between Keycorp and Gemalto which might indicate that Keycorp treats the exclusivity agreement to be at an end could also be of significance for such purpose. Any written memorandum or record, for example of a telephone conversation, between Keycorp and Gemalto relating to the termination of such exclusivity agreement in the relevant period, namely between 4 August 2008 and 25 August 2008, would serve the same purpose.

The Court does not regard the claim for preliminary discovery as being one designed to strengthen or enhance the decision to commence proceedings. No such decision has yet been made, although HID has grounds for believing that it may be entitled to make a claim under the Trade Practices Act and possibly under promissory estoppel. The documents are sought for the purpose of providing sufficient information to enable a decision whether to make a claim. In this respect, any documents of the kind referred to in subparagraph 1(d) of the Application could be relevant.

The Court is satisfied that HID does not have sufficient information to institute proceedings. The present circumstances are accordingly different to those considered by Lindgren J in Alphafarm .

For the above reasons, the Court grants the application for preliminary discovery, in respect of the documents referred to in paragraphs 1(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the application.
 I certify that the preceding forty-seven (47) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1223.html</AustLII>
<text>The necessity to make enquiries from other sources was considered by Tamberlin J in CGU Insurance Ltd and Others v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad [2001] FCA 1223 ; (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [23] - [27] . At [25] his Honour said: 
 The provision does not contemplate an order where some reasonable inquiries have been made but rather where all reasonable inquiries have been made. It appears to contemplate a reasonable exhaustion of alternative sources of information and, in any particular case, involves a pragmatic balancing of considerations. The power of the Court arises after the applicant has made all reasonable inquiries and finds that there is insufficient information to enable a decision to be made.

There is no evidence of any attempts made by HID to ascertain from Gemalto whether the exclusivity arrangement existed. However, the question is whether it is reasonable to expect that HID would, prior to commencing litigation, inquire of Gemalto whether it held an exclusivity arrangement. That is, whether it was reasonable to expect that it would ask its competitor to provide information which relates solely to a commercial transaction made between Gemalto and Keycorp, in respect of which HID was an unsuccessful bidder.

The Court is not persuaded that it was reasonable for HID, a commercial competitor of Gemalto, to have made such inquiries of Gemalto concerning the existence of any exclusivity arrangement between Gemalto and Keycorp. Therefore, such an inquiry was not necessary to satisfy the first requirement of O 15A r 6(b), namely that HID make 'all reasonable inquiries . '</text>

<text>In Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [14] Tamberlin J referred to the principle that 'O 15A r 6 is to be beneficially construed and given the fullest scope that its language will reasonably allow, with the proper brake on any excesses lying in the discretion of the Court in the light of the specific circumstances' . However at [19] his Honour referred to the necessity for an applicant for preliminary discovery to show 'more than a mere assertion that there is a case against a prospective respondent' . His Honour continued: 
 The purpose of preliminary discovery is not to produce material which will strengthen or enhance a decision to commence proceedings but rather what is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made.</text>
