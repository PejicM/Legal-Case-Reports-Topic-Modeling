 RESPONDENT 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 31 MARCH 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 RULING 
 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

2 Cadbury seeks to rely on an affidavit of Caroline Judy Shelton which exhibits the report of a chocolate sensory study conducted in November last year. Survey evidence has been admitted in this Court at least since Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313.

3 Broadly speaking, the study involved 102 participants who attended at the premises of Ms Shelton's organisation, National Field Services (NFS). The people were shown chocolates of undisclosed origin, in fact made by Cadbury, in different forms, such as block, Easter eggs, chocolate coated almonds etc, with different coloured wrappings. Different questions were asked of the participants in relation to their reactions, for example, did they recognise any particular brand of chocolate manufacturer.

4 It was said in opposition to the tender that it was hearsay. I think insofar as the responses that the participants gave to the persons conducting the study, they fall within section 72 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) as being a representation made by such persons that were a contemporaneous representation about their feelings, sensations, knowledge or state of mind.</text>

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 31 MARCH 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 RULING 
 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

12 Finally, as to whether it would cause or result in undue waste of time, I must say I am troubled by the attitude that Cadbury's solicitors have taken to the Practice Note No. 11. No explanation has been proffered for the non-compliance in relation to this survey. As Tamberlin J said in Eveready Australia Pty Ltd v. Gillette Australia Pty Ltd (1999) FCA 1379 at par [23] : 
 
 "The purpose of the practice note - which was issued as long ago as 8 April 1994 - is to minimise costs and hearing time by obtaining an early determination as to the admissibility and form of survey evidence."

13 However, counsel for Cadbury is, I think, correct in saying there is no evidence before the Court to draw any inference as to the absence of compliance with Practice Note 11. It would be wrong to use the exercise of discretion under s 135 in effect as a punishment for non-compliance with the Practice Note. It is well established that compliance with the Practice Note is not a criterion of admissibility.

14 As to undue waste of time, senior counsel for Darrell Lea criticised the report. For example, he said there was a disproportionate number of female participants and failure to disclose the protocols. If these points are taken up in cross-examination, they may cause some time to be taken up. Perhaps that is a waste which could have been avoided if the Practice Note had been followed, but in all the circumstances I do not think I can say it will be an undue waste of time. So the affidavit of Ms Shelton will be received. 
 
 I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Ruling herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.
