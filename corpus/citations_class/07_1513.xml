<text>2 However, this would not be the first time when solicitors on behalf of clients have made firm assertions of wrongdoing by a proposed defendant. Assertion is not proof. There are equally stern denials made in the responses to those assertions by the respondent's solicitors. As counsel for the applicants put it, an essential element of the claim is that Dr Minas is using the algorithm forming part of the applicants' system. There remains a possibility that he has created a new algorithm, and the applicants, reasonably, in my opinion, wants to obtain forensic examination to eliminate that possibility before making a final decision whether to commence proceedings. I note that the provisions of O 15A r 6(b) extend to a decision whether or not to commence a proceeding which depends on whether or not a defence may be made out: see, Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd at 8 (unreported, Lindgren J, 24 May 1996).

3 Accordingly, the court finds in favour of the applicants' motion.






 I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice HEEREY.
