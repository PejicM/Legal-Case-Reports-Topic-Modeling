<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>24 The Tribunal was placed in a difficult situation by reason of the issue having been expressly adverted to only after the completion of the hearing in the way it was. However, the Tribunal, by implication, professed to be aware of s 7(1) and then went on to expressly consider that issue in the decision. In doing so, it held that there was no evidence in relation to it. That was not correct. To so hold was an error on a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 per Mason CJ at 355 (agreed with by Brennan J and Deane J); Lees v Repatriation Commission [2002] FCAFC 398 ; (2002) 125 FCR 331 at [21] [25]).</text>
