<tocase>Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Anor (1977) 30 FLR 108</tocase>
<text>7 The affidavit evidence discloses that there are intricate factual and legal matters, involving numerous parties, arising in the Supreme Court proceedings. This Court may grant leave under s 58(3) of the Bankruptcy Act if it considers that the issues would be better and more comprehensively dealt with by a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than would be the case if the applicants were required to lodge a proof of debt in respect of the bankrupt estate: see Allanson v Midland Credit Limited and Anor (1977) 30 FLR 108 at 114 per Bowen CJ, Riley and Deane JJ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta and Ors (2005) 216 ALR 670 at [19]-[21] per Conti J.</text>
