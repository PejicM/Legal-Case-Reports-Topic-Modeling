<tocase>Patrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd v The Proceeds of Sale of the Vessel MV Skulptor Konenkov (1997) 75 FCR 47</tocase>
<text>6 In Patrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd v The Proceeds of Sale of the Vessel MV Skulptor Konenkov (1997) 75 FCR 47 at 50 51, Sheppard J said:
 
 Neither the provisions of the Admiralty Act nor those of the Admiralty Rules deal generally with the priority of claims against the proceeds of sale of a vessel arrested and sold by the Court. The English practice should be followed in Australia. There was no submission that I should do otherwise. The order of priorities is stated in Meeson N, Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice (1993). It is there said (at 159-161) that, although there is a well-settled order of priorities which is regularly applied by the Court, this order is only a prima facie ranking. The determination of priorities is an equitable jurisdiction and in theory the Court exercises its discretion afresh in the circumstances of each case. In practice, the court follows the well-settled order of priorities and then considers whether there are any particular circumstances where justice requires it to disturb that prima facie order.
 
 The overall framework of priorities is said to be straightforward. It is as follows:
 
 
 
 (i) The Admiralty marshal's charges and expenses are a first charge on the proceeds of sale and will be paid out in priority to any other claim. The marshal's charges and expenses will include the expenses incurred in effecting the arrest, in maintaining the arrest, for example in paying port dues or for the cost of a shipkeeper and supplies required to maintain the ship whilst under arrest. Also included will be any other expenses authorised by the Court to enable the ship to be sold for the best possible price. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) After the expenses of the marshal have been satisfied, priority is granted to the original arresting party in respect of the costs of his action up to and including the arrest and the costs of the party who obtained the order for appraisement and sale up to and including the date of the making of that order. All these costs were incurred by the original plaintiffs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) A claim with a maritime lien ranks first and has priority over all other types of claim. There are no maritime liens involved in the present case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) Claims by mortgagees; there is no such claim in the present case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) Claims of others entitled to proceed in Admiralty in rem will be subject to maritime liens and mortgages but will have priority over general creditors of the shipowner, except those who have perfected their execution prior to the issue of the writ in rem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vi) The claims of in personam creditors of the owner and of the res will be last, having no priority. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vii) The owner of the res is entitled to the balance remaining, if any.

7 Although the determination of priorities is an exercise of the Court's equitable jurisdiction, theoretically it exercises its discretion afresh in the circumstances of each case. As all the potentially affected parties have had an opportunity to make submissions as to whether the normal priority rules should apply, and some including the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East have accepted that they should apply, and none has submitted that they should not apply, in the exercise of my discretion, I determine that those principles should apply.

8 In accordance with those principles, those who have a judgment against the ship have agreed to the Admiralty Marshal's charges and expenses having been paid as a first charge on the proceeds of sale and in priority to any other claim. The charges and expenses include the Marshal's expenses incurred in effecting the arrest, in maintaining the arrest, and in supplies to maintain the ship whilst under arrest and to secure its sale for the best possible price. There is no dispute as to the amounts paid to the Marshal having properly been treated as a first charge on the proceeds of sale held in the ship account. Hence, the Admiralty Marshal has been paid either directly or in reimbursement to the plaintiff for advances made to the Marshal's account by the plaintiff on account of expenses to be paid by the Marshal the sum of US$547,484.20. There were six separate orders made for payment of, or reimbursement of, the Marshal's expenses. They were, as necessary, converted into US$ at the time of payment as the ship account and the bunker account were established in US$. Those amounts were paid from the ship account.

12 As the above observations of Sheppard J indicate, the fourth priority of claims, ahead of other in rem claims, will be claims by the mortgagee. As noted, I have determined that the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East does have a mortgage over the ship securing the advances made to the ship and its owners by the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. Its mortgage, although its validity was determined by the law of Kuwait (see The "Angel Bell" [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 491 at 495), is treated in the priority sequence on the same basis as a domestic mortgage. See Jackson DC, Enforcement of Maritime Claims (4th ed, LLP London, 2005) p 581. There has been no submission that I should not follow that principle.</text>

<tocase>Coltman v Chamberlain (1890) 25 QBD 328</tocase>
<text>18 In Meeson N, Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice (3rd ed, LLP, London 2003, at [10.68] the author quotes from Coltman v Chamberlain (1890) 25 QBD 328 in support of the proposition that a mortgage of a ship passed to the mortgagee under the word "ship" will cover:
 
 ... all articles necessary to the navigation of the ship or to the prosecution of the adventure, and without which no prudent person would sail, which were on board at the date of the mortgage and articles brought on board in substitution for them subsequently to the mortgage.
 

The Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East relies upon that text to support its claim, as well as upon Coltman 25 QBD 328. The mortgage of a "ship" included such articles, without needing to have regard to its "appurtenances" also mortgaged under the instrument in question.</text>

In The "Eurosun" and "Eurostar" [1993] 1 Lloyd's Rep 106 at 111, Sheen J said:
 
 The question whether the fuel oil was mortgaged as security for the loan is to be answered by construing the words of the mortgage. Nevertheless I cannot refrain from observing that there is something unreal in the concept of a bank manager being willing to accept an unspecified and variable amount of fuel oil as security for a loan, particularly when that fuel oil may be sold by the shipowners to charterers. If the lenders intended to accept fuel oil as part of their security, prudence would have dictated that the wording of the mortgage would include a reference specifically to fuel oil and that the deed of covenant would include a covenant not to sell the oil to a charterer.
 

I respectfully agree with his Lordship and adopt his approach.

21 The mortgage provides that the security given over certain vessels (including the ship) would include:
 
 ... all parts of the said vessels, licences and components including the engine with all the alterations and repairs that are made to it, safety equipment, and all appendages and annexes that may be found after the conclusion of the mortgage, in addition to the wreckage of the vessels in the event of their destruction.

22 Within that description, the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East contends that the ordinary meaning of the words "component" as part or element of a larger whole, especially a part of a machine or vehicle; "appendage" as a thing that is attached or added to something larger or more important; and "annexe" as an extra or subordinate part of a building jointed to or associated with the main building, providing additional space or accommodation all provide a means by which its mortgage included the bunkers of the ship. Whilst it is correct to say that those terms distinguish its mortgage from those considered in The "Eurosun"and "Eurostar" [1993] 1 Lloyd's Rep 106, I do not consider that the distinction enhances the contention.</text>

The text referred to above, Meeson at [10.73], also makes a similar comment based upon those decisions.

23 The words "component", "appendage", and "annexe" do not in their natural meaning extend to the bunkers, because each has the feature of being a physical part of or of being physically attached to or a functioning feature of the ship. It is not necessary, nor usual, that the bunkers to be part of the property of the ship owners. They are commonly the property of the charterers. In The "Pan Oak" [1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 36 at 39, Sheen J said:
 
 The problem which has arisen in this case can only arise when the lender lends more than the value of the ship. Most lenders do not contemplate lending more than the value of their security and would not want to look to variable security which would depend upon the quantity of oil in a ship when the ship is arrested, and upon whether the ship is on charter. For these, and perhaps many other reasons the bunkers are not usually part of the security for a mortgage.

24 In my judgment, therefore, the funds remaining in the bunker account should be distributed pro rata between those entities with an outstanding in rem judgment against the ship. The Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East is entitled to participate in that distribution to the extent that its judgment remains unsatisfied after it has received as a priority payment on the balance of the funds remaining in the ship account secured by its mortgage.

25 The amounts to be paid out proportionately cannot presently be calculated with exactitude. That is because, firstly, the amount of the claim of the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East upon which its proportion of the balance of the bunker account cannot be precisely known until the amount it receives from the ship account is known, and, secondly, because the precise amount available in the bunker account for distribution will only be known when a final date for payment is determined.</text>
