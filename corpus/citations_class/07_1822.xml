<tocase>Commonwealth v Amman Aviation [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/54.html</AustLII>
<text>119 In McRae , the plaintiffs recovered damages for the agreed purchase price together with the expenditure wasted in reliance on the promise that there was oil tanker in the locality of the reef. The wasted expenditure fell within the second rule in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341: see McRae at 413-415; see also The Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 88-89.

120 There may be some differences from McRae in the present case; in particular, a question arises as to whether it was impossible for Cairnsmore to establish what its profits would have been under the SBA: see Amman at 89. However, I am inclined to the view that the difficulties which arose from the move to Paragem tend in favour of the application of the wasted expenditure principle to the facts of this case.</text>

<tocase>I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/41.html</AustLII>
<text>125 The same amount is recoverable under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act : see I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [50] . Those damages are recoverable by Cairnsmore and Mr Howland against Bearsden. It is clear that the representations were made in trade or commerce and that reliance was established.

126 I will deal below with the question of the personal claim against Mr Hodge.

127 The representations made by Bearsden and Mr Hodge as to Bearsden's title to sell the business were eventually admitted. The admission was that oral and written submissions were made by Mr Hodge as second respondent, including on behalf of Bearsden, in terms of recitals A and B, cll 5.4, 6, 7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 9.2, 15.2, 19.1, 20, 24 and 25 of the SBA.</text>

<tocase>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1933/25.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The following issues are raised in the proceedings:
 
 
 (i) Whether upon the proper construction of the SBA, Bearsden contracted to sell the assets of the business in which it had no legal or beneficial interest.
 (ii) If so, whether Cairnsmore is entitled to damages for breach of contract in accordance with the principles stated by Dixon J and Fullagar J in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 409 415.
 (iii) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem constituted the exercise of a "right of title" by Bearsden under cl 5.4 of the SBA, thereby entitling Cairnsmore to a refund of the first instalment and damages for breach of contract. See McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457. 
 (iv) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem was to the disadvantage of Cairnsmore within the meaning of cl 9.1 of the SBA.
 (v) Whether Cairnsmore is entitled to recover damages either in contract or under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for expenditure incurred by it in reliance upon representations made by Bearsden in the SBA that it owned and carried on the business and had the right to sell it.
 (vi) Whether Cairnsmore and Mr Howland are entitled to recover against Mr Hodge by virtue of ss 6(3) or 75B of the Trade Practices Act .
 (vii) Whether, if Cairnsmore's contentions are not correct, Bearsden is entitled to recover payment of the second and third instalments of the purchase price as claimed by it in its cross claim.

107 This was a contract for the payment of the purchase price by instalments. It is well established that a purchaser is entitled to recover the instalments other than the deposit where the contract is not completed: McDonald v Dennys Lascelles at 477 to 478.

108 Furthermore, a termination for breach is not a rescission ab initio . Both parties are discharged from further performance but rights which have been unconditionally acquired are not divested: McDonald v Dennys Lascelles at 476 to 477. It follows in my view that the fees paid to Cairnsmore were irrecoverable under this principle.

109 The meaning of cl 9.1 is not entirely clear, however at very least the clause provides a "warranty" that Cairnsmore will not suffer an economic disadvantage by reason of any change of the identity of the AFS licensee from GPL to another entity.

110 Counsel for Cairnsmore devoted a great deal of attention to this issue. A large number of reasons were put forward to support a finding that Cairnsmore did suffer a disadvantage by reason of the move to Paragem.</text>

<tocase>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1950/12.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The following issues are raised in the proceedings:
 
 
 (i) Whether upon the proper construction of the SBA, Bearsden contracted to sell the assets of the business in which it had no legal or beneficial interest.
 (ii) If so, whether Cairnsmore is entitled to damages for breach of contract in accordance with the principles stated by Dixon J and Fullagar J in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 409 415.
 (iii) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem constituted the exercise of a "right of title" by Bearsden under cl 5.4 of the SBA, thereby entitling Cairnsmore to a refund of the first instalment and damages for breach of contract. See McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457. 
 (iv) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem was to the disadvantage of Cairnsmore within the meaning of cl 9.1 of the SBA.
 (v) Whether Cairnsmore is entitled to recover damages either in contract or under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for expenditure incurred by it in reliance upon representations made by Bearsden in the SBA that it owned and carried on the business and had the right to sell it.
 (vi) Whether Cairnsmore and Mr Howland are entitled to recover against Mr Hodge by virtue of ss 6(3) or 75B of the Trade Practices Act .
 (vii) Whether, if Cairnsmore's contentions are not correct, Bearsden is entitled to recover payment of the second and third instalments of the purchase price as claimed by it in its cross claim.

95 First, it is not what Bearsden contracted to sell under the SBA. Second, it would have been contrary to Part 7.6 of the Corporations Act , in particular s 916B(3). As in McCrae , the only proper construction of the SBA is that it included a promise by Bearsden that the subject matter of the agreement existed: see McRae at 410. It is plain that the subject matter did not exist because Bearsden did not own the business. The subject matter was not simply a business conducted at the premises, it was the business owned by Bearsden. It is true that Bearsden had the power to direct where the income stream that it received through HBN was paid, but it had no enforceable right against GPL because there was no contractual relationship between those parties.

96 In short, the commercial purpose which Bearsden sought to achieve could not have been put in place without an agreement between HBN and Cairnsmore. It would in my view have been necessary in addition for GPL to have been a party. The defect was not cured by Annexure B to the SBA, ie, the Agency Agreement on p 743 of Exhibit A. That document was legally ineffective (even if it was properly executed on behalf of HBN, which I doubt). This is because it entirely ignored the structure in place in the various agreements fully described in counsel's diagram annexed to my reasons for judgment.

97 This case therefore falls within the principles stated by Dixon and Fullagar JJ in McCrae at 409 to 411. Bearsden must pay damages for breach of its promise to give title.

119 In McRae , the plaintiffs recovered damages for the agreed purchase price together with the expenditure wasted in reliance on the promise that there was oil tanker in the locality of the reef. The wasted expenditure fell within the second rule in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341: see McRae at 413-415; see also The Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 88-89.

120 There may be some differences from McRae in the present case; in particular, a question arises as to whether it was impossible for Cairnsmore to establish what its profits would have been under the SBA: see Amman at 89. However, I am inclined to the view that the difficulties which arose from the move to Paragem tend in favour of the application of the wasted expenditure principle to the facts of this case.</text>

<tocase>Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/289.html</AustLII>
<text>134 There has been some debate in the cases as to whether liability under s 75B requires the accessory to know that the conduct of the principal is misleading or deceptive: see for example Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at [83] .

135 The question in the present case turns on Mr Hodge's knowledge.

136 Mr Hodge was an unsatisfactory witness. I cannot accept him as a witness of truth. He either could not or would not answer questions directly. He denied propositions that were put to him that were clearly supported by contemporaneous documents. His denials were in the teeth of the contemporaneous documentary record.

137 By contrast, I though that Mr Howland was a truthful witness. He did not have a good recollection of the detail but he did his best to answer honestly and directly. I prefer his evidence where it conflicts with that of Mr Hodge.

138 It is clear that Mr Hodge was aware of all the necessary elements. He made the representations and he was aware of the structure under which the business was established. In addition, the documents given to clients showed quite plainly that Mr Hodge informed them that HBN was the corporate representative of GPL and that Mr Hodge was the personal authorised representative of GPL.</text>

<text>98 Whether or not Cairnsmore relied on that breach when it gave notice of the termination of the SBA, it is open to Cairnsmore to rely on that breach in these proceedings: see Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Limited [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359.

99 I will deal later with the question of damages.

100 Clause 5.4 is to be construed in the light of the provisions of cll 6 and 7 of the SBA.</text>

<tocase>Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 39 SR (NSW) 632</tocase>
<text>116 It seems to me that although cl 9.1 speaks of a "warranty," it was in truth a condition of the SBA that Cairnsmore would not suffer a disadvantage: see Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 39 SR (NSW) 632 at 641-642.

117 This view is supported by the object and purpose of the SBA and the surrounding circumstances, including GPL's standing as a premium dealer and Mr Howland's concerns that he be protected against a move from GPL.

118 Accordingly, in my view Cairnsmore is entitled to terminate for breach of cl 9.1.</text>
