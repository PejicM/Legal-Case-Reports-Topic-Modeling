<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>58 Dr Carrick sought to support her complaint concerning the Committee's receipt of Dr Heap's report by reference to Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88. That case concerned the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to tell an applicant for a protection visa that it had received an unsolicited letter that made damaging allegations against him. It is not an authority which is of assistance to Dr Carrick who was at all relevant times fully aware of the content of Dr Heap's report.

59 The complaint that the Committee wrongly received into evidence and considered Dr Heap's report is not made out.

60 The Final Report discloses that the Committee had regard to one class of services provided by Dr Carrick, namely MBS item 30487 provided in association with one or more gastrointestinal endoscopic procedural items. It examined this class of services by employing a sample of the services included in the class as authorised by s 106K(1) of the Act. Dr Carrick contends that the sampling methodology used by the Committee for this purpose was not a sampling methodology specified in a determination made by the Minister under s 106K(3).</text>

<tocase>Daniel v Kelly (2003) 200 ALR 379</tocase>
<text>20 Dr Carrick placed particular reliance on the judgments of this Court, at first instance and on appeal, regarding an investigative referral decision made concerning a Dr Daniel ( Daniel v Kelly (2003) 200 ALR 379 (Ryan J); Kelly v Daniel [2004] FCAFC 14 ; (2004) 134 FCR 64 (Full Court)). In Daniel v Kelly Ryan J at [13] rejected the submission that, in the circumstances of that case, the investigative referral was a result of the operation of the Act with the consequence that no occasion arose for the exercise of a discretion by the Commission. His Honour went on at [25] to describe as 'plainly relevant to any decision to investigate Dr Daniel' the fact that the relevant conduct of Dr Daniel had already been the subject of counselling and review resulting in a decision to take no action at that time. On appeal the Full Court at [81] agreed that the Commission had a discretion under s 86 to make an investigative referral and that the Commission had proceeded on the erroneous assumption that it was required to make an investigate referral.

21 I reject Dr Carrick's submission that this case is on ' all fours ' with Daniel v Kelly. It is not suggested in this case that the Commission proceeded on the assumption that it was required to make an investigative referral. The correspondence considered in [24] and [28] below makes plain that the Commission appreciated that an investigative referral was discretionary.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/453.html</AustLII>
<text>22 Additionally, as North J, one of the members of the Full Court in Kelly v Daniel, explained in Freeman v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCA 453 at [54] :
 
 'The issue fatal to validity in Daniel was the failure of the Commission to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the fact that, apparently unknown to officers of the Commission responsible for making the referral, Dr Daniel's conduct had already been considered and the issues resolved between other officers of the Commission and Dr Daniel.' 
 

By contrast, the written communications between Dr Carrick and officers of the Commission between 14 December 2000 (the date of Dr Carrick's interview with Dr Lorenz) and 12 June 2002 indicated that significant issues between Dr Carrick and the Commission remained unresolved at the time of the Investigative Referral.</text>

34 I accept for present purposes that Kelly v Daniel [2004] FCAFC 14 ; 134 FCR 64 is authority for the proposition that, in making a decision under s 86(1), the Commission is bound to take into account the consideration, where applicable, that the conduct of the person under review has already been considered by the Commission and a decision communicated to the person that the conduct will not be further investigated. As identified above, that consideration was not pertinent in this case.</text>

<tocase>Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (2006) 90 ALD 49</tocase>
<text>75 A submission to the same effect was 'rejected out of hand' by Edmonds J in Mathews v Health Insurance Commission (2006) 90 ALD 49 at [40]. It is appropriate for me to follow the approach adopted by his Honour unless I am satisfied that his Honour was in error. I am not so satisfied. Indeed, in my respectful view, his Honour was plainly correct.

76 The sampling methodology prescribed by the Determination assumes an understanding of, and facility with, statistics. It is unlikely that the Minister intended that Committee members, rather than appropriately qualified statisticians, should undertake important statistical procedures. The obligation on a Committee to 'ensure' that the preliminary random sample is a random sample may, in my view, be met by the Committee satisfying itself that the preliminary random sample has been generated as a random sample by an appropriately qualified person. Nothing in the evidence establishes that the Committee did not take that step in this case.

77 I am not persuaded that it was necessary for the Committee to be given the full preliminary sample in the order of its original random selection, as argued by Dr Maxwell Stevenson, an expert statistician whose affidavit evidence was adduced by Dr Carrick. The responsibility of the Committee under s 106K and the Determination was not to engage in 'sound audit practice' , to use Dr Stevenson's expression, but rather to ensure that s 6 of the Determination was complied with.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>33 To substantiate her challenge that the Commission exercised the power under s 86(1) of the Act without taking into account relevant considerations Dr Carrick was required to:
 
 (a) identify a consideration that the Commission was bound to take into account in making its decision ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39); and
 (b) demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that the Commission did not take into account that consideration.

35 What other factors the Commission is bound to take into account in making a decision under s 86(1) are to be determined as a matter of statutory construction. As the Act does not expressly identify the considerations to be taken in account, they are to be implied from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act ( Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; 162 CLR 24 at 39-40).

36 It is not necessary for a decision to be reached in this case on whether the Commission was bound to take into account any of the following considerations:
 
 (a) that a counselling meeting had taken place between Dr Carrick and a Commission Medical Advisor at which Dr Carrick's referred conduct was discussed;
 (b) Dr Carrick's practice statistics had been reviewed later than the date of the counselling meeting; and
 (c) there had been some, albeit, in the Commission's view, insufficient, change in Dr Carrick's practice statistics since counselling. 

I am satisfied that the Commission was alert to, and took into account, each of the above considerations as each of them is referred to in the Investigative Referral under the heading 'Reasons for Investigative Referral' (see [16] above). The weight to be given to them was a matter for the Commission.

37 Having regard to the view that I have taken of the true tenor of the written and oral communications discussed above between Dr Carrick and the officers of the Commission, I am not persuaded that Dr Carrick has identified any consideration not identified in the Investigative Referral that the Commission was bound to take into account in making its decision under s 86(1) of the Act.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/196.html</AustLII>
<text>38 In any event, as Lander J, with whom Black CJ and Wilcox J agreed, observed in Oreb v Willcock [2005] FCAFC 196 ; (2005) 146 FCR 237 at [101] - [102] :
 
 '[T]the absence of a mention of those ... matters in the reasons does not mean that the Commission did not have regard to those matters. The reasons which must be given by the Commission under s 86(4)(b) are "the reasons why the Commission considers the person under review may have engaged in inappropriate practice". The Commission does not have to give reasons why it has decided to make an investigative referral but only the reasons why it considers the practitioner may have engaged in inappropriate practice. The purpose of the Commission's reasons is to identify the matters into which the Director needs to inquire. In my opinion, the reasons which were advanced by the Commission were appropriate having regard to the reasons which the Commission had to give. 
 
 In those circumstances, the appellant cannot, in my opinion, rely upon the Commission's failure to mention the ... matters to which the appellant referred for arguing that the Commission failed to have regard to them.'

39 Dr Carrick was not able to point to any evidence apart from the terms of the Investigative Referral itself to support her contention that the Commission did not take into account all relevant aspects of her conduct over the referral period (see [17] above).

40 The extent to which Dr Carrick ultimately pressed the claim that she was positively misled by Dr Lorenz on 14 December 2000 is unclear (see [19(e)] above). This claim was expanded upon in a written submission made by her to the Director which is annexed to an affidavit sworn by her in support of her application. In that written submission she drew attention to the fact that the statistics discussed during the interview related to the year ended 30 September 2000 while the referral period is 1 July 2000 to 31 June 2001; that is, to the fact that the referral period significantly overlapped with the period covered by the statistics discussed during the interview. She contended that in this circumstance it was farcical that the Investigative Referral stated:
 
 'The HIC determined there had been insufficient change to remove the overall concerns about the referred conduct above.'</text>

<tocase>Phan v Kelly [2007] FCA 269</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/269.html</AustLII>
<text>47 Appendix 2 to the Adjudicative Referral was a list of the first 40 randomly selected MBS item 30487 services (and the full medical records for the patients identified in that list) from the list of randomly selected MBS item 30487 services provided to the Director by the Commission. Dr Carrick's outline opening statement indicated that her case concerning the Adjudicative Referral was that the discretion of the Director to refer the matter to a Committee hearing miscarried because he included in his referral 'the already examined patient medical files of [Dr Carrick] for the Committee for it to examine again' (emphasis in original). This appears to be a re-run of an argument unsuccessfully advanced before Tamberlin J in Phan v Kelly [2007] FCA 269.

48 Section 93 of the Act governs the form and content of an adjudicative referral. Subject to s 93, the content and form of an adjudicative referral must comply with relevant guidelines made by the Minister under s 93(4). The Health Insurance (Professional Services Review Content and Form of Adjudicative Referrals) Guidelines 1999 ('the Guidelines') were made by the Minister under s 93(4).

49 Section 93(6) provides:
 
 'If the Director makes an adjudicative referral, the Director must: 
 
 
 
 (a) prepare a written report to the Committee, in respect of the services to which the referral relates, giving the reasons why the Director thinks that conduct by the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating the services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice; and 
 (b) attach the report to the adjudicative referral.'

66 As I understand Dr Carrick's submissions concerning the sampling methodology adopted by the Committee, she does not contend that the Committee breached any express requirement of the Determination. Rather she argues that it is necessarily implicit in the Determination that the Committee was required:
 
 'to find for itself and inspect a fresh pool of randomly selected medical services to examine, instead of examining a set of 30 from the 40 provided to them by the Director.' 
 

Again, as I understand it, this is a re-run of an argument unsuccessfully advanced before Tamberlin J in Phan [2007] FCA 269.

67 The evidence demonstrates that on 2 July 2002 the Director requested the Commission to select a random sample of 98 patient services from the total population of MBS item 30487 services rendered by Dr Carrick for the period 1 July 2000 - 30 June 2001. It is accepted that the Commission used a computer program to create a report which listed the names of 98 patients who had received a MBS item 30487 service from Dr Carrick randomly selected from the total population as required. The report discloses that it was produced on 29 July 2002 by the Analysis &amp; Evaluation Section of the Program Review Division of the Commission.

68 It is not disputed that the preliminary sample size of 98 patient services met the requirements of s 7 of the Determination. Nor is it disputed that before providing the list of randomly selected patient services to the Director, the Commission used the same computer program to randomly assign a new random number to each of the services in the preliminary random sample. It then re-sorted the services in the order corresponding to the new random numbers assigned to each service. The list of randomly selected services provided by the Commission to the Director was the list re-sorted in that order.

69 The exploratory sample which the Committee examined consisted of the first 30 services on the list of randomly selected services provided by the Commission to the Director. I accept the evidence of Professor Desmond Nicholls, which was not challenged, that these first 30 services were a sample selected randomly from the preliminary random sample as required by s 8 of the Determination.

70 The Director, by a written notice given under s 89B(2) of the Act, required Dr Carrick to produce to him original patient records for the first 40 patients listed on the random sample of 98 patient services provided to the Director by the Commission. The Director engaged Dr Heap to review the 40 medical records provided by Dr Carrick. Dr Heap reported that he did not believe that it was justified for Dr Carrick to charge any of the 40 patients for an MBS item 30487 service. The Director also obtained data which showed that Australia wide 7,800 claims were made for MBS item 30487 services during the referral period and that Dr Carrick provided 4,073 of these services. The next highest provider claimed 876 MBS item 30487 services.

79 The second error claimed to affect the methodology adopted by the Committee was that the preliminary random sample was not a random sample in the hands of the Committee because it had already been the subject of consideration by the Director. This argument was rejected by Tamberlin J in Phan [2007] FCA 269 at [52] . His Honour there observed:
 
 'In my view, the sample used in the present case was in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The evidence is that the Commission drew a preliminary random sample and that the Director required the production of records which he examined. He concluded, for the reasons given by him in his Report, that it would be appropriate for him to refer the matter to a Committee. In examining the material and completing his Report, the Director did not decide that there was inappropriate conduct. That determination was left for the Committee to make following a hearing and having regard to the evidence adduced at that hearing. It is not correct to suggest that the Director had found that the samples had in fact given rise to inappropriate conduct. The fact that the Director examined and considered the records and forwarded them to the Committee does not affect their randomness when they were considered afresh by the Committee. The sample items retained their character as random samples and were not skewed or biased so that the Committee's decision should be considered invalid.' (emphasis in original)

80 Again, I should follow the approach adopted by his Honour unless I am satisfied that his Honour was in error. I am not so satisfied. Indeed, in my respectful view, his Honour was correct.

81 The report of Dr Stevenson, parts of which I received by way of submission (O 10 r 1(2)(j) of the Federal Court Rules ), assumed a requirement for the conclusions arrived at by the Committee to be 'truly independent of those of the Director' . Dr Carrick argued that were this not the case, the conclusions would otherwise be ' unfair '. It is, of course, the case that a Professional Services Review Committee is obliged to make its own finding in respect of the conduct of the person under review; that is, a finding as to whether the conduct constituted engaging in inappropriate practice. However, as I understand the report of Dr Stevenson, he takes the view that, at least where a Committee places reliance on s 106K of the Act, the findings of the Committee must be arrived at by reference to samples of services not previously considered by the Director. Additionally Dr Stevenson places reliance on the notion of 'data snooping' in suggesting that the preliminary random sample did not satisfy the requirements of s 7 of the Determination. Data snooping can occur when a given set of data is used more than once for the purpose of inference.

82 The question of whether the findings of the Committee were required to be arrived at by reference to samples of services not previously considered by the Director is to be answered by reference to the Act. References to sound audit practice and notions of fairness are of only limited assistance in this regard. Section 93(6) of the Act provides that where the Director makes an adjudicative referral the Director must prepare and attach to the adjudicative referral:
 
 'a written report to the Committee, in respect of the services to which the referral relates, giving the reasons why the Director thinks that conduct by the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating the services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice' .
 

This statutory requirement suggests against any legislative intention that the conclusions arrived at by the Committee are to be arrived at by reference to evidence independent of that considered by the Director.

83 It is also significant in this regard that the Director is not authorised to make a finding that a person has engaged in inappropriate practice. Rather the role of the Director under Part VAA of the Act is as outlined in [12] above. A function of the Director under the scheme established by Part VAA is to ensure that only matters where the Committee could reasonably find that the person under review has engaged in inappropriate practice are referred to a Professional Services Review Committee.</text>

<tocase>Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1560.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Part VAA of the Act is entitled 'The Professional Services Review Scheme' . It is concerned to protect public revenues from abuse of the Medicare benefits system. It establishes a scheme whereby a medical practitioner's conduct in respect of services for which Medicare benefits are paid can be investigated to ascertain if it involves inappropriate practice. The operation of the scheme has been described in some detail in a number of other judgments of the Court. I do not consider it necessary to repeat that exercise. I refer by way of example to the description set out in Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280 at [5] - [61] .

9 Although Dr Carrick is not a specialist medical practitioner, nothing before this Court suggests that she is a 'general practitioner' within the meaning of the Act (see the definition of 'general practitioner' in s 3 of the Act and item 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Health Insurance (1998-99 General Medical Services Table) Regulations 1998 ). For that reason the relevant definition of ' inappropriate practice ' in her case is that contained in s 82(1)(d). That definition is as follows:
 
 'A practitioner engages in inappropriate practice if the practitioner's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services is such that a Committee could reasonably conclude that: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (d) if the practitioner rendered or initiated the referred services as neither a general practitioner nor a specialist but as a member of a particular profession the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of the members of that profession.'

10 It is sufficient here to note that the above definition, and the other definitions of inappropriate practice in s 82 of the Act, make plain that the scheme is concerned with professional conduct that a practitioner's professional peers would consider unacceptable. Where a judgment in that regard is required, it is made by a Professional Services Review Committee to which the Director has made an adjudicative referral under s 93. Section 95(2) ensures that the members of a Professional Services Review Committee are practitioners who belong to the profession in which the practitioner was practising when he or she rendered or initiated the referred services.

14 As mentioned above, on 28 June 2002 the Commission, by its delegate Dr Houston, made the Investigative Referral. No criticism has been made of the instrument of referral although it appears not to have been drafted in accordance with the construction placed on s 86 and s 87 of the Act by Finn J in Pradhan [2001] FCA 1560 ; 125 FCR 280 at [14] - [17] . As his Honour observed, s 81 defines 'referred services' relevantly to mean 'the services particulars of which are contained in the referral in accordance with paragraph 86(4)(a)' . That paragraph encompasses all services rendered or initiated during the referral period by, relevantly, the person under review.

15 The Investigative Referral specified particularly Dr Carrick's conduct in connection with the rendering of certain services identified by reference to MBS item numbers including MBS item 30487. MBS item 30487 represents small bowel intubation with biopsy.

16 The instrument of referral set out the reasons why the Commission considered Dr Carrick may have engaged in inappropriate practice as follows:
 
 'Within the scope of Dr Carrick's conduct in connection with the rendering or initiating of the above services, the HIC is concerned that, as indicated by her practice profile, Dr Carrick may have: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; rendered or initiated services that were not necessary; 
 &#8226; not provided an appropriate level of clinical input to the services; 
 &#8226; not provided appropriate 'professional services' to her patients, or 
 &#8226; not satisfied the requirements of the relevant items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule Book and the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. 
 
 
 
 
 The concerns of the HIC have been identified and analysed by: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a review of Dr Carrick's practice statistics; 
 &#8226; a comparison of those statistics with the data concerning the practice of all active medical practitioners and surgery non-specialists in Australia; 
 &#8226; a counselling meeting between a HIC Medical Adviser and Dr Carrick where the above referred conduct was discussed; 
 &#8226; a report of that meeting between the HIC Medical Adviser and Dr Carrick ... ; and 
 &#8226; a review of Dr Carrick's practice statistics since counselling. 
 
 
 
 The HIC determined there had been insufficient change to remove the overall concerns about the referred conduct above. 
 
 Taking into account the concerns which are outlined above, the HIC is of the view that Dr Carrick may be engaging in inappropriate practice within the meaning of section 82 of the Act and that the conduct should be referred for consideration by the Director of Professional Services Review.'
