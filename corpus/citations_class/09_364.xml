<tocase>Hennessy v Wright (No 2) (1890) 24 QBD 445</tocase>
<text>The law is clear that a subpoena cannot issue to facilitate "fishing" by a party. Of particular relevance in the circumstances of this case are comments of Jordan CJ in Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 575 where his Honour observed: 
 In the absence of special circumstances... A party is no more entitled to use a subpoena duces tecum than he is a summons for interrogatories, for the purpose of "fishing", i.e. endeavouring, not to obtain evidence to support his case but to discover whether he has a case at all : Hennessy v Wright ... (emphasis added)

Indeed it is useful to also note comments of Lord Esher MR in Hennessy v Wright (No 2) (1890) 24 QBD 445 at 448 where his Lordship said in the context of interrogatories and "fishing" by the plaintiff in that case: 
 In other words, the plaintiff wishes to maintain his questions, and to insist upon answers to them, in order that he may find out something of which he knows nothing now, which might enable him to make a case of which he has no knowledge at present...

Significantly, the key issue arising in the notice of motion filed 17 November 2008 is whether Habitare Pty Ltd and other parties should be joined as respondents to the substantive proceedings. The applicant candidly concedes that the purpose of the subpoena is to obtain further evidence:

On balance, I consider that the applicant in this case has established that the purpose of the subpoenas is to obtain further evidence relevant to the notice of motion filed 17 November 2008, that this is a legitimate forensic purpose, and that the claim cannot be categorised as "fishing". I form this view because:

Accordingly, I consider that the applicant has demonstrated a legitimate forensic purpose for seeking issue of subpoenas in relation to the documents sought, and that the orders sought by the notice of motion before the Court cannot be characterised as "fishing". "On the cards"

Is it "on the cards" that the documentation sought by the applicant will materially assist the applicant's case in relation to the notice of motion filed 17 November 2008?</text>

<tocase>Hughes v WA Cricket Association (1986) 66 ALR 541</tocase>
<text>The practice whereby the Court gives leave for subpoenas to be issued against a third party pursuant to O 27A has survived the introduction of O 15A Federal Court Rules providing for orders of the Court relating to non-party discovery. In relation to a third party, it is clear that a subpoena duces tecum may be directed to a third party prior to trial: 
 where it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding that a person produce documents before the date of hearing of the application.

<tocase>The Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564</tocase>
<text>Against a third party however a subpoena is not to be used as a substitute for discovery. As Jordan CJ observed in The Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW): 
 A writ of subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to a stranger to the cause or to a party. If it be addressed to a stranger, it must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced. A subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his possession or power relating to a particular subject matter. It is not legitimate to use a subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain what would be in effect discovery of documents against a person who, being a stranger, is not liable to make discovery. A stranger to the cause ought not to be required to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant... (at 573)

The law is clear that a subpoena cannot issue to facilitate "fishing" by a party. Of particular relevance in the circumstances of this case are comments of Jordan CJ in Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 575 where his Honour observed: 
 In the absence of special circumstances... A party is no more entitled to use a subpoena duces tecum than he is a summons for interrogatories, for the purpose of "fishing", i.e. endeavouring, not to obtain evidence to support his case but to discover whether he has a case at all : Hennessy v Wright ...
