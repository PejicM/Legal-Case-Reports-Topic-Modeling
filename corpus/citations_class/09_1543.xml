<text>This Court may permit new grounds to be raised on appeal which were not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court. But there are very real reasons why it should not too readily do so, including: the fact that the relevant jurisdiction conferred on this Court is an appellate jurisdiction; the fact that this Court, in exercising that appellate jurisdiction, is entitled to the not inconsiderable benefit of the reasons for decision of a Federal Magistrate in respect to the issues sought to be agitated by a party to the proceeding; the principle that a party who has had a case resolved against him should usually not be permitted on appeal to raise a completely new or different case to that previously advanced; the principle that to permit a whole new case to be run on appeal has the potential to undermine the appellate process by rendering the trial process almost irrelevant; the fact that there is a legitimate public interest in public law matters being resolved in a timely and efficient manner and that the Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely resolution of applications for protection visas; and the fact that the High Court, in the event that an application for special leave to appeal is granted, is entitled to the benefit of a decision at first instance on the arguments sought to be resolved and to this Court's reasons for decision in respect to the same issues on appeal. To pursue any other course is to shift to the High Court the appellate role which it is the responsibility of this Court to discharge. 
These are but some of the matters that have been referred to in earlier decisions of this Court: e.g. Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 at [62] , [2001] FCA 929 ; 192 ALR 71 at 86 per Gyles J; SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 per Lander J; SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 598 per Spender J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1332.html</AustLII>
<text>The now Appellant's ability to enter Singapore was said by the Tribunal to derive from his right to permanent residence in Singapore. His passport thus bore the following endorsement: 
 
 A permanent resident requires a Re-entry Permit if he/she wishes to travel out of Singapore. A valid Re-entry Permit enables him/her to return to Singapore as a permanent resident. 
 

 
It also bore the following additional endorsement:
 
 Re-Entry Permit 
 

 
 
 This permit is valid for multiple journeys within five years from date hereof provided the travel document is valid. The holder is authorised to re-enter Singapore for permanent residence so long as this permit is valid. 
 

 
The date of the endorsement is 27 November 2006. It may further be noted that the Tribunal's reasons further record:
 
 
 [74] ... When questioned on this, the applicant acknowledged that he had a right of return to Singapore as he is a permanent resident there. Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the applicant has a right of entry and residence in Singapore at this time. 
 

 
No submissions were advanced in the present appeal that the Appellant's ability to enter Singapore was not a " right " within the meaning of and for the purposes of s 36(3): cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 , 116 FCR 154 ; SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 , 171 FCR 145.</text>

<tocase>SZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 996</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/996.html</AustLII>
<text>On 1 July 2009 the Appellant filed an Application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. The grounds upon which that Application was advanced were expressed as follows (without alteration): The Tribunal denied procedural fairness at the time of the assessment of applicant claim The Refugee Review Tribunal's decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of the applicant's circumstances of the decision.
 
That Court addressed those grounds and dismissed the Application on 23 September 2009: SZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 996. In the course of resolving these two grounds, the Federal Magistrate also set forth the Tribunal's analysis of s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the " Migration Act ") and its application to the now Appellant.

A Notice of Appeal was thereafter filed with this Court on 13 October 2009. The Grounds of Appeal were expressed as follows (without alteration): 
 
 The Tribunal made a jurisdictional error 'by failing to apply the correct test to determine that there was a real chance of persecution' in assessing whether the appellant's fear of persecution was well-founded. 
 

 
 
 His Honor committed an error of law in dismissing that the decision involved a jurisdictional error of law involving an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law to the facts of the case found by the Refugee Review Tribunal. The Tribunal decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the Migration Act or the regulations.

The Appellant appeared before this Court on 23 November 2009 unrepresented, although he did have the benefit of an interpreter.</text>

<text>It must always be recognised, however, that leave to raise a ground of appeal which was not previously relied upon may be granted where " it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ": VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] .

The reference in the Grounds of Appeal to the Tribunal's alleged failure " to apply the correct test to determine that there was a real chance of persecution " permitted (perhaps) of some ambiguity.

On one view, the Ground could be construed as a broadly expressed challenge to: the correct construction and application of s 36 of the Migration Act . 
On another view, the Ground could be construed as a challenge to:
 the findings made by the Tribunal in respect to the " chance of persecution " confronting the now Appellant. 
It is not considered that the alternative manner of expressing the Grounds of Appeal raises any different issue.</text>
