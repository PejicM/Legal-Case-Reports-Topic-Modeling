<tocase>Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd [2004] WASC 241</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2004/241.html</AustLII>
<text>For the purposes of this proceeding, I will also assume that the investments in the Promissory Notes were subject to the requirements of managed investment schemes under the Corporations Law. There was considerable debate before me as to this question. In light of the view I have come to on other issues, it is unnecessary for me to come to a final view on this question. My own tentative view is that the correct contention is that the issue of the Promissory Notes did not form part of a managed investment scheme. The arguments not accepted by Simmonds J in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd [2004] WASC 241 seem to have considerable force.

It seems to me that all that is involved here is the issue of promissory notes by a corporation with particular credit worthy characteristics and with a particular financing structure, which included the provision of certain securities for the lending of monies to investors. Each investor was offered and accepted a promissory note. All that was offered and acquired was the entitlement to payment of interest and repayment of capital in accordance with the promissory note, and no more or less. This is not the acquiring of rights to benefits produced by any 'scheme'.

As I have said, I do not find it necessary to go further into this matter it would involve an analysis of the decision in Emu Brewery Mezzanine WASC 241, and possibly, the decisions of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 157 FCR 229 and Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358 , and the question of the extent to which I should follow those decisions even if I considered any of them to be error.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/60.html</AustLII>
<text>It is important to analyse the conduct and statements of PIR as a whole, taking into account disclaimers and other circumstances showing the true character of the conduct and statements themselves: see eg Campbell (2009) HCA 25 at [130] and Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2009/25.html</AustLII>
<text>Further, a disclaimer was included in the PIR reports. I accept that disclaimers may not be effective to absolve a maker of a statement from liability for misleading or deceptive conduct or liability under s 53 of the TPA: see eg Petera Pty Ltd v EAJ Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 277 ; (1985) 7 FCR 375. However, in this case there is not just the disclaimer. Contrary to the contention of Wealthcare, I do not regard the position as analogist to the attempted reliance upon the disclaimer in John G Glass Real Estate Pty Ltd v Karawi Constructions Pty Ltd 1993 ATPR 41-249. The context of all the statements in the PIR report referred to above indicated the limited basis of the information being put forward by PIR: see Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd (2009) HCA 25 at [29] - [30] .

In coming to the view that Mr Roberts did not rely upon the alleged misrepresentations I am mindful of the comments made by the High Court in Campbell (2009) HCA 25 at [143] . The essential question is one of causation. It may be artificial to talk in terms of reliance in determining what would have occurred if the true position were known. Nevertheless causation and reliance are related concepts (see eg Heydon , Trade Practices Law (2008) vol 2 at [11.720]). In this proceeding, I have come to the conclusion that there was no causal connection between the alleged misrepresentations and the actions of Wealthcare, because there was no reliance in fact upon the alleged misrepresentations.</text>

<tocase>Digi Tech (Aust) Ltd v Brand [2004] NSWCA 58</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2004/58.html</AustLII>
<text>There may be an issue as to the whether there is an inconsistency between the cases relied upon by Wealthcare and Digi Tech (Aust) Ltd v Brand [2004] NSWCA 58 at [147] - [160] , but this does not need further consideration.

As Wealthcare did not rely on the alleged representations in the PIR report, no 'indirect causation' can arise. Put another way, it cannot be said that Wealthcare's reliance on the PIR reports was 'a cause' of Dartberg's investing because there was no reliance at all by Wealthcare to find any 'indirect causation'.

For the above reasons, the Court will order: The cross-claim be dismissed. The parties confer as to the appropriate order to make as to costs, and if no agreement can be reached, file and serve within 14 days any submissions as to costs.
 I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.

<tocase>Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/922.html</AustLII>
<text>The main claims made by the plaintiff Dartberg Pty Limited ('Dartberg') against Wealthcare related to investments made by Dartberg on the recommendation of Wealthcare in promissory notes issued by two companies Market Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd ('Market Street') and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd ('York Street'). Each of those companies was within the Westpoint Group of companies which collapsed. A convenient sketch of the background to the raising of monies by way of the promissory notes and the collapse of Westpoint is to be found in the judgment of Finkelstein J in Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358.

The primary claim between Dartberg and Wealthcare was settled by a settlement agreement dated 23 June 2008 which provided for payment by Wealthcare of the sum of $350,000 inclusive of interest and costs to Dartberg.

Wealthcare now seek damages against PIR in the amount of $350,000 plus costs incurred in defending the claim brought against Wealthcare by Dartberg.

As I have said, I do not find it necessary to go further into this matter it would involve an analysis of the decision in Emu Brewery Mezzanine WASC 241, and possibly, the decisions of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 157 FCR 229 and Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358 , and the question of the extent to which I should follow those decisions even if I considered any of them to be error.
