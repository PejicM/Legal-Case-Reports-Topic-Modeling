<text>1 On 20 March 2008 I delivered reasons for judgment in this matter ( Tosich v Tasman Investment Management Limited [2008] FCA 377) and stood the matter over in order to consider the orders to be made and to deal with costs. Terms used in these reasons (if otherwise undefined or unexplained) are to be understood by reference to that earlier judgment. A statement of issues agreed and disputed has been provided by parties. The disputed issues requiring some determination are issues 9 15.

2 As to issue 9, whether Tosich is entitled to costs against Tasman Investment and Warne, I can see no proper basis by which the successful plaintiff should be deprived of his costs. Those costs would not include the period when he was not a plaintiff. The fact that Tosich may have been effectively funded by All Saints and the proceeding organised in a way that would enable the cross-claim to be pursued is not to the point. Even if so, that would only put him in the same position as any other plaintiff in such circumstances, including a plaintiff whose case is conducted and funded by an insurer. There is no substance to the argument that the matter should have been settled by payment. Even if that were so, that would not be to the disadvantage of Tosich. As I mention later, in the event, the necessity for litigation was, in one sense, caused by Aon. I cannot see that Aon has any legitimate interest in any orders between All Saints and the defendants at this point.

3 Issue 10, allowance for contingences. It seems to me that paragraph 10(a) is correct. It can be calculated in accordance with paragraph 17of Aon's submissions.</text>
