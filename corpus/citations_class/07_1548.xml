<text>4 In support of the appropriateness of that figure, I am invited to approach what is put forward along the lines discussed by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993, [2004] FCAFC 72. That, of course, was a case under a different Act from that which is involved here, and an Act with different objectives. However, insofar as it dealt with the manner in which the Court should approach a statutory penalty where there is an agreement between the parties as to the appropriate penalty, that decision does provide appropriate guidance. I have also been referred to other authorities dealing more closely with questions of occupational health and safety including the recent case of Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia (2007) 162 IR 407, [2007] FCA 662 , where Madgwick J looked at a number of the factors which have been regarded as relevant by courts dealing with similar legislation in other jurisdictions.</text>
