<tocase>Bal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 189 ALR 566 </tocase>
<text>18 The Federal Magistrate held that reg 2.07 only requires substantial compliance with the directions in Form 866, not strict compliance (cf Bal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 189 ALR 566; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393). The Federal Magistrate held that significantly more than the "bare bones" of the appellant's claims were provided with the protection visa application and that there had therefore been substantial compliance.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v WAIK (2003) 79 ALD 152</tocase>
<text>34 Section 47 is included in Subdiv AA. It follows that non-compliance by the Minister with s 47(3) does not mean that the decision to refuse to grant the visa is not valid. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v WAIK (2003) 79 ALD 152, the Full Court was concerned with an application for a protection visa which was said to have been signed by a person under the age of 18 and therefore was not a valid application because it was not completed in accordance with the directions on the form (Form 866). The Full Court said at [29]-[31]:
 
 29 However, s 69(1) is explicit so far as the requirements of subdiv AA and subdiv AB are concerned. In the light of s 69, it cannot be said that the application for a protection visa signed by the Applicant was a nullity simply because he did not complete it in accordance with the directions contained on it. No suggestion was made on behalf of the Applicant that he did not understand the nature of the application or that he did not have the capacity, even if he was under 18, to make an application for a protection visa. The only contention was that, because the application form was not completed in accordance with the directions contained on it, it was not a valid application by reason of the operation of reg 2.07(3) and that, accordingly, the Minister was prohibited, by s 47(2), from considering the application since it was not a valid application.
 
 30 If an application that is not a valid application for the purposes of s 46 is considered pursuant to s 65, the resultant decision is preserved by s 69. The decision of the Minister's delegate purporting to reject the application is a valid decision, even if it involved a contravention of s 47, because the decision was rendered valid by the operation of s 69(1): see Thayananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 831 ; (2001) 113 FCR 297 at 33 [26] and Soondur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 324 ; (2002) 122 FCR 578 at 593 [49] .
 
 31 The Tribunal had jurisdiction to review the decision of the Minister's delegate under s 411(1)(c) because it was a decision to refuse to grant a protection visa. The fact that the Minister was prohibited by s 47(2) from considering the application, assuming that it was not a valid application, does not mean there was no decision within the meaning of s 411(1)(c). Whether or not the Minister was prohibited from considering the application, the Minister's delegate did so and made a decision to refuse a protection visa. There was no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal even if the Applicant was under 18 and the application was not a valid application within the meaning of s 46 of the Act.
 

That decision is both on point and binding.</text>

<tocase>NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/199.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The Federal Magistrate held that the appellant signed the statutory declaration although she was not aware she was signing a statutory declaration. He found that she did not read or speak English and that the statutory declaration was not translated to her. The Federal Magistrate held that as the appellant had an agent who was authorised to act for her at the time the form was completed and lodged, and that the appellant signed the form in three different places, there was substantial compliance, notwithstanding any deficiencies in the completion of the statutory declaration (cf NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199). In addition, he held that Parliament could not have intended such strict compliance, that the deficiencies noted in the statutory declaration would invalidate the application. He found the protection visa application to be valid. There was, therefore, no jurisdictional error.

20 In addition, the Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal decision was a privative clause decision and, for that reason as well, the application had to be dismissed. That would, of course, follow from his first finding that there was no jurisdictional error. In the further alternative, he held that had he found any jurisdictional error, he would not have been minded to grant relief in the circumstances of the case as "the applicant effectively sat on her hands for three years after she made her protection visa application, doing very little to follow it up."

21 Finally, he noted that the migration agent had "handled the applicant's protection claim in a most unsatisfactory and unprofessional way" and therefore directed the Registrar of the Court to refer the papers in this matter to the Migration Agents Registration Authority.

35 A similar result was reached in NAWZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199. In that case, the Full Court said at [17]-[18]:
 
 17 We do not consider that the requirement in Reg 2.07 that the approved form must be completed 'in accordance with any directions on it' necessitates that any departure from those directions spells invalidity for an application. It is unlikely to have been the purpose of the legislation: cf Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390-391; to require the automatic invalidity of a visa application that an applicant has caused another to complete: cf s 98; but which is unsigned, for example, because of the paralysis of the applicant or, for that matter, of the oversight of the applicant or of his or her agent: cf Ly v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 15 at [32] .
 
 18 We do not consider that the irregular manner of filling in and signing of the false application resulted in the invalidity of the application. It was a false application but it was, in formal terms, a valid application.</text>

<tocase>SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/35.html</AustLII>
<text>27 In this case, there is no suggestion that the final application submitted to the delegate contained other than the substance of the appellant's complaints. This is also not a case like SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 , where the appellant was advised of the hearing and advised not to attend. Although she said she did not receive the invitation to hearing, the evidence was that it was sent to both her agent and herself. The letter sent to her was not returned.

28 The only question in this case is whether the signing of the blank application means that the application was invalid.

29 Section 47(1) of the relevant Act requires the Minister to consider a valid application for a visa. Section 47(3) precludes the Minister from considering an application that is not a valid application. Section 65 requires the Minister, after considering a valid application for a visa, to grant the visa (s 65(1)(a)) or refuse to grant the visa (s 65(1)(b)). Section 46 addresses the requirements for a valid application for a visa. Regulation 2.07(3) of the Regulations provides that an applicant must complete an approved form in accordance with any directions on the form. The prescribed form for a Protection (Class XA) visa is Form 866. That form provides for a statutory declaration to be completed by the applicant.

30 The Minister contended that the failure of the appellant to complete the form did not mean that the application was not valid. Section 98 provides that a non-citizen is taken to have filled out his or her application form "if he or she causes it to be filled in or if it is otherwise filled in on his or her behalf."

31 In this case the application was filled out by the appellant's migration agent's secretary from information supplied by the appellant. I think the Minister's contention in that regard must be accepted. The application may be taken to have been filled in by the applicant.

32 The appellant said in her submissions to this Court that she signed the blank application in the presence of the migration agent's secretary. In her evidence before the Federal Magistrate she suggests, without making it clear, that she signed the blank application in the migration agent's presence. The appellant's signature is witnessed by a person who has identified himself or herself as a "JP". The migration agent did not witness the appellant's signature. However, there is no evidence that the migration agent's secretary is not that person or not a "JP". There is, therefore, no evidence that the application was not signed in accordance with the form's own instruction.

33 Even if there were, the Minister says that the decision made by the delegate of the Minister and the Tribunal are still valid. Section 69 of the Act provides:
 
 
 (1) Non-compliance by the Minister with Subdivision AA or AB or section 494D in relation to a visa application does not mean that a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa is not a valid decision but only means that the decision might have been the wrong one and might be set aside if reviewed.
 
 (2) If the Minister deals with a visa application in a way that complies with Subdivision AA, AB and this Subdivision, the Minister is not required to take any other action in dealing with it.</text>

<text>18 The Federal Magistrate held that reg 2.07 only requires substantial compliance with the directions in Form 866, not strict compliance (cf Bal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 189 ALR 566; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393).

<tocase>Wu v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 64 FCR 245</tocase>
<text>36 The appellant did not have to strictly comply with reg 2.07 to create a valid application. Substantial compliance was sufficient: Bal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs 189 ALR 156; Wu v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 64 FCR 245.

37 It follows that the appellant's application was a valid application. It follows that both the delegate's decision and the Tribunal's decision on review were authorised by the Act. That was the conclusion of the Federal Magistrate. No error has been demonstrated.

38 The appeal must be dismissed and the appellant must pay the respondent's costs.
