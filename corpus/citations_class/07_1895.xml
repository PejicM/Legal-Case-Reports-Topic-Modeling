<tocase>Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1358.html</AustLII>
<text>17 And finally, there are observations by Heerey J in Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 , which are apposite in the context of the affidavit material filed in the present application. Heerey J said of the case before him at [17]:
 
 ... Mr Meyers has filed a substantial amount of affidavit material sworn by himself and others. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the issue is not whether his version of events is more plausible than Andi-Co's, but whether the alleged debts are the subject of genuine disputes and whether the alleged offsetting claims are genuine, that is to say, real and authentic as opposed to false, illegitimate, phoney, counterfeit and false. Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits.

18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies.

19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003.</text>

<tocase>Fleur De Lys Pty Ltd v Jarrett (2004) 51 ACSR 238</tocase>
<text>55 Such an order was made by Hely J in Fleur De Lys Pty Ltd v Jarrett (2004) 51 ACSR 238.

56 The application by the plaintiff seeks an order for costs on an indemnity basis, relying on the fact that its solicitor had corresponded with the solicitor for the defendant indicating that the plaintiff claimed that it had a cross demand for damages for infringement of patents. The defendant nonetheless persisted in resisting the setting aside of the statutory demand.

57 In my opinion, it is not appropriate that there be an order for costs on an indemnity basis.</text>

<tocase>Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2006/518.html</AustLII>
<text>16 Austin J in Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518 said:
 
 [20] Effectively, the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is an offsetting claim is the same as the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is a genuine dispute between the alleged debtor and the party claiming to be creditor. The most effective cited description of the standard for establishing a genuine dispute is a passage in the judgment of McLelland CJ in Eq in Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787. There, his Honour said that the expression "genuine dispute" connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of considerations as the "serious question to be tried" criterion which arises in an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. 
 
 [21] It is of fundamental importance for parties to proceedings of this kind to understand that the court does not enter into the merits of any dispute between the parties. The court merely satisfies itself, to the standard described by McLelland CJ in Eq, that the dispute, or the assertion of an offsetting claim, is "genuine". If it is, then the statutory demand procedure is out of place. The whole purpose of the reforms introduced to corporate insolvency law, when the present Pt 5.4 was introduced, was to remove litigation about disputed claims from the winding up process. That is why courts have said, time and again, that if a creditor is aware that there is a dispute, asserted on behalf of the alleged debtor with sufficient plausibility to meet that relatively low threshold described by his Honour, issuing a statutory demand is wholly inappropriate. The correct course is to have the dispute resolved by proceedings asserting the debt.</text>

<tocase>Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284</tocase>
<text>40 Having regard to the expert evidence of Mr Fox, the claims are, it seems to me, genuine claims put forward in good faith, and which are more than mere assertion. The claims are seriously disputed, as the expert evidence of Mr Collins demonstrates. Without looking too deeply at the issues of validity and infringement, the claims of the plaintiff in respect of damages for infringement are such that they have " some real chance of success ", to use the words of Young J in Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284 at 289.

41 In my opinion, the conclusion that there is an offsetting claim in respect of the costs orders made by the Court on 9 August 2004 are even stronger.

42 On that day, the Court ordered that the decision of the AAT to affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents to decline an extension of time was set aside, and the matter was remitted to the AAT for consideration according to law. The Court ordered that the second respondent pay the costs of the applicant to be taxed if not agreed.</text>

<tocase>Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 743</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2001/743.html</AustLII>
<text>15 Palmer J in Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 743 at [18] said:
 
 In my opinion, a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of CA s 459H (1) and (2) means a claim on a cause of action advanced in good faith, for an amount claimed in good faith. 'Good faith' means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful. In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss, the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated. If such evidence is entirely lacking, the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s 459H.</text>

<tocase>Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362</tocase>
<text>10 The expression " genuine claim " was considered by Hayne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362, where his Honour said:
 
 ... any application to set aside a statutory demand must be made very quickly; it must be made within 21 days. Second, the statute contemplates a summary procedure, the only outcome of which will be an order affecting the statutory demand, not an order or judgment declaring a debt to be owing or not to be owing or ordering payment of any money sum. Third, the only significance that the statutory demand has is that if there is a failure to comply with it then the company is deemed to be insolvent. Thus the demand is no more than a precursor to an application for winding up in insolvency. Fourth, an application to wind up in insolvency must be determined within 6 months (unless the court is satisfied that special circumstances justify an extension of that time): s 459R. Firth, on the hearing of the application to wind up, the company may not oppose the application on grounds that it might have taken in any application to set aside the demand, unless those grounds are material to proving that the company is solvent.

11 Hayne J then said:
 
 These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute. All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute.</text>

<tocase>Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601</tocase>
<text>12 To like effect are the observations of Thomas J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601, where his Honour said at 605-606:
 
 There is little doubt that Division 3 is intended to be a complete code which prescribes a formula that requires the Court to assess the position between the parties and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim. That is not to say that the Court will examine the merits or settle the dispute. The specified limits of the Court's examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there is a "genuine claim".</text>

<tocase>Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525</tocase>
<text>27 Litigation involving those petty patents in the Federal Court [(1999) 47 IPR 525] resulted in the plaintiff losing on the issue of entitlement, Cooper J otherwise being satisfied that the invention was a manner of new manufacture and was also novel, inventive, and useful.

28 Mr Fox says: 
 
 
 5. GST [the plaintiff] is also the Patentee of three more recent patents ("the three new patents") which also derive from application No. 85236/91 as divisional either directly or indirectly, those patents being No. 780782 (32815/95), No. 781173 (46033/01), and No. 781174 (43779/01) and all three new patents relate to the same "invention" as the two petty patents previously mentioned. In fact, the claims of patent No: 781174 are identical to the claims of one of the petty patents, namely, No: 645740. The claims of patent No: 781173 are identical to the claims of the other petty patent, namely, No: 662284.

29 The tenor of his evidence is that those commercially sold water meter assemblies infringe the patents of the plaintiff.</text>
