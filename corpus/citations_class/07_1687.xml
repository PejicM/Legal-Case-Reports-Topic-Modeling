<text>58 In my opinion orders giving effect to the proposed replacements of the various liquidators, administrators and trustees can and should be made. In relation to the application under the Trustees Act I regard that application as falling within the accrued jurisdiction of the Court by reason of the close connection between the Creditors' Trusts and the Deeds of Company Arrangement to which they related. The replacement of the trustees arises out of the same set of events as has given rise to the application for the appointment of new liquidators and deed administrators. Although the term "the Court" in s 77 of the Trustees Act is defined as the Supreme Court of Western Australia, this Court may exercise the jurisdiction as part of its federal jurisdiction in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559.

59 I do not consider it necessary to make the various declarations of vacancy which were sought in the originating applications. Moreover, in my opinion, the text of the letters proposed to be sent to the creditors should not be framed so as to give the appearance that any of the liquidators, administrators or trustees has been removed by order of the Court.

60 So far as the costs are concerned, I have had regard to the submissions of the plaintiffs that they should be treated as costs in the liquidations, deed administrations and trusteeships affected by these orders. It was submitted that the reorganisation should be regarded as an incident of the administrations and should, in effect, be part of their overhead costs. I do not accept that submission. In my opinion it is quite inappropriate that costs flowing from a voluntary restructuring of the firm whose members have assumed these various offices should effectively be visited upon creditors. I can see no reasonable basis upon which the orders sought could properly be made. The costs orders will be refused and I will make orders to make it clear that these costs are not recoverable out of the assets of the companies or trusts affected by them. 

 I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.

The guide is numbered Regulatory Guide 82 and was published in May 2005. The regulatory guide is quoted as an explanation of the creditors' trust in Ford's Principles of Corporations Law , (Butterworths) Part VII Chapter 26 at [26.200]. Creditors' trusts have been helpfully discussed in Heaver-Wren T, "DOCA Termination through Creditors' Trust Deeds" (2004) 12 Insolv LJ 117-120; see also McKenzie R, "Creditors' Trusts and the ASIC Guidelines" (2005) 17(3) Australian Insolvency Journal 4-6; Proudman D, "Some Issues Surrounding Creditors' Trust Deeds Parts 1 and 2 " (2005) 6 INSLB 1-5 and 31-34. The mechanism has been touched on in the Supreme Court decisions: Ian Charles Francis and Michael Patrick Joseph Ryan as Trustees of The West Australian Shed Commercial Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed and West Australian Shed Co Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed [2003] WASC 39 (Pullin J); Open Telecommunications Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2003] NSWSC 1198 (Hamilton J) and Rupert Co v Chameleon Mining (2006) 24 ACLC 635 (Austin J).

50 In Open Telecommunications Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2003] NSWSC 1198 a deed administrator applied to Hamilton J for directions under s 447D of the Act that he would be justified in executing and giving effect to a varied deed of company arrangement and a proposed creditors' trust deed. In discussing the creditors' trust deed, Hamilton J observed (at [4]): 
 
 The mechanism proposed by the deed administrator is quite ingenious. It is for the adoption of an amended DCA coupled with a creditors' trust deed. This would remove the sums promised to creditors from the ambit of the DCA to the ambit of a deed of trust. When this is done, the DCA could be discharged; the company would no longer be subject to a DCA; and it is likely that it could be restored to the Stock Exchange board and the contemplated additional capital sums raised, both to feed the promised amounts into a scheme for the creditors and to restore the company to viability. Although this would take the management of the money outside the ambit of the CA, it would be held and supervised in the creditors' interests according to the general law of trusts and their position would be thus protected. Even disputes as to entitlement, if they arose, would have a mechanism for their resolution through the provisions of s 63 of the Trustee Act 1925 .
 

His Honour held in that case that there could be no objection on the ground of legality or propriety to the course that the administrator proposed to follow and gave directions accordingly. The arrangement was, of course, subject to approval by the creditors for its implementation.</text>

<tocase>Re Application of Vouris (2004) 49 ACSR 543</tocase>
<text>34 In support of the application in WAD177 of 2007 it was said that the practical effect of the orders proposed would be that Messrs Rocke and Herbert would be removed in their capacity as liquidators of DUSM. I interpolate that the removal would be affected as a consequence of their tendering their resignations. As Barrett J set out in Re Application of Vouris (2004) 49 ACSR 543 the Act is silent on the effect of the resignation of one of several jointly appointed liquidators in a voluntary winding up. Messrs Read and Birch would fill the vacancies in the office of liquidator arising by reason of the resignations of Messrs Rocke and Herbert. Mr Ashton would be removed in his capacity as liquidator of Keyros and Mr Birch would fill the resulting vacancy. The costs of the application, if the orders sought were made, would be apportioned equally between DUSM and Keyros.

35 It was submitted that pursuant to s 502 of the Act the Court may fill a vacancy in the office of a liquidator where such a vacancy exists. Reference was made to the judgment of Barrett J in Re McGrath and Anor (as liqs of HIH Insurance Ltd (in liq)) (2005) 54 ACSR 55 in which it was held that the Court can make a prospective order appointing a liquidator contingent upon a vacancy being created by the liquidator's resignation. Re Application of Vouris (2004) 49 ACSR 543 was also cited.

40 Reference was made to s 449D of the Act and the decision of Barrett J in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 that the Court can make a prospective order appointing a deed administrator contingent upon a vacancy being created by the resignation of a deed administrator. Reference was made also to s 447A as providing the Court with a very wide power to make such order as it thinks appropriate. Barrett J considered that the powers conferred on the Court by s 447A of the Act were wide enough to give the Court power to appoint a joint and several deed administrator.

41 In relation to the Creditors' Trusts reliance was placed on s 77 of the Trustees Act and s 93 of that Act under which an existing or incumbent trustee could bring to Court an application under s 77.

42 In relation to the resignation of Mr Rocke as a joint and several deed administrator, reference was made to the difficulty identified by Barrett J in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 where a joint and several liquidator resigns or dies leaving only one of the joint and several liquidators remaining. Barrett J, it was said, held that two options were available to the Court in those situations: 
 
 1. Appoint a second liquidator jointly and severally to fill the vacancy; or 
 
 
 
 2. Remove the remaining jointly and severally appointed liquidator and then appoint the previously remaining liquidator as a sole liquidator.

43 It was said that in the case of a deed of administration the difficulties identified in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 would not arise where two or more deed administrators remained jointly and severally appointed. The plaintiffs submitted that Birch and Read remained jointly and severally appointed deed administrators of the companies from which Mr Rocke had offered his resignation so that no vacancy in the office of a joint and several deed administrator arose by reason of that resignation.

44 It was said that the proposed orders both in respect of the deeds of administration and the creditors' trusts would not prejudice creditors. Notification and the liberty to apply would give any objecting creditor an opportunity to approach the Court.

45 Again, it was submitted that pursuant to s 443 of the Act a deed administrator had priority to recover costs and expenses properly incurred from company assets. Section 71 of the Trustees Act provided a trustee with the ability to recover costs and expenses properly incurred from trust assets. The plaintiffs submitted that the costs incurred in bringing the application were properly incurred in the administration of the deeds and the Creditors' Trusts. On that basis the deed administrators and trustees should be indemnified from the assets of the companies for the costs incurred in bringing this application on their behalf. It was submitted that the costs be apportioned equally between the companies.</text>

When the deed of company arrangement terminates, the company ceases to be externally administered, the directors regain full control and it is no longer required to use the endorsement "subject to deed of company arrangement" on its public documents: see s 450E(2) of the Act. The relevant ASIC guideline is entitled 'External administration: Deeds of company arrangement involving a creditors' trust A Guide for registered liquidators appointed under Part 5.3A '.

Creditors' trusts have been helpfully discussed in Heaver-Wren T, "DOCA Termination through Creditors' Trust Deeds" (2004) 12 Insolv LJ 117-120; see also McKenzie R, "Creditors' Trusts and the ASIC Guidelines" (2005) 17(3) Australian Insolvency Journal 4-6; Proudman D, "Some Issues Surrounding Creditors' Trust Deeds Parts 1 and 2 " (2005) 6 INSLB 1-5 and 31-34. The mechanism has been touched on in the Supreme Court decisions: Ian Charles Francis and Michael Patrick Joseph Ryan as Trustees of The West Australian Shed Commercial Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed and West Australian Shed Co Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed [2003] WASC 39 (Pullin J); Open Telecommunications Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2003] NSWSC 1198 (Hamilton J) and Rupert Co v Chameleon Mining (2006) 24 ACLC 635 (Austin J).

51 In Rupert Co 24 ACLC 635, Austin J terminated a winding up of a company under s 482 of the Act having regard to the effect of a deed of company arrangement and creditors' trust which left the company with no significant body of creditors. As a result of those arrangements, it was solvent. The liquidator had advertised for creditors to lodge their claims against the trust. Describing the effect of the deed of company arrangement and the creditors' trust his Honour said (at [18]):
 
 ... the effect of the DOCA and the Creditors' Trust is to transfer the creditors' claims to the Trust and release the company from liability to pay those debts. 
 

He observed that the arrangements appeared to conform to the ASIC guidelines of May 2005 and that ASIC did not oppose the application.

52 The three creditors' trusts affected by the proposed orders are the KPI Creditors' Trust, the Banwell Creditors' Trust and the Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust.

53 The terms of the KPI Creditors' Trust are found in an amended Creditors' Trust Deed which was executed in December 2003 and took effect upon the termination of an amended varied deed of company arrangement executed by the company and the administrators on the execution date. The trust assets comprised the company's assets, a fund and the sum of $10. The fund was to be formed from the proceeds of realisation of the company's assets. Those assets were all of the company's assets or property and all of the assets or property of the KPI Tri Unit Trust and the KPI Trust No 2. Relevantly, cl 6 provided: 
 
 
 6.1 The Trustees shall consider the Claims of each of the Creditors for the purpose of determining the Creditors' Entitlements under this Trust Deed. 
 
 6.2 For the purposes of determining the Entitlements, to the extent that those Entitlements have not been determined under the Amended Varied DOCA, regulations 5.6.39 to 5.6.72 of the Corporations Regulations shall apply to this Trust Deed and to the Trustees as if the reference to the liquidator were references to the Trustees and references to winding up were references to this Trust Deed and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to this Trust Deed. 
 
 6.3 Subdivision A to E of Division 6 of Part 5.6 of the Corporations Act apply to the admission of Claims and payment of Entitlements under this Trust Deed as if the references to winding-up were references to this Trust Deed and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to this Trust Deed.</text>
