<text>8 Counsel for Racing and Wagering submitted that, because the asserted breach of the licence agreement is at its heart referable to copying, that the language in the letters to which I have referred and in particular the passage from the letter of 12 September 2006, which I have set out above, can arguably, reasonably be read as embracing a threat for the purposes of s 202 of the Act . Racing and Wagering referred to the judgment of Mansfield J in Australian Consulting and Training Pty Ltd v Tiltform Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1072. His Honour was there considering amongst other things and relevantly for the purposes of the motion before me, the question of whether a pleading was capable of making out threats of infringement within the meaning of s 128(1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (' Patents Act ' ).</text>
