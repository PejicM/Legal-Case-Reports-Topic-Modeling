<tocase>Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 297 </tocase>
<text>31 The respondents accepted that the making of an order under O 62 r 3 is exceptional. There must be a reason consistent with the dictates of justice to depart from the usual rule: Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 297. In determining whether it would be in the interests of justice to make such an order, regard must be had to at least the following matters. First, whether there has been any fault on the party seeking an order under O 62 r 3. Secondly, whether it would be fair, in all the circumstances, to require a party in whose favour an order for costs has been made in relation to an interlocutory application to await the hearing of the principal proceeding. Thirdly, the conduct of the party against whom the order for costs has been made and, in particular, whether that party has been guilty of delay such as to cause a significant postponement of the final determination of the proceeding. Fourthly, where the costs relate to amendments to pleadings, whether the party against whom the order is sought has also been unable to articulate its claim or its defence in accordance with its obligations under the pleading rules, which has put the opposing party to significant costs. The rule should not be used to punish a party to the litigation. Costs orders are made to compensate, not to punish: Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. See also Ohn v Walton (1995) 36 NSWLR 77 at 79 per Gleeson CJ; Kingscote District Council v Kangaroo Island Eco Action Inc (No 2) (1996) 67 SASR 422 at 426.</text>

<tocase>All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2000] FCA 375 ; (2000) 171 ALR 330</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/375.html</AustLII>
<text>33 In All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2000] FCA 375 ; (2000) 171 ALR 330 , the Court was concerned with a claim under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The applicant had difficulty in particularising the applicant's case and was ordered to pay the respondent's costs thrown away in relation to applications to amend its pleading. The applicant also sought to strike out the respondent's defence.

37 His Honour referred to the dicta of Kiefel J in All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [2000] FCA 375 ; 171 ALR 330 and said at 595:
 [I]t is not the fact of delay which is relevant but its effect upon the proceeding and the position in which the other party is then placed. Here, the respondents have been put to significant expense which, as the costs orders indicate, has been expense which they are entitled to recover from the applicants.

38 In this case it is right, as the respondents contend, that the applicant has taken nearly four years to articulate its statement of claim in its final form (if the fourth further amended statement of claim is its final form) for reasons which are not entirely apparent. A significant problem for the applicant in its pleading has been the applicant's inability to express its claim tightly. From time to time, the looseness of expression by the applicant in its pleading has caused the applicant significant embarrassment.

39 However, the thrust of the applicant's case against the respondents has not significantly changed and the respondents have been on notice since the proceeding was commenced of that claim.

40 The respondents filed their first defence in response to the applicant's statement of claim on 31 October 2005. It filed a further defence on 23 January 2006. The respondents have not been called upon to amend its pleadings whilst the applicant has sought to put its pleading in order. In those circumstances, the respondents have not been put to the considerable costs associated with having to re-plead the matter from time to time.

41 The respondents' costs have been occasioned by needing to have considered the various proposed amendments and the hearings of the applications to amend the statement of claim. They will recover those costs in due course whatever the result of the principal proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Murran Investments Pty Ltd v Aromatic Beauty Products Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1732 ; (2000) 191 ALR 579 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1732.html</AustLII>
<text>36 In Murran Investments Pty Ltd v Aromatic Beauty Products Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1732 ; (2000) 191 ALR 579 , Mansfield J considered an application under this rule. In the proceeding before him, three separate versions of the statement of claim had been struck out and other proposed statements of claim withdrawn. Considerable time had elapsed before a satisfactory version of the statement of claim had been settled upon.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 952</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/952.html</AustLII>
<text>43 There is no evidence that the respondents will suffer any serious disadvantage by not recovering their costs until the principal proceeding is determined. On the other hand, if the order were to be made, both parties would be put to the added expense of considering bills of costs in relation to the separate orders for costs to which reference has already been made. The applicant would need to find funds to pay those costs in advance of the hearing of the principal proceeding. It is desirable that the principal proceeding go forward as soon as possible because the principal proceeding raises important issues which need to be determined. Furthermore, this is not a proceeding where final judgment is "far away" and thus the eventuality of payment is remote: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J and the cases cited therein.

44 On balance, I do not think that this matter calls for an order under O 62 r 3. I think, on balance, the parties would be better served by proceeding with the action rather than being delayed or distracted by the taxation of costs of interlocutory proceedings.

45 There will be no order under O 62 r 3.</text>
