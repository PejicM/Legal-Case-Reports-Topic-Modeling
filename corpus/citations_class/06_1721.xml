<text>This appeal from the making of a sequestration order by Raphael FM ( Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd v Sood (No 2) [2006] FMCA 265) concerns the interplay between the bankruptcy legislation and the Federal proceeds of crime legislation, as did an earlier interlocutory issue ( Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 715). The main question in the appeal is whether an order pursuant to s 18 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) effectively stays execution on an outstanding judgment against the party subject to that order for the purposes of s 40(1)(g) and s 41(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). There is also an issue as to whether the learned Federal Magistrate was in error in making a sequestration order in any event. The facts as to the main question are in a short compass.

On 26 July 2004 the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) obtained orders against Dr Suman Sood (the debtor), the relevant parts of which are as follows: 
 
 
 '1. Pursuant to section 18 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ("the Act "), all the property (within the meaning of "property" as defined in section 338 of the Act ) of Suman Sood ("the Defendant"), including the property described in the First Schedule, but excluding her interest in any business, is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. Pursuant to section 18 of the Act , specified property of another person, namely Suman Medical Pty Limited, being the property described in the Second Schedule is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person.' 
 
 

Property is defined as follows:
 
 'Real or personal property of every description, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere and whether tangible or intangible and includes an interest in any such real or personal property.'

On 10 September 2004, Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd (the creditor) obtained judgment in the Local Court against the debtor in the sum of $59 013.05. On 23 May 2005 a bankruptcy notice was issued by the Official Receiver at the instance of the creditor to the debtor, which notice was served upon the debtor on 24 May 2005. The bankruptcy notice was not complied with on or before 15 June 2005 as required.</text>

<tocase>Director of Public Prosecutions v Sood (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Studdert J, 7 February 2006)</tocase>
<text>Section 24 provides that a court may allow a specified debt incurred in good faith by a person to be met out of property covered by a restraining order but, amongst other conditions, that can only be done if the person whose property is restrained has applied for the order (s 24(1)(d), s 24(2)(a)). The decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to this very order in Director of Public Prosecutions v Sood (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Studdert J, 7 February 2006), establishes that an unsecured creditor has effectively no status to make an application concerning the effect of a s 18 order. No application pursuant to s 24 was made by the debtor prior to the issue and service of the bankruptcy notice.

Concurrently with the enactment of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 , the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2002 (Cth) specifically dealt with the effect of orders pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 upon the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and introduced other amendments to that Act. Section 58A was introduced into the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and modifies the normal operation of s 58(1) that vests property in the Official Trustee or registered trustee as appropriate. Section 58A(1) provides that s 58(1) does not apply to any property of the bankrupt which is covered by a restraining order at the date of the bankruptcy. Section 82(3A) in its current form was also introduced and provides that an amount payable under a proceeds of crime law is not provable in bankruptcy. It was submitted on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (who was permitted to appear as amicus) that a restraining order under the Proceeds of Crime Act has the effect of freezing action under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and prevents property covered by it from being dealt with or distributed under that Act. It is correct that the 2002 amendments give primacy to the proceeds of crime regime over the bankruptcy regime to that extent. However, Parliament did not make any express provision in relation to bankruptcy notices or sequestration orders.

Having considered the authorities in the light of the submissions from counsel in this case, I am left with the feeling that this area of the law needs to be sorted out by the High Court or the legislature. The concept of stay of execution has been stretched beyond recognition. It is difficult to find a basis in the words of the statute for the fine distinctions drawn in the cases. However, in the meantime, I must do the best I can.</text>

<text>I must apply the test laid down by one Full Court in Wiltshire-Smith v Olsson (1995) 57 FCR 572 at 587 and applied by another in Boscolo v Botany Council [1996] FCA 897 whether in the eyes of ordinary fairness in business it will be said that the order has in a business sense prevented the debtor in paying. That test was not overruled in Ling v Enrobook Pty Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 19 , although the approval in that case of the decision of Heerey J in Re Ousley; Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 48 FCR 131 concerning the effect of a Mareeva injunction is of some significance here. I have found the subsequent analysis of that topic by Madgwick J in National Australia Bank Ltd v Pollak (2001) 186 ALR 44 at [41] [52] to be valuable . (See also Taubert v Eddaglide Pty Ltd (in liq) [2001] FCA 567 at [15] [16].) I should add that Mathews J made no reference in Stuart-Jones to the debtor being able to make an application of the kind provided for by s 24 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 under the New South Wales Act considered by her.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Stuart-Jones [2000] FCA 1022 ; (2000) 102 FCR 296 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1022.html</AustLII>
<text>The relevant authorities were considered in this Court by Mathews J in Commissioner of Taxation v Stuart-Jones [2000] FCA 1022 ; (2000) 102 FCR 296 in a similar context. In that case the Supreme Court of New South Wales had made a restraining order under s 10 of the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990 (NSW) against the debtor. A bankruptcy notice was served some time later whilst the order was still in force. In that case the order pursuant to s 10 related only to an identified property and not to the whole of the property of the debtor. Section 10(8) provided as follows: 
 
 'If a restraining order is in force in respect of an interest of a person in property, the restraining order does not prevent: 
 
 
 
 (a) the levying of execution against the property in satisfaction, or partial satisfaction, of the debt arising under a proceeds assessment order in force against the person, or 
 
 (b) with the consent of the Supreme Court, the sale or other disposition of the interest to enable the proceeds to be applied in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt, or 
 
 (c) with the consent of the Supreme Court, the application of the interest in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt.' 
 
 

A 'proceeds assessment order' was an order that the person pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity which took place within the preceding six years. Mathews J indicated that it was at least arguable that a restraining order over the whole of a debtor's property would have the effect of preventing the levying of execution in the relevant sense. However, because of the limited nature of the order in that case, the debtor failed to establish invalidity of the bankruptcy notice.

Before considering the authorities, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 should be examined a little more closely. The relevant provisions are described as 'The confiscation scheme' and are summarised in s 7 of that Act as follows: 
 
 'Chapter 2 sets out 5 processes relating to confiscation: 
 
 
 
 (a) restraining orders prohibiting disposal of or dealing with property (see Part 2-1); and 
 
 (b) forfeiture orders under which property is forfeited to the Commonwealth (see Part 2-2); and 
 
 (c) forfeiture of property to the Commonwealth on conviction of a serious offence (see Part 2-3); and 
 
 (d) pecuniary penalty orders requiring payment of amounts based on benefits derived from committing offences (see Part 2-4); and 
 
 (e) literary proceeds orders requiring payment of amounts based on literary proceeds relating to offences (see Part 2-5).'

It is an offence to breach a restraining order (s 37). It is not clear whether breach of an order would be contempt of court. An order pursuant to s 18 does not appear to catch after acquired property. The Court may order that the Official Trustee take the custody and control of property covered by a restraining order (s 38). The Court may set aside a disposition contravening a restraining order (s 36).

I must apply the test laid down by one Full Court in Wiltshire-Smith v Olsson (1995) 57 FCR 572 at 587 and applied by another in Boscolo v Botany Council [1996] FCA 897 whether in the eyes of ordinary fairness in business it will be said that the order has in a business sense prevented the debtor in paying. That test was not overruled in Ling v Enrobook Pty Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 19 , although the approval in that case of the decision of Heerey J in Re Ousley; Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 48 FCR 131 concerning the effect of a Mareeva injunction is of some significance here. I have found the subsequent analysis of that topic by Madgwick J in National Australia Bank Ltd v Pollak (2001) 186 ALR 44 at [41] [52] to be valuable . (See also Taubert v Eddaglide Pty Ltd (in liq) [2001] FCA 567 at [15] [16].) I should add that Mathews J made no reference in Stuart-Jones to the debtor being able to make an application of the kind provided for by s 24 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 under the New South Wales Act considered by her.</text>
