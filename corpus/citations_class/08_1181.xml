<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688</tocase>

<text>16 In my view, the facts recounted above show that the Commissioner is a person aggrieved by the deregistration of JHAF and has standing to apply for reinstatement of its registration. The public responsibilities of the Commissioner can be compared with those of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which was acknowledged to have standing to apply for a reinstatement under s 601AH in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688.

17 JHAF reduced its capital and paid a dividend in late 2001 and made a second reduction of its capital in 2003. These three transactions, most significantly the first two in 2001, involved a denuding of the company of its assets. The Commissioner wishes to have all three investigated by a liquidator with a view to the possible replenishment of JHAF's coffers to enable it to pay tax.

18 JHAF was incorporated by registration on 17 September 1999. One share in its capital was issued to its parent company upon incorporation and a further 742,611 shares were issued to its parent on 23 February 2000. All 742,612 shares were of $1,000 each and were issued as having been fully paid in cash. The immediate parent company which held all of the shares was JHFBV, to which I referred at [10] above.

80 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 , Austin J addressed the question "When should the Court be satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated?". His Honour said (at [27]), with reference to authorities:
 The wording of the section is very broad, and the cases confirm that it gives the Court a wide discretion. The Court takes into account the circumstances in which the company came to be dissolved; whether, if the order were made, good use could be made of it; and whether any person is likely to be prejudiced by the reinstatement...</text>

<tocase>JP Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 167 FCR 212</tocase>

<text>6 Section 509(5) of the Corporations Act provided that ASIC must deregister a company at the end of a period three months after the liquidator lodges with ASIC a return of the holding of the final meeting. Mr Green filed that return on 23 May 2005. ASIC deregistered JHAF on 23 August 2005. As noted earlier, upon deregistration JHAF ceased to exist. Clearly, Mr Green is no longer in office as its liquidator. It is therefore not quite appropriate to speak of his being "replaced". Although I reached this view before becoming aware of Stone J's decision in JP Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 167 FCR 212 , I note that it is totally in conformity with her Honour's.

7 Section 601AH(5) provides expressly that upon a reinstatement, a person who was a director immediately before the reinstatement "becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company". The existence of this provision suggests, first, that in the absence of such a provision persons in office at the time of deregistration are not automatically reinstated, and, second, that all that is at issue is whether a person should be appointed to an office as from the time of the reinstatement .

8 Mr Green, who has been served, consents to such orders as the Court may make save as to costs, and does not wish to be heard on the application.</text>

<text>14 It has been said that the expression "a person aggrieved by the deregistration" should not be narrowly construed: see Re Proserpine Pty Ltd and the Companies Act [1980] 1 NSWLR 745 at 749 [15]; Pacanowski v Australian Securities Commission (1995) 57 FCR 173 at 175. It does not matter that the person's interest in the decision to deregister arose after the deregistration: Proserpine at 749 [15].</text>

<tocase>Re Steelmaster Pty Ltd (in liq ) (1992) 6 ACSR 494</tocase>
<text>81 At [54], his Honour observed that the reported cases establish that the Court will not make an order which is futile, as where the reinstated company would be left without the funding necessary to permit the liquidator to do any work. His Honour noted that in Re Steelmaster Pty Ltd (in liq ) (1992) 6 ACSR 494, the Court made an order, albeit by consent, for the applicant for reinstatement to pay the costs and disbursements of the liquidator incurred as a result of the reinstatement, including the costs of any further proceedings under s 509 of the Corporations Law.

82 The payments by way of return of capital and interim dividend of November 2001 were made to JHFBV, a corporation that no longer exists. The second return of capital, that of September 2003, was to JHIFBV, a company which, so far as the evidence shows, still exists. The second return of capital, however, was in a sum of only $7,608,773 a small fraction of the amount exceeding $150,000,000 which is expected to be the amount of the tax and shortfall penalties (see [46] above).

83 The Commissioner refers to the fact that the two capital reductions divested JHAF of all of its assets, and that the second of them took place in contemplation of the winding up which was resolved upon the following day. He submits that these steps were taken in the knowledge of the Commissioner's interest in the transactions in which JHAF had previously participated, and that "[t]here is ample room to investigate the validity of those transactions".</text>
