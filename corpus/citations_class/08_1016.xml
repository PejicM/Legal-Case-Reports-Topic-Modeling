<tocase>Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98</tocase>

<text>59 I am satisfied that his conduct has been wilful and contumacious in the sense described in Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the contempt to which he has pleaded guilty was deliberately wilful and contumacious rather than casual, accidental or unintentional.

60 In those circumstances, the only matter left is to determine the appropriate penalty for such a contempt. The District Registrar's counsel took me to the authorities which set out the penalties which may be imposed.

61 This Court has the same power to punish contempts as is possessed by the High Court of Australia in respect of contempts of that Court: s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The High Court of Australia, in turn, has the same power to punish contempts as was possessed in 1903 by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England: s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</text>
