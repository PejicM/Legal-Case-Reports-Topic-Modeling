<text>The Learned Federal Magistrate Wilson's decision and order are biased against the Applicant or Appellant.
 
 
 (emphasis in original) 
 

 Mr Conde has sought orders including that the appeal be allowed, that the decision of the Federal Magistrate be set aside, costs on an indemnity basis and orders with respect to "disciplining of its officers". Orders sought by Mr Hunter
 In his notice of motion currently before me, Mr Hunter has sought the following orders: That the Appellant's Notice of Appeal filed 3 August 2009 be struck out forthwith as an abuse of process and as an appeal which has, on its face, no prospects of success. The Appellant pleads no valid ground of appeal, and each of the Grounds of Appeal 1 to 14 ought to be summarily struck out. The several allegations of unlawful and unprofessional conduct by Anthony James Macklin are vexatious, oppressive and an abuse of process, are wrong, have no proper or pleaded basis in law or fact, and Grounds 8 and 9 ought to be struck out on this basis as well. There is no basis for the allegation of bias pleaded in Ground of Appeal 14; the allegation is wrong in law and fact, is vexatious and oppressive, and is an abuse of process and ought to be struck out on that basis. An order, if necessary and required, that the time and date for the Directions Hearing set out in respect of the Appellant's Notice of Appeal be abridged, and that the date of Tuesday 22 September 2009 be vacated and a time and date for a Directions Hearing be allocated at an earlier time on the grounds of urgency, and on the further grounds that the Notice of Appeal is filed for the purposes of delay only, and is an abuse of process. An order that the Respondent, JOHN LAWRENCE HUNTER be at liberty to file and serve a Creditor's Petition forthwith upon MILTON ARNOLDO CONDE as Judgment Creditor, and further that the hearing and determination of the Creditor's Petition be heard and determined with, after or at the same time as, this Notice of Motion is heard and determined. An order that the Appellant pay the Respondent's costs of and incidental to the appeal on the full indemnity basis, and that such costs be fixed at the hearing of this Notice of Motion. An order that the Appellant be restrained and prevented from instituting any appeal against the dismissal of his appeal in these proceedings without first applying for and obtaining leave of this Honourable Court to bring such an appeal. Such further or other adjournments, enquiries, directions and other orders as to this Honourable Court seem appropriate. Issue 1 what is the nature of the Court's jurisdiction to strike out a notice of appeal pursuant to section 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court Act
 Section 25(2B)(aa) provides that a single judge or the Full Court may give summary judgment in an appellate matter. That a single judge may give judgment summarily dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Court is clear from decisions applying the section: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118.

A question arises whether, in considering s 25(2B)(aa), it is necessary for the Court to also have recourse to s 31A. In a number of cases the Court has exercised power pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) and given summary judgment without reference to s 31A: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 , Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 , Rana v University of Adelaide (No 2) [2008] FCA 941. However in other cases the Court has linked the power under s 25(2B)(aa) to the jurisdiction of the Court under s 31A and summarily dismissed an appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success in prosecuting its grounds of appeal: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118.</text>

<text>The usual rule is that costs follow the event; accordingly the appropriate order is that Mr Conde bear Mr Hunter's costs in respect of this notice of motion. Mr Hunter has sought an order that the costs be awarded on an indemnity basis, however I am not prepared to make an order to that effect. The purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534. A well-known summary of the principles relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion to award indemnity costs can be found in Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 231-234 and InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54 at [11] . Circumstances in which an award of indemnity costs may be warranted include commencement of proceedings where the litigant properly advised should have known there was no chance of success, allegations of fraud by the litigant knowing them to be false, evidence of particular misconduct in the litigant, and where the justice of the case justifies such an order. In this case, while I have found that Mr Conde's grounds of appeal have no arguable basis, it does not automatically follow that he should be liable to Mr Hunter for indemnity costs. The fact that a number of his claims required some consideration, and the absence of any apparent delinquency or extraneous or improper purpose in Mr Conde, in my view warrant an order for party-party costs only.</text>

<tocase>Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/751.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Conde commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court to have the bankruptcy notice set aside and interim orders granting an extension of time for him to comply with the bankruptcy notice. The matter came before Wilson FM, who dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice ( Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751). In his reasons for decision, his Honour found in summary as follows: Mr Conde made no attack on the form of the bankruptcy notice itself. Although Mr Conde contended that Mr Hunter did not have a final judgment or final order (the execution of which had not been stayed in terms of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (" Bankruptcy Act ")) the argument was misconceived. His Honour continued: 
 
 
 A final order is one that disposes finally of an issue between the parties. The concept of what is a final order is discussed in cases such as Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423. In this case, the issue was who should pay the costs of the application to set aside the applicant's pleading. The order made by Judge Searles was a final order, insofar as it concerned that issue. His Honour ordered that the applicant pay the respondent's costs. There is no merit in the first ground sought to be advanced by the applicant. (at [3]) 
 
 

 Notwithstanding Mr Conde's prospective challenge to Orders 3 and 4 of Searles DCJ, it was clear on the material before his Honour that: because the order sought to be challenged on appeal was only as to costs, leave to appeal was required by the Court of Appeal; the application for leave to appeal was filed many months out of time and therefore required an order from the Court of Appeal granting an extension of time. 
The Federal Magistrate noted that no contest had been made against the Orders 1 and 2 made by Searles DCJ, namely to strike out Mr Conde's amended statement of claim and give leave to Mr Conde to replead in that Court. The Federal Magistrate considered that, in those circumstances and having read Mr Conde's application to the Court of Appeal and supporting affidavit, that application to the Court of Appeal has no prospects of success.
 It followed that no good reason was shown for either setting aside the bankruptcy notice or extending time for compliance with it to await the outcome in the Queensland Court of Appeal. Accordingly the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice. Appeal from decision of the Federal Magistrate

While failure of a Court to consider an issue before it and supporting submissions may constitute a miscarriage of justice ( QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd [1996] HCA 1 ; (1996) 134 ALR 433) I can draw no inference that his Honour had regard only to the submissions filed by Mr Hunter and ignored either the substance of Mr Conde's case or the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and rules. It is clear from reviewing the decision of the Federal Magistrate ( Conde v Hunter [2009] FMCA 751) that his Honour:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/230.html</AustLII>
<text>An application for leave to appeal from the order to which a bankruptcy notice relates can constitute "proceedings to set aside a judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued" for the purposes of s 41(6A) and (6C) ( Jenkins v National Australia Bank Ltd [1999] FCA 1758 , Conway v Jackson [2001] FCA 230 ; (2001) 107 FCR 201 at [20] ). However the exercise of the Court's power under s 41(6A) to extend time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is discretionary: Conway v Jackson [2001] FCA 230 ; (2001) 107 FCR 201. In this case the Federal Magistrate refused to grant an order extending time to Mr Conde to comply with the bankruptcy notice. This is because, after consideration of the nature of the prospective application to the Court of Appeal of Queensland, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that Mr Conde had no prospects of success in relation to either his application for an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal from the orders of Searles DCJ, or the actual application for leave to appeal. As is well known from the decision of the High Court in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 in respect of appeals against the exercise of judicial discretion: 
 
 It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is reasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. (at 504-505)</text>

It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is reasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. (at 504-505)

In neither his notice of appeal nor his submissions has Mr Conde disputed his Honour's conclusions with respect to Mr Conde's prospects of success in his applications to the Court of Appeal of Queensland. It is clear that his Honour considered whether he should make an order extending time for Mr Conde to comply with the bankruptcy notice, and concluded that an application for an extension of time was unmerited in the circumstances. In light of the principles articulated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 I am unable to find that his Honour failed to properly exercise the discretion vested in him by s 41(6A).

Section 41(6C) was of no apparent relevance in relation to Mr Conde's application before his Honour.

In my view Mr Conde's grounds of appeal with respect to s 41(6A) and (6C) have no merit. Ground 9: Alleged conduct of Mr Hunter's solicitor

Mr Conde's allegations as found in ground 9 of his notice of appeal are not supported by any evidence. In my view they are scandalous and vexatious as claimed by Mr Hunter. I also do not see the relevance of the allegations to the question whether the bankruptcy notice served on Mr Conde should be set aside.

In my view this ground of appeal has no merit. Ground 10: The bankruptcy notice prejudices or delays the fair trial or proceedings in the State Courts</text>

<text>The usual rule is that costs follow the event; accordingly the appropriate order is that Mr Conde bear Mr Hunter's costs in respect of this notice of motion. Mr Hunter has sought an order that the costs be awarded on an indemnity basis, however I am not prepared to make an order to that effect.

In this case, while I have found that Mr Conde's grounds of appeal have no arguable basis, it does not automatically follow that he should be liable to Mr Hunter for indemnity costs. The fact that a number of his claims required some consideration, and the absence of any apparent delinquency or extraneous or improper purpose in Mr Conde, in my view warrant an order for party-party costs only.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1758.html</AustLII>
<text>An application for leave to appeal from the order to which a bankruptcy notice relates can constitute "proceedings to set aside a judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued" for the purposes of s 41(6A) and (6C) ( Jenkins v National Australia Bank Ltd [1999] FCA 1758 , Conway v Jackson [2001] FCA 230 ; (2001) 107 FCR 201 at [20] ). However the exercise of the Court's power under s 41(6A) to extend time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is discretionary: Conway v Jackson [2001] FCA 230 ; (2001) 107 FCR 201. In this case the Federal Magistrate refused to grant an order extending time to Mr Conde to comply with the bankruptcy notice. This is because, after consideration of the nature of the prospective application to the Court of Appeal of Queensland, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that Mr Conde had no prospects of success in relation to either his application for an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal from the orders of Searles DCJ, or the actual application for leave to appeal. As is well known from the decision of the High Court in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 in respect of appeals against the exercise of judicial discretion:

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1724.html</AustLII>
<text>In this case however Mr Hunter has sought an order striking out Mr Conde's notice of appeal. As a general proposition the Court may strike out a notice of appeal if the notice does not disclose any arguable basis for granting the appeal: cf Patten v New Holland Credit Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1724. Such an order is clearly by way of summary judgment. In my view the jurisdiction of the Court under s 25(2B)(aa) contemplates an order striking out a notice of appeal.

At the hearing before me Mr Macklin on behalf of Mr Hunter stated that he also relied on s 31A of the Federal Court Act. Section 31A provides that the Court may give judgment if, inter alia , the Court is satisfied that a party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding (s 31A(2)(b)). For the purposes of that section, a proceeding need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success: s 31A(3).</text>

<tocase>Re a Debtor (No 5982 of 1979) (1981) 78 Law Society Gazette Reports 631</tocase>
<text>A helpful comparison may be drawn between the facts of the case before me, and those in an English case Re a Debtor (No 5982 of 1979) (1981) 78 Law Society Gazette Reports 631 (Brightman and O'Connor LJJ and Fox J, 30 January 1981). In Re a Debtor bankruptcy notices issued by petitioning creditors were based, inter alia , on orders for costs granted to them following successful summonses to strike out an application brought against them by the debtor. Certificates had been issued by the taxing officer in respect of the costs awarded. Brightman LJ, with whom O'Connor LJ and Fox J agreed, said that: 
 
 the principal issue was whether the orders for costs read with the taxing officer's certificates were final orders at the date of issue of the bankruptcy notices. The debtor started with the proposition that the order striking out his cause of action was interlocutory for the purposes of s.31 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 . But it did not follow, as the debtor contended, that the orders for costs contained in the master's order and the judge's order must also be interlocutory. In his Lordship's view, in each case the order for taxation and payment of costs read with the taxing officer's certificate was a final order. (at 631)

In this case the costs order made by Searles DCJ was clearly a final order for the purposes of s 40(1)(g). It follows that there was no error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate in respect of this finding, and accordingly there is no merit in Mr Conde's grounds of appeal in respect of this issue. Ground 2: The Federal Magistrate failed to identify the relevant legislation on which he relied to dismiss Mr Conde's application

In my view this ground of appeal has no merit. In his judgment the Federal Magistrate specifically referred to the Bankruptcy Act and s 40(1)(g) upon which his Honour relied. His Honour's reasons for dismissing Mr Conde's application were clear, and identified relevant principles. Grounds 3, 4: The Federal Magistrate took into account only Mr Hunter's submissions, and failed to take into consideration Mr Conde's application and affidavit or the relevant legislation

Second, as was observed in Re a Debtor (No 5982 of 1979) at 631 the mere fact that an order is subject to a pending appeal is not a reason for treating it as other than a final order and did not prevent the issue of a bankruptcy notice.

Third, the Bankruptcy Act allows a petitioning creditor to apply for the issue of a bankruptcy notice based on a final judgment or final order. As I have already observed, it is clear on the material before the Court that the bankruptcy notice served on Mr Conde was founded on a final order of the District Court of Queensland, and properly issued. The fact that there may be related proceedings in other Courts does not prevent the proper issue of a bankruptcy notice and steps taken in pursuance of that notice. Ground 13: Whether there were clear errors of law in the proceedings that could have materially affected his Honour's decision

I agree with Mr Hunter that ground 13 is vague and non-specific. In my view it has no merit. Ground 14: The Federal Magistrate was biased against Mr Conde

Mr Conde submitted that the Federal Magistrate was not open-minded in hearing the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, and was biased.</text>

This is particularly so where the Court's findings were open on the material before it: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 519 and 531-532.</text>

<text>A question arises whether, in considering s 25(2B)(aa), it is necessary for the Court to also have recourse to s 31A. In a number of cases the Court has exercised power pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) and given summary judgment without reference to s 31A: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 , Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 , Rana v University of Adelaide (No 2) [2008] FCA 941. However in other cases the Court has linked the power under s 25(2B)(aa) to the jurisdiction of the Court under s 31A and summarily dismissed an appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success in prosecuting its grounds of appeal: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118.</text>
