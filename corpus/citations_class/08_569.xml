<tocase>Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/94.html</AustLII>
<text>7 In Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94 , Jacobson J at paras 16 through to and including 18 remarked as follows:
 
 
 16. It was until recently well settled that there was no presumption upon default of the respondent of the correctness of the applicant's claims: see Commissioner of Taxation v Finn [1960] HCA 69 ; (1960) 103 CLR 165. 
 17. It was not open to the court to make an order for default judgment except on the bringing of a motion supported by evidence as to the merits of the application: see Australian Securities Commission v McLeod (1994) 54 FCR 309 per Drummond J; see also for example Grey v Mango Prepaid Calling Cards Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1664 per Nicholson J, and Zomba Production Music v Roadhouse Productions (2001) 190 ALR 288 per Stone J. 
 18. However, recent authorities indicate that the introduction of Order 35A provides the foundation for a finding that in the absence of a defence where there is a pleading by way of a statement of claim then the facts in the statement of claim are admitted.</text>

<tocase>Roussel Uclaf v Pan Laboratories Proprietary Limited [1994] FCA 1176 ; (1994) 29 IPR 556</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1994/1176.html</AustLII>
<text>21 Trite though it may be, I note that s 154 of the Act confers jurisdiction upon this court with respect to matters arising under the Act . The Act does not contain a section which expressly empowers the court to order the delivery up of infringing products. This particular feature of the Act , in contradistinction to s 116 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), was noted by Einfeld J in Roussel Uclaf v Pan Laboratories Proprietary Limited [1994] FCA 1176 ; (1994) 29 IPR 556.

22 His Honour further noted, however, that this court has general power to make an order for delivery up of that kind in accordance with established principles of equitable relief pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That section provides that the court has power in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, and to issue, or direct the issue of, writs of such kinds as the court thinks appropriate. I note, further, s 5(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , which provides for this Court to be a superior court of record and a court of law and equity.

23 I am quite satisfied, having regard to ss 5 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , that I have power to make order 2 of the orders sought. Power to make order 3 is derived, in my opinion, from a combination of s 122(1) of the Act and ss 5 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . Orders 4 and 5, as described earlier, are ancillary, and power to make them is to be found, in my opinion, in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .

24 Some further comment should be made in respect of the form in which the restraint proposed is cast. In Atkins Court Forms , Second Edition, Volume 30, 1979 issue, page 192, paragraph 67, the learned authors of that English text state as follows: 
 Account of Profits The plaintiff in an infringement action is entitled, at his option, to an account of profits in lieu of damages. Where there is a consent or default order, there having been no full court hearing with consequent guidance as to what constitutes an infringement, the orders should be narrowly framed.</text>

<tocase>Walker v Wilson Doors (Sales and Contracts) Limited (1964) RPC 246</tocase>
<text>25 The position in Australia in respect of an Applicant in an infringement application being entitled by election to an account of profits in lieu of damages is no different. In respect of the last sentence in the passage quoted, the learned authors cite Walker v Wilson Doors (Sales and Contracts) Limited (1964) RPC 246. Regard to that case discloses that it reports an exchange between Lloyd-Jacob J and counsel in relation to the form of a restraint order. His Lordship was concerned in the making of an order that the restraint not be cast overly widely. The restraint that had been proposed, albeit by consent, was one whereby the defendants would be restrained, whether by their directors, officers, servants or agents, or any of them or otherwise howsoever from infringing the plaintiff's letters patent numbered.

26 His Lordship remarked, at page 247:
 I am aware that this has been a common form of order in the past. In fact, I know because bitter experience has taught us, that it might well result in a dispute between the parties that has to be fought in contempt proceedings and might easily arise where parties have really got a genuine difference as to what is and what is not within the scope of the patent.

27 I am conscious that this is a default proceeding. It seems to me that the form of order which is proposed in this instance does not suffer from the vice of generality of the kind which occasioned concern to Lloyd-Jacob J.

28 It may prove to be the case that upon the filing of the affidavit of the kind described in para 4 of the proposed orders that more detailed direction is needed in respect of the taking of accounts. It seems to me, therefore, that it is appropriate to adjourn the substantive application to a date to be fixed, as well as adjourn the notice of motion to a date to be fixed, and to grant to the parties liberty to apply, both particularly in respect of or in relation to the taking of an account and otherwise generally in relation to the further conduct of the proceeding.

29 At the request of counsel for the Applicants, I shall in the formal orders add the words "in Australia" after "setting" in paragraph 1 and "predicts" in paragraph 2.


 I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
