<tocase>Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakay Native Title Claim Group v Northern Territory of Australia (2004) 207 ALR 539</tocase>
<text>176 It is tolerably clear that s 59 determines rights and obligations in the Northern Territory under Northern Territory law (whether the common law or statute) between a licensee under the Act who has constructed or operates a pipeline and the owners or lessees of property through which the pipeline passes. The provision is intended to ensure that the balance of rights and obligations would not be determined on the basis that the pipeline was a fixture. However, the relevant legal question, for present purposes, is whether the pipelines were "fixture(s)" as that expression appears in s 253 of the NTA. The character of the pipelines, for that purpose, cannot be determined by Northern Territory legislation. Indeed, I am bound to follow the conclusion of Mansfield J in Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakay Native Title Claim Group v Northern Territory of Australia (2004) 207 ALR 539 (at [307]) that the word "fixture" in the definition means a fixture as understood at common law, unless I thought his Honour was plainly wrong, which I do not.</text>

<tocase>Australian Provincial Assurance Co Ltd v Coroneo (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 700</tocase>
<text>177 At common law, as Mansfield J noted, a fixture requires a degree of annexation to the land, and an intention that it be permanent: see generally Australian Provincial Assurance Co Ltd v Coroneo (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 700 at 712-713. The applicants appeared to make a submission that the pipelines were not fixtures, apart from s 59 of the Energy Pipelines Act, having regard to the observations of the majority of the High Court in Commissioner of Main Roads v North Shore Gas Co Ltd [1967] HCA 41 ; (1967) 120 CLR 118 at 127. For my part, I do not view those observations as warranting the conclusion that the pipelines in the present case were not fixtures at common law. Their Honours said that the presumption that whatever is fixed to freehold land is said to become part of it is rebuttable and, in effect, could be rebutted where a statute had empowered someone other than the owner of land to affix to or embed things in the soil and yet retain ownership of those things. Their Honours were addressing what the legal consequences might be of something being a fixture in a particular context, not what was a fixture. In the present case there is little room to doubt that the pipelines are fixtures. They were embedded in the soil and, for all practical purposes, were to remain there permanently. I conclude that they are fixtures. It is unnecessary to determine whether they are also major earthworks.</text>

<tocase>Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 ; (2007) 157 FCR 121</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/3.html</AustLII>
<text>164 In the draft determination appended to the Full Court's reasons for decision (a draft proposed by the State of South Australia), the formulation concerning adjacent areas as "the exclusive use of which is necessary for the enjoyment...". This is the formulation in the determination ultimately made by the Full Court. In this matter, as mentioned earlier, the Pastoralists advocated the adoption of the formulation in the reasons. The applicants advocated the adoption of the formulation in the determination. For my part, I doubt that there is a material difference between the formulation in the reasons and the formulation in the determination (except, perhaps, whether one speaks of "use" or "exclusive use" (in the determination)). If something is reasonably necessary, it is necessary. I apprehend that the word "necessary", like the word "unique", gains little by qualification. If anything, the qualifying word "reasonably" might be viewed as a word of limitation (potentially to the Pastoralists' detriment): see Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 ; (2007) 157 FCR 121 (at [107]-[109]). Similarly, if adjacent land is required because its use is incidental to the operation or enjoyment of the improvement, then it can reasonably be said that its use is necessary for the operation or enjoyment of the improvement. In any event, the formulation in the reasons of the Full Court had its origins in the reasons of the majority of the High Court in Ward HC (at [308]) in which only the word "necessary" is used, albeit to ancillary rights for the meaningful exercise of a granted right and not the use of areas of land.

165 While the test propounded by the Full Court in its reasons in De Rose (No 2) did not speak of "exclusive use", the determination did. It can be assumed that the determination of the Full Court truly reflects the Court's intentions. Accordingly, it is appropriate to adopt the formulation used in the determination in De Rose (No 2) .

166 I turn to consider whether, and to what extent, the determination should specify the area of adjoining land on which native title rights have been extinguished at least in relation to improvements about which there was some evidence. In their written submissions, the Pastoralists proposed a buffer zone of 2 kilometres around the homestead areas, a buffer zone of 1 kilometre around buildings used for the purpose of accommodating the "stock camp" on Newcastle Waters station, 500 metres for airstrips, 1 kilometre for constructed watering points, 2 kilometres for stockyards and 1 kilometre from trap yards. Other than in the case of the buffer zone around the homestead complex these distances were identified in the evidence of Mr Warriner in relation to the improvements on Newcastle Waters station.</text>

<tocase>Citizens Airport Environment Association Inc v Maritime Services Board (1993) 30 NSWLR 207</tocase>
<text>185 Reference was made to the judgment of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Citizens Airport Environment Association Inc v Maritime Services Board (1993) 30 NSWLR 207. In issue in that case was whether the Federal Airports Corporation was dredging sand "on behalf of" the Maritime Services Board. The Court was divided on whether the dredging was being done "on behalf of" the Board, but that division of opinion turned, in part, on how the various members of the Court viewed the facts. There appeared to be general acceptance that it was necessary for there to be some measure of control by the Board over the dredging to be able to say that the activity was undertaken on its behalf. This authority is of limited assistance particularly given that in the present case there was effectively no evidence concerning whether NTEC exercised any control over the construction of the pipelines, and if so what the nature of the control was. I am not satisfied the main pipeline (or the lateral line) is a "public work" as defined and accordingly its construction was not a previous exclusive possession act extinguishing native title.

186 Alternative submissions were made by NT Gas, namely that the grant of the two pipeline licences engaged s 44H of the NTA and activity done in furtherance of those licences prevailed over any native title rights and interests of the applicants. Reference was also made to the easements but it was accepted by NT Gas that they had no greater extinguishing effect than that flowing from the grant of the pastoral leases. These matters were not addressed in any substantial way in the written submissions nor developed orally. The applicants' draft determination recognises NT Gas's interests deriving from the licences and easements. I do not apprehend that it is presently necessary for me to determine any further issues raised by NT Gas, having dealt with the question of whether the pipelines were public works.

187 This leads to a consideration of the second matter, areas adjacent to public works. Section 23B(7) of the NTA includes as previous exclusive possession acts the construction or establishment of any public work that commenced to be constructed or established on or before 23 December 1996. Section 251D of the Act provides that a reference to land or waters on which a public work is constructed, established or situated includes a reference to "any adjacent land or waters the use of which is or was necessary for, or incidental to, the construction, establishment or operation of the work". The Northern Territory contended that a number of areas of land were adjacent land for the purpose of s 251D of the Act. The adjacent areas of land which the Northern Territory contended fell with s 251D of the Act which are in issue relate to:
 
 (a) a road reserve for the Newcastle Waters road;
 (b) gravel pits servicing the Stuart and Buchanan Highways;
 (c) water catchment and storage dams servicing the Buchanan Highway; and
 (d) a buffer zone around Bore RN23745.</text>

<tocase>Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/666.html</AustLII>
<text>83 The Northern Territory submitted that the evidence established a position the same as in Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 (" Daniel ") where Nicholson J concluded that there was no right to build houses but that there was a right to built shelters including bough sheds, mias and humpies.

84 The applicants contended that the issue appeared not to be whether there was a right to live on the land but how this right could be exercised, in particular whether the right may be exercised permanently at a particular place on the land, and whether it may be exercised by erecting permanent shelters and structures. The applicants also noted that the wording of the claimed right did not make any reference to living or camping permanently at a particular place or to the erection of permanent structures.

85 Two issues arise for consideration. The first is whether the evidence established the existence of the claimed right or of a right with similar but different characteristics. The second is whether the claimed right had been extinguished by the grant of the pastoral leases. As to this second issue, I view myself as bound by the decision of the Full Court in Alyawarr to conclude that the grant of the pastoral leases in the present matter did not extinguish any native title right to live or camp on the leasehold land. That the present case involved subsisting leases is not, for reasons submitted by the applicants, a relevant point of distinction.

86 As to whether the claimed right exists, it is necessary to review the evidence. Generally, the Aboriginal witnesses who gave evidence on country were asked preliminary questions in evidence in chief about their mangaya country, the meaning of "mangaya", and what rights it entailed in the land. Each witness confirmed that they had a right to live on their mangaya country. For example, Shannon Dixon gave evidence, when asked what it meant to be mangaya or an owner for country, that it meant "I can go stay and live there". A number of witnesses were specifically asked if anyone had the right, under traditional law, to stop them staying or living in their mangaya country, and these witnesses confirmed that no one had such a right. Evidence was, however, given by Janey Dixon that if she caused serious trouble then members of her family could kick her out of her mother's country (Marlinja) or father's country (Narlwan).

87 Some witnesses also gave evidence about their rights in their mother's country. Janey Dixon, for example, lives in Marlinja, which is her mother's country. Her evidence was that she has the right to live in Marlinja, permanently, and that no one could stop her from living there, under traditional law, and that she was kurdungurlu or kulyungkulyungpi for that country, which she described as being "like a black policeman".

88 A number of witnesses also gave evidence that their children and grandchildren also had rights in their country, through them. For example, William Kingston gave evidence that his mangaya country, Longreach, is also his daughter's mangaya country. Janey Dixon's evidence was that her daughter and her brother's children had rights in Marlinja, her mother's country, including the right to stay there. A number of witnesses also gave evidence about the rights of their spouse or children who also had rights in that country and the nature of those rights. The pattern was that spouses also had rights to live on the country but under traditional law, were expected to ask permission to do certain things, although the evidence was also that the spouse knew where he or she could and could not go and who they should ask.

89 Evidence of a similar kind was given in statements by the three witnesses who were not required for cross-examination. None of the evidence about the right to live was challenged in a material way in cross-examination.

111 The applicants submitted that the Regulations did not contain any restriction on the use of a garbage depot. They merely provided an ability for members of the public to use land for the disposal of garbage, at the direction of an executive officer. The applicants contended that the effect of the reservation and approval for use as a garbage depot could not be considered wholly inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights: see Daniel (at [693] regarding access to a cemetery reserve). Further, it was submitted that the approval could not be said with any certainty to have affected native title to any extent greater than that caused by the earlier grant of historical pastoral leases.

112 The Northern Territory and the Pastoralists submitted that between 1965 and 1980 the entirety of NT Portion 797 was used for the disposal of garbage. The applicants accepted that the land was in fact used for disposal of garbage for the period, although they noted that such use of the land was unlawful until the land was approved as a depot for the deposit of garbage in 1971. Aerial photographs of the area in 1980 and 2003 were in evidence. The applicants submitted, in the event that it was necessary to consider the evidence about use of the reserve, that the aerial photographs did not show which part or parts of NT Portion 797 were used for the disposal of garbage. It was submitted that it should not be inferred that all the land was used, particularly since it was a large area (44 hectares). The applicants' position was therefore that in the absence of evidence about the area used, it was not possible to conclude that native title rights were extinguished to any extent in any part of the reserve.

113 The Northern Territory submitted that the use of land for the disposal of garbage on land which was reserved as a garbage reserve and declared as a garbage depot demonstrated the assertion of rights by the Crown, and the creation of rights in third parties, which were wholly inconsistent with the continued existence and enjoyment of any native title rights in relation to the whole of the area covered.

235 The Northern Territory submitted the proclamation of a new town, and the setting aside of Crown land within the town's boundaries as town lands, had been the first step in the process for the conferral of interests on members of the public permitting them to establish residences and businesses. The Northern Territory referred to Daniel , in which Nicholson J held that s 47B of the NTA had no application to the Karratha townsite area, which had been declared a townsite by the Governor. His Honour held (at [970]) that the Governor was "the Crown in any capacity", that defining and setting apart the boundaries of the townsite as town and suburban lands constituted a proclamation or declaration, and that a townsite is both a public purpose and particular purpose.

238 In my opinion, the basis for distinguishing Alyawarr advanced by the Northern Territory fails to recognise that the Full Court expressly rejected the notion that the expression "is to be used" raises for consideration what in fact happened after the proclamation. Whether the land "is to be used" for a prescribed purpose, was to be gleaned from the proclamation and constating legislation. Those instruments provided an objective basis for determining the question (at [188]). As to the judgment of Nicholson J in Daniel , it was handed down on 3 July 2003, some two years before Alyawarr was decided on 29 July 2005. Moreover, Nicholson J's comments relied on by the Northern Territory, were also described as dicta by Weinberg J in the Timber Creek Case . The reasoning of Weinberg J is apt to apply in the present matter and the proclamation of the township has not excluded the beneficial operation of s 47B.

239 Section 26(1)(a) of the Heritage Conservation Act confers a power on the Minister, upon receiving a recommendation of the Heritage Advisory Council, to: 
 
 by notice in the Gazette, declare the place (or part of the place) or object to which the recommendation relates, to be a heritage place or heritage object or, in the case of an object associated with a heritage place but which is not itself declared to be a heritage object, to be part of the Northern Territory heritage

240 On 11 November 1993, the area within the town of Newcastle Waters was declared a heritage place pursuant to s 26(1)(a) of the Heritage Conservation Act. The declaration provided:
 
 I, BARRY FRANCIS COULTER, the Minister for Conservation, in pursuant of section 26(1)(a) of the Heritage Conservation Act on the recommendation of the Heritage Advisory Council and within the time specified in the section, declare the area specified in the Schedule, known as Newcastle Waters Township, to be a heritage place.</text>

<tocase>De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/110.html</AustLII>
<text>82 The Northern Territory and the Pastoralists contended that the Full Court's decision ought not be followed, for two reasons. Firstly, it was said that the pastoral leases in Alyawarr were not current leases under which pastoral activities were occurring, and secondly, the decision of the Full Court was attended by error. The applicants submitted that the contention that the Full Court had erred could not be maintained because the decision was binding authority. Further, they submitted that Alyawarr could not be distinguished on the basis advanced by the Northern Territory because the relevant inquiry was about inconsistency of rights, not activity. Further, in Alyawarr (at [218]-[227]), the same arguments about a right to live on land were advanced in relation to a current Crown lease, and were rejected. The Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (" De Rose (No 2) ") had also recognised a similarly worded right in relation to lands which had been continuously subject to pastoral leases for over 60 years and remained so at the time of trial and determination. The applicants also submitted that the qualification proposed by the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists suggested a right on the part of the lessee to exclude the native title holders should they remain on the land any longer than "temporarily", which was contrary to the principle that pastoral leases did not confer a right to exclude native title holders from the land established in Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1 (" Wik ") at 120-121, 146-147, 154-155, 190-195, and Ward HC (at [179]-[186] and [417]).</text>

<tocase>De Rose v South Australia [2002] FCA 1342</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1342.html</AustLII>
<text>158 The following observations were made by the trial judge concerning airstrips and roads in De Rose v South Australia [2002] FCA 1342 (at [558]), the proceedings culminating in De Rose (No 2) :
 
 ...I do not see how improvements such as fences and roads would wholly, or even partially, extinguish native title; they are clear examples of improvements which are capable of joint use. Airstrips represent a particular problem because of issues of safety. Because of that factor, I would deny the claimants all rights of access with a buffer zone of 500 metres. In respect of airstrips and their buffer zones, native title has been extinguished.

159 This reasoning must, of course, be tested against the approach determined by the Full Court in the appeal from that judgment. It is doubtless true that many of the native title rights arising in this matter (except, perhaps, the right to live and camp including to erect shelters) can be exercised on land on which an airstrip or road has been constructed. While it is possible that the exercise of those rights might conflict with the use of an airstrip or road (for example, hunting on the airstrip or road when a plane is landing or vehicle passing by), it could reasonably be expected that such circumstances would be rare. However, as I apprehend the reasons of the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) , based, as they were, on High Court authority, it is important to focus ultimately on the competing and potentially inconsistent rights of pastoralists (and their exercise) and native title right holders and not merely on whether land can be used simultaneously by both in exercise of those rights.

160 If I was satisfied on the evidence that the trap yard airstrips and pastoral roads were constructed, in the sense discussed by the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) , in exercise of rights conferred by the leases, then it would appear to follow from the reasons of the Full Court, that their construction in exercise of those rights probably extinguished all native title rights on the land on which they were constructed. However, the evidence to which I was referred does not enable me to conclude that there was such construction. If it be the fact (and this is not established one way or the other by this evidence) that the trap yard airstrips were nothing more than naturally flat land cleared of vegetation and the roads were nothing more than navigable land over which vehicles have continuously driven, then probably neither could be said to have been constructed. If it be the fact (and this is not established one way or the other by this evidence) that either the trap yard airstrips or the pastoral roads (or some of them) had been graded and formed then it may be possible to say they have been constructed in exercise of rights conferred by the lease. Given the paucity of the evidence I am unable to conclude that native title rights have been extinguished on land on which trap yard airstrips and pastoral roads presently exist on the claim area.

161 The next issue concerns land adjacent to the improvements. The applicants conceded that where native title had been extinguished on land due to the construction of an improvement on that land, native title would also be extinguished on adjacent land, the exclusive use of which was necessary for the enjoyment of the improvement. The applicants proposed a regime, to be incorporated in the determination, which involved identifying the land adjacent to improvements in general terms and the creation of a liberty to apply: 
 
 to establish the precise location of the boundaries of land on which the improvements referred to at Schedule D to this determination have been constructed and any adjacent land or waters the exclusive use of which is necessary for the enjoyment of the improvements.

162 The Pastoralists contended that such an order should be expressed consistently with [166] of De Rose (No 2) , not by reference to "exclusive use", and similarly, that the reference to the buffer zone or adjacent areas in the determination should be expressed in the same way. Where the evidence permitted a finding about the adjacent area needed to permit enjoyment of the improvement, the Pastoralists submitted that that should be reflected in the determination though they appeared to accept that, as an alternative, findings could be made in the reasons for judgment identifying the adjacent area in relation to those improvements addressed by the evidence.</text>

<text>146 The Pastoralists submitted that the rights granted by a pastoral lease included the right to construct roads, tracks, laneways, mustering routes and like improvements. Since a pastoralist could establish a right of way, it was submitted that the pastoralist must have a right to use it at will. The right to exercise a right of way meant that native title rights could not co-exist with such rights, as both rights could not be exercised at the same time. The Pastoralists referred by analogy to Fourmile v Selpam Pty Ltd (1998) 80 FCR 151.</text>

<tocase>Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/903.html</AustLII>
<text>236 The applicants submitted that there was no basis for distinguishing Alyawarr and that it was binding on this Court. The applicants referred also to the decision of Weinberg J in Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903 (" Timber Creek Case "), in which his Honour had regarded himself as bound by the Full Court's conclusion in Alyawarr in relation to the issue of whether the proclamation of Timber Creek as a town disengaged s 47B. Timber Creek, like the town of Newcastle Waters, was a working town and not a paper town like Hatches Creek, the town concerned in Alyawarr . In the Timber Creek Case , Weinberg J said (at [677] [678]):
 
 The factual matrix under which s 47B must be considered in the present case differs somewhat from that which applied in Alyawarr . The proclamation constituting and defining the boundaries of Timber Creek, and setting aside Crown lands within the town boundaries so declared as town lands, was dated 10 May 1975. It was made under s 111 of the Ordinance, the same provision that authorised the proclamation of Hatches Creek. The Timber Creek proclamation was published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette on 10 June 1975. 
 
 As the Full Court noted in Alyawarr, judges at first instance have differed on the application of s 47B to areas within the boundaries of towns constituted by proclamation. In Hayes , Olney J was content to apply the section to unalienated and unreserved Crown land in the town of Alice Springs. In Daniel, however, RD Nicholson J observed that the section would not apply to the town site of Karratha because the proclamation of a site for a town would involve "a public purpose", as well as "a particular purpose". However, because there was no claim to the town site in Daniel (which was, in any event, covered by a reserve) his Honour's comments regarding s 47B were dicta.

237 His Honour continued (at [699] to [700]):
 
 Counsel for the Northern Territory did not have the benefit of the considered views of the Full Court in Alyawarr at the time these submissions were made. Plainly, they are at odds with the reasoning of the Full Court. As previously mentioned, Alyawarr was the subject of an unsuccessful application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. Hayne J described the reasoning of the Full Court as 'not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of special leave to appeal to this Court'. 
 
 I am of course bound by the decision of the Full Court in Alyawarr. As I was a member of that Full Court, it is hardly surprising that I regard the decision as correct. To the extent that Daniel reflects a different approach to the construction of s 47B, I must respectfully decline to follow that decision. It follows that s 47B(1)(b)(ii) is no impediment to the operation of s 47B in these proceedings.</text>

<text>22 The claimed right in [21](k) is no longer pressed by the applicants, in light of observations made by the Full Court in Gumana v Northern Territory [2007] FCAFC 23 (at [164]-[172]), a judgment given after final submissions were made in these matters.

23 The applicants contended that the neighbouring estate groups and the spouses of the estate group members held native title rights and interests as follows:
 
(a) the right to travel over, to move about and to have access to the non-exclusive areas;
 
(b) the right to hunt and to fish on the land and waters of the non-exclusive areas;
 
(c) the right to gather and to use the natural resources of the non-exclusive areas such as food, medicinal plants, wild tobacco, timber, stone and resin;
 
(d) the right to take and to use the natural water resources on the non-exclusive areas;
 
(e) the right to camp on the non-exclusive areas;
 
(f) the right to light fires on the non-exclusive areas for domestic purposes;
 
 (g) the right to conduct activities necessary to give effect to the rights referred to in (a) to (f) hereof.

24 The rights described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of [21] concerning the neighbouring estate group members are the same as the rights identified in the corresponding paragraphs in [23] regarding the estate group members.</text>

<tocase>Jango v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/318.html</AustLII>
<text>92 Both the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists submitted that the right should not be expressed as involving or comprehending a "right to live". But that is precisely what the evidence established, the acknowledgement and observance of that right. It must be remembered, as Sackville J observed in Jango v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150 (" Jango ") (at [407]), Aboriginal witnesses cannot be expected to recount their laws and customs with anything like the precision that might reasonably be expected of a lawyer expounding common law principles. It is true that the evidence did not establish a present widespread observance of the right to live being exercised in the form of building structures in which to permanently reside. However, that does not compel the conclusion that the claimants did not presently possess that right in the relevant statutory sense. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (at [84]): 
 
 [E]vidence that at some time, since sovereignty, some of those who now assert that they have that native title have not exercised those rights, or evidence that some of those through whom those now claiming native title rights or interests contend to be entitled to them have not exercised those rights or interests, does not inevitably answer the relevant statutory questions. 

 That is so, because the critical question concerns possession of the rights and interests and not their exercise.</text>

<text>92 Both the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists submitted that the right should not be expressed as involving or comprehending a "right to live". But that is precisely what the evidence established, the acknowledgement and observance of that right. It must be remembered, as Sackville J observed in Jango v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150 (" Jango ") (at [407]), Aboriginal witnesses cannot be expected to recount their laws and customs with anything like the precision that might reasonably be expected of a lawyer expounding common law principles. It is true that the evidence did not establish a present widespread observance of the right to live being exercised in the form of building structures in which to permanently reside. However, that does not compel the conclusion that the claimants did not presently possess that right in the relevant statutory sense. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (at [84]):

<text>214 In relation to the gravel pits, the applicants' position was that none of the existing gravel, the access tracks, nor the additional areas, were adjacent to the relevant public work, being the Stuart Highway or Buchanan Highway. It is convenient to commence by considering what is meant by "adjacent" in s 251D. This issue was addressed in Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 by Sundberg J. His Honour said the following (at [656]):
 
 The word "adjacent" does not just mean "next door to" or "very close to". Its meanings include "adjoining", "contiguous" and "bordering". See the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (adjoining and bordering) and the Macquarie Dictionary (contiguous). The tracks here fit those descriptions. They adjoin, border and are contiguous to the site even though they only meet it over a small area, namely the width of the track.

215 I accept what his Honour concluded about the meaning of the word. However, the context in which it appears is relevant and ultimately what must be ascertained is what the extended definition was intended to comprehend. That task is not completed by simply ascribing a meaning to one particular word. For my part, I doubt that mere connection in any form between the putative adjacent land and the land on which the public work was constructed, established or situated will engage s 251D. For example a public road might be lit by lights on poles connected by cable running parallel to the road. Those poles and lights might reasonably be viewed as a public work or part of a public work (the road). Ordinarily, one would expect that there would be one or a number of feeder power lines providing power to the network of poles, lights and cable. Putting aside the question of whether any feeder power line was itself a public work, it may be doubted that s 251D was intended to result in the land the feeder power line travelled over for its entire length (and perhaps any land over which lines in the power grid to which the feeder power line was connected and conceivably land on which any power station creating the power was located) was to be treated as land adjacent to the road simply because, at one point, that land intersected the land on which the road (and poles) was constructed.

216 The plain purpose of the extended definition is, in my opinion, to ensure, as its central objective, that areas around and immediately proximate to land on which public works were located were available (and unencumbered by native title rights and interests) to facilitate the initial construction or establishment and ongoing operation of the works. Sundberg J found in Neowarra , that access roads leading to the sites on which public works were located constituted land adjacent to the sites. However, the present factual situation is quite different. The only link between the gravel pits and the highways were the access tracks. The Northern Territory did not submit that the gravel pits were themselves public works. It does not follow from Sundberg J's conclusion that land over which very long access roads travel to connect certain sites (here, gravel pits) to a public work, and those sites themselves, are adjacent to the relevant public work. It may be, as the applicants submitted, that what is required for particular land or waters to be "adjacent" as that term is used in s 251D is that there be both connection and geographical proximity. In the present case I am satisfied that the four gravel pits used to maintain the Stuart Highway and their associated access tracks are adjacent to the highway in the sense contemplated by s 251D.

217 However, the seven gravel pits associated with the Buchanan Highway, and the very long access roads to them cannot, in my opinion, be described as adjacent to those highways. Accordingly only four of the eleven existing gravel pits fall within the scope of s 251D. In relation to the additional areas near the existing gravel pits associated with the Buchanan Highway, it follows that they are not land "adjacent" to a public work within the meaning of s 251D.

218 It follows from the reasoning concerning the meaning of "adjacent" in s 251D that the two storage dams approximately 100 kilometres from the Buchanan Highway and their access roads also were not adjacent to the highway and not comprehended by the extended definition.</text>

<tocase>Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group and Another [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/135.html</AustLII>
<text>68 Counsel for the applicants submitted that as pastoral leases did not confer a right of exclusive possession, it followed from Ward HC (at [179] [186]) that pastoral lessees had no right to exclude or limit access of native title holders to lands held under pastoral lease. The reservation in pastoral leases did not define or confine the native title right to access the land: see Ward HC (at [417]). The possibility of conflict in the exercise of the native title right and rights being exercised (or which might be exercised) by a pastoralist was said to be irrelevant in determining inconsistency of rights. Counsel for the applicants did concede, however, that if there was a conflict in activity, the activities of the pastoralists prevailed: s 9L of the Validation (Native Title) Act (NT) ("VNT Act") . Counsel for the applicants noted the determinations by the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group and Another [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 (" Alyawarr ") (at [122] and [133]) and Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283 ; (2003) 134 FCR 16 (" Ward FC ") (at [11]). Those determinations contained no qualification of the type proposed by the Pastoralists. Counsel for the applicants also noted that the applicants accepted that the determination should contain a clause to the effect that where there was a conflict in the exercise of rights, the rights of the Pastoralists prevailed.

69 In my opinion, the qualification of the right of access proposed by the Pastoralists by the inclusion of the word "limited" is unnecessary. Once it has been established by evidence that there is a native title right of access, a matter not disputed by the Pastoralists, then the right should be expressed in terms fully describing the right. The circumstances identified by the Pastoralists were instances involving the exercise of a right of access. What, in substance, the qualification sought to address was the exercise of unqualified rights by, on the one hand the native title holders exercising a right of access, and, on the other, the right of pastoralists to conduct pastoral activities exercising rights conferred by the pastoral lease. But the circumstances involving a conflict in the exercise of rights is addressed by the applicants' acceptance in their draft determination of a clause which provides that to the extent, if at all, that the exercise of native title rights and interests conflicts with the exercise of the rights and interests of the pastoral lease holders, the rights and interests of the pastoral lease holders prevail over but do not extinguish the native title rights and interests.

70 The Northern Territory submitted that, on the authority of Ward FC , this right was to be understood as a right to hunt and fish for traditional food and not to hunt livestock, so as to avoid inconsistency with the grant of the pastoral leases. This submission was adopted by the Pastoralists. The applicants did not take issue with this proposition.</text>

<text>146 The Pastoralists submitted that the rights granted by a pastoral lease included the right to construct roads, tracks, laneways, mustering routes and like improvements. Since a pastoralist could establish a right of way, it was submitted that the pastoralist must have a right to use it at will. The right to exercise a right of way meant that native title rights could not co-exist with such rights, as both rights could not be exercised at the same time. The Pastoralists referred by analogy to Fourmile v Selpam Pty Ltd (1998) 80 FCR 151.

184 In the present case, the main pipeline was constructed by NT Gas for its own benefit as a supplier of gas to both NTEC and, at least potentially, others. While the supply of gas by NT Gas was essential to sustaining electricity generation by, at that time, a statutory authority (NTEC), it cannot be said that the construction was on behalf of NTEC. While the case concerned entirely different legal issues, some general support for this approach is found in the observations of the High Court in NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority [2004] HCA 48 ; (2004) 219 CLR 90 (at [164] and following). Where infrastructure and utilities historically operated and controlled by government are operated and controlled by trading corporations, it is difficult to treat those corporations as part of the government or protected by a derivative Crown immunity.</text>

<text>183 What must be determined is whether against this factual background, the pipelines were constructed on behalf of NTEC. The expression "on behalf of" has no fixed legal meaning: see R v Toohey; ex parte Attorney General (NT) [1980] HCA 2 ; (1980) 145 CLR 374 at 386. It may be used when speaking of an agency relationship or the relationship of trustee and beneficiary but can be used in relation to quite ephemeral relationships. The expression's meaning will be substantially determined by context. In my opinion, the expression "on behalf of" is, in context, intended to comprehend the construction or establishment of a public work where its construction or establishment is done by the Crown or an emanation of the Crown indirectly rather than directly. That is, the work is constructed by a person or body for the Crown or an emanation of the Crown.</text>

<text>43 It is convenient at this point to address Yarabala's position, as embodied in the written submissions it ultimately relied on. Yarabala's position appeared to be that the non-exclusive native title rights and interests claimed in respect of the land and waters subject to the current pastoral leases were not native title rights and interests within the meaning of s 223(1)(a) of the NTA. Yarabala's submissions were brief and not easy to follow. As I understood them, however, its submissions were not consistent with now settled principles concerning the construction and application of the NTA. Yarabala submitted that the applicants' evidence established that the traditional laws and customs of the applicants did not now, and never had, comprehended anything less than exclusive rights, and the evidence did not show that the traditional customs observed had evolved to accommodate such a qualification. Yarabala characterised the applicants' argument as being that if one or more of the rights and interests in the bundle comprising native title was partially inconsistent with the valid grant of inconsistent rights, then the remnant was a partially extinguished native title right and interest. Yarabala submitted that such a case could not succeed, firstly because the idea of degrees of inconsistency had been rejected by the High Court in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 (" Ward HC " ) , and secondly, because the applicants' evidence did not establish that the non-exclusive rights and interests claimed in relation to the current pastoral leases were possessed under traditional laws and customs.

44 I do not propose to deal with Yarabala's submissions at length. For the reasons the applicants have given in their written submissions, Yarabala's submissions should be rejected. They involve an unsupportable amalgam of concepts concerning the content of traditional laws and customs and the nature of rights which might be capable of recognition under the NTA. In so far as Yarabala invited precision in relation to the claim area, that will, I apprehend, be achieved. To the extent that I am being invited by Yarabala to express conclusions about the existence or otherwise of rights and interests which might be recognised under the NTA in relation to areas outside the claim area, it is inappropriate for me to do so. The scope of these proceedings and the path they have taken flowed from procedural orders made on earlier occasions (see [29]). It was too late for Yarabala to seek to alter the course of the proceedings.

45 NT Gas filed points of response and took an active role in the proceedings. The position of NT Gas was that its interests in the claim area wholly extinguished native title in the relevant areas. Its submissions are considered under "Issue 4: extinguishment public works land".

97 The applicants then proposed an alternative formulation which they submitted better accorded with the evidence than the claimed right as originally expressed. The reformulation was a "right to light fires on the non-exclusive areas for domestic purposes". The applicants contended that this embraced the domestic purposes of cooking, heating and lighting, but would not cover burning off country and was not inconsistent with the rights under the pastoral leases. Further, the applicants submitted that laws like the Bushfires Act 1980 (NT) did not prohibit the lighting of fires for any of the purposes contemplated by the claimed native title right. Relying on Ward HC (at [26]), the applicants submitted that native title was not extinguished by the existence of statutory powers which if exercised would do no more than regulate the exercise of the native title right without abrogating it, and that although powers in Part III of the Bushfires Act might regulate the exercise of the claimed right, they did not extinguish it. Yarabala resisted this argument and submitted that this was not a regulation of the type contemplated by the High Court in Ward HC .

98 There existed a minor area of contention between the applicants, on the one hand, and the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists on the other, concerning this right. The issue concerned what the claimed right as formulated did and did not comprehend. Relying on Ward HC , the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists submitted that there could be no native title right to burn country. They contended that any right to light fires other than for purposes of cooking, heating and light, was inconsistent with the grant of a pastoral lease. The uncontested evidence, which I accept, was that not only were fires used for cooking and heating but for other purposes which included burning bark for domestic purposes, boiling foliage for medicinal purposes and manufacturing nulla nullas. These purposes are adequately described by the simple formulation proposed by the applicants, namely "domestic purposes". Indeed, the use of the catch all, "other domestic purposes", in the Northern Territory's and the Pastoralists' formulations would, as a matter of construction, extend the right to cover all domestic purposes. That is what the applicants proposed. The applicants' formulation is to be preferred in describing what the right comprehends.

99 It was accepted by counsel for the applicants that on the evidence there was no right to set alight vast grasslands in order to regenerate the country or as an aid to hunting. Indeed, no such right had ever been claimed. However, there appeared to be no dispute that, as I was informed by senior counsel for the Northern Territory, in other Aboriginal societies in the Northern Territory, fires are used for these purposes. The expression "domestic purposes" might be viewed as comprehending such activities and it is, on balance, desirable that it be made clear that the right does not extend to such activities. Accordingly, it is appropriate to include the words "but not for the clearance of vegetation".

105 Counsel for the applicants submitted that the claimed right did not involve an assertion of a right to control access and exclude others from the land. It was submitted that a contention that the claimed right did or might involve such an element had been rejected in two judgments of the Full Court of this Court, being Ward FC (at [24]-[25]) and Alyawarr (at [136]-[140]). There is little room to doubt that this is correct. On the assumption that I accept, which I do, that these authorities establish that a right expressed in the terms proposed by the applicants does not involve an assertion of a right to control access and exclude others from the land, the Northern Territory did not press its contentious words of qualification or clarification. However, the Pastoralists did press the issue. In view of what has now been said by the Full Court on two occasions, it is inappropriate that words of qualification or clarification be included when they are demonstrably unnecessary.

106 The Northern Territory agreed with this claimed right, subject to the inclusion of the clause referred to at [27]. The Pastoralists opposed the inclusion of this claimed right in its entirety. The Pastoralists contended that rights to trade, share or exchange were not rights in relation to land and therefore not recognisable by the common law. The issue was pressed only to preserve the right to argue the matter on appeal, and they acknowledged that the Court was bound to reject the submission on the basis of the Full Court's decision in Alyawarr .

107 The issue concerning this right can be dealt with briefly. I reject the Pastoralists submission, as they accepted I was bound to, that the claimed right was not one in relation to land.

114 There was no real issue about the applicable principles. They can be gleaned from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ward HC (at [219]-[221]). The designation of land as a reserve for certain purposes does not, without more, create any right in the public or any section of the public which by reason of inconsistency extinguished native title rights and interests. Whether a particular native title right continued in existence or was extinguished depended upon other considerations, particularly what, if any, rights in others were created by the reservation or later asserted by the executive. In the present case it is sufficient to focus on the circumstances which existed in 1971 which had been brought about by the initial reservation and the approval of the land as a depot for depositing garbage. Those circumstances were that the land was reserved for a public purpose namely as a garbage reserve and, it can be inferred, garbage from the township was to be deposited in the reserve. Both a right to deposit garbage and an implied obligation to do so been created by that time. The question then was whether this was consistent with the continuation of the native title rights agreed or determined in this matter.

115 In my opinion, the creation of a right to deposit garbage coupled with an implied obligation on third parties to do so involved an assertion of a power to determine how the land should be used which was inconsistent with the continuation of what might be described as some of the core native title rights in this matter such as to travel over, move about and have access to the land, to hunt and fish, as well as to live on the land. The power was exercised for the purpose of the land being used as a garbage dump. Its use in this way would inhibit, and probably significantly, the exercise of the rights just described. The assertion of the power concerning use was inconsistent with the continuation of those rights and they were extinguished.

116 The issues that arose in respect of the land in the claim area subject to historical and current non-exclusive pastoral leases were:
 
 1. whether or to what the rights granted by historical pastoral leases over NT Portions 797, 851, 908, 2093, 4232, 4273, 4274 and the town of Newcastle Waters were inconsistent to any extent with the claimed native title rights;
 2. in relation to NT Portions 851, 908 and 2093 presently held under pastoral leases, the extent to which the claimed native title rights were extinguished by the construction of improvements.</text>

<text>82 The Northern Territory and the Pastoralists contended that the Full Court's decision ought not be followed, for two reasons. Firstly, it was said that the pastoral leases in Alyawarr were not current leases under which pastoral activities were occurring, and secondly, the decision of the Full Court was attended by error. The applicants submitted that the contention that the Full Court had erred could not be maintained because the decision was binding authority. Further, they submitted that Alyawarr could not be distinguished on the basis advanced by the Northern Territory because the relevant inquiry was about inconsistency of rights, not activity. Further, in Alyawarr (at [218]-[227]), the same arguments about a right to live on land were advanced in relation to a current Crown lease, and were rejected. The Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (" De Rose (No 2) ") had also recognised a similarly worded right in relation to lands which had been continuously subject to pastoral leases for over 60 years and remained so at the time of trial and determination. The applicants also submitted that the qualification proposed by the Northern Territory and the Pastoralists suggested a right on the part of the lessee to exclude the native title holders should they remain on the land any longer than "temporarily", which was contrary to the principle that pastoral leases did not confer a right to exclude native title holders from the land established in Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1 (" Wik ") at 120-121, 146-147, 154-155, 190-195, and Ward HC (at [179]-[186] and [417]).</text>
