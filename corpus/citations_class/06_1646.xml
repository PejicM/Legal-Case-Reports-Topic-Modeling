<tocase>Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] ATPR 42-106</tocase>
<text>16 It is appropriate to consider each advertisement, as viewed by a consumer, in its entirety, taking account of content and presentation and also the circumstances in which it was published ( Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v Glaxosmithkline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] ATPR 42-106 at [24]). The message conveyed by the advertisements is for the Court to determine ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719 ).

25 The significance of an elucidator in similar terms was considered by the Full Court in Astrazeneca . In that case, the GOAL study referred to in the advertisements was said to be based on observations of clinical tests undertaken with ' 3416 patients with uncontrolled asthma ' and no more (at [48]). The elucidator represented that, in that study, 41% of patents achieved "total control" of asthma symptoms and 71% achieved "well controlled" asthma for periods of 7 out of 8 weeks over the 12 month study by using the promoted product, "Seretide Total Control" (at [43]). The elucidator, in those specific advertisements, did not allow inferences to be drawn by the reader that all, virtually all, or even a majority of asthma patients, would achieve total control of asthma symptoms by using Seretide (at [43]).

26 In considering the advertisements then before it, the Full Court recognised that the significance of footnotes to which a consumer's attention is drawn depends on the material in question and the surrounding circumstances in each individual case (at [22]). This is not limited to questions of format.

27 In the present case, I am of the view that the invitation to generalise is stronger and more comprehensive than in the advertisements considered in Astrazeneca . It is clear from the Summer Glow advertisements as a whole that the message conveyed was that, as a generalisation and supported by the "use test", 7 out of 10 "Holiday Skin users" preferred Summer Glow. The message conveyed is that the study supported the generalisation and that, as a properly conducted and representative test, the preference of those women should be extrapolated to the population of Holiday Skin users. It cannot be said that if, for example, the 105 women had been carefully chosen from a population of Dove aficionados who had once used Holiday Skin, the representation was other than misleading. It follows that if the results or methodology of the study do not support the generalisation sought to be drawn, the fact that the surveyed population expressed the stated preference does not prevent the advertisements from being misleading.

28 Johnson contends that the advertisements emphasise the tanning aspect of the products and that the user preference claim relates directly to the tanning attributes of the products: that is, that 7 out of 10 Holiday Skin users preferred Summer Glow because it gives a better tanning effect. It submits that the "heart of the ads" is the reference to "the best summer tan", emphasised in the television advertisement by the exhortation to ' think again '. Johnson submits that Unilever intended to communicate superiority in terms of performance attributes and, in particular, that the television advertisement stresses tanning rather than moisturising or other attributes such as fragrance. Johnson makes these submissions with an eye to what it says is a disconformity between the study (which relevantly measured "7 out of 10" as a general preference) and the advertisements (which communicate performance superiority as to tanning).

29 Unilever contends that the competing products are sold as body lotions with a tanning component. The products are sold in the "moisturiser" section of the supermarkets, rather than among self-tanning or sunscreen products, where they are marketed as moisturisers that give a tan rather than as tanning agents. Unilever submits that the emphasis in the television advertisement is on the body lotion and the moisturising capacity of the body lotion that, additionally, provides for tanning; that is, a moisturiser with a hint of tanning where use will moisturise the skin and build a gentle tan.

69 In order to determine whether there has been a contravention of s 52(1) of the Act, ' it is necessary to determine whether or not the conduct complained of amounted to a representation which has or would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct...has been directed ' ( Astrazeneca at [34]).

70 Where the persons to whom the conducted is directed are not identified individuals, but members of a class to which the conduct is directed in a general sense, it is necessary to isolate a representative member of that class ( Campomar at [103]). The question then is whether a misconception is likely to arise on the part of that representative consumer from the conduct alleged ( Campomar at [103]); Astrazeneca at [34]). For there to be a contravention of s 52 , the ordinary or reasonable representee must be shown to labour under some erroneous assumption ( Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 200; Campomar at [104]). The question is whether any misconceptions or deceptions alleged to arise from the advertisements are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the class of the public towards whom the conduct has been directed ( Campomar at [104] [105]; Astrazeneca at [37]).

108 The distinction between the advertisements in this case and those in Astrazeneca illustrates why Johnson's criticism of the age of the population tested is made out. The appellant in Astrazeneca complained that patients with significant concomitant diseases, smokers and children under 12 years of age had been excluded from the study of ' 3416 patients with uncontrolled asthma ' upon which the advertisements were based. This was said to give rise to a misrepresentation that the results of the GOAL study would likely be achieved in clinical practice. No mention was made in the advertisements of the fact that the GOAL study did not include those patients. However, no contravention of s 52 of the Act arose because ' none of the flyers or advertisements represented that the GOAL Study patients were representative of the asthma suffering members of the community at large ' (at [48]).

109 Unilever chose to exclude certain women of certain ages from the study and now submits that age is not relevant to the outcome. Johnson has not established that the exclusion of women under 25 in fact biased the results but does not need to do so. Women of a variety of age groups, including those who appear to be in the under 25 age group, are portrayed in the television advertisement. The print advertisement invites "every woman", regardless of age, to use Summer Glow. The assertion of preference is thereby represented to be over the class of all women, or at least women over a range of ages that clearly includes under 25's.

110 The advertisements should be considered, in their totality, as directed to women without age restriction. The context of the advertisements was that a new market had been established. Previously, there was a market in tanning agents, moisturisers and sunscreens. Johnson established a new market in moisturisers that had a tanning effect. Unilever wished to enter that market and to take customers from Johnson as well as to expand the market. Unilever's existing market for its Dove products was, I infer from Mr Kibble's evidence absent Unilever submitting to the contrary, largely in the age group of 25 to 45 year old women. Johnson's market was particularly significant in the under 25 year old age group. The representation asserts a preference for Summer Glow by Holiday Skin users. However, the population surveyed excluded a substantial proportion of those users in circumstances where Unilever was, at least in part, targeting Johnson's market in which the under 25's were a substantial class. Where the conclusion drawn from the study should have been based on the Johnson user cohort, it was based on the Dove user cohort.</text>

<tocase>Bateman v Slatyer (1987) 71 ALR 553</tocase>
<text>117 The advertisements were not a mere reporting of the study. Unilever did not expressly hold itself out as having itself conducted the market research but it did present the market research as capable of generalisation to all Holiday Skin users; it did not qualify the variants used and it represented that the "7 out of 10" general preference was a preference for the tanning attributes of the products. By presenting the preference claim including the elucidator in this manner, Unilever conveyed the impression that the study provided a basis for the representations ( Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88). A statement of opinion cannot be regarded as false or misleading or as misleading and deceptive simply because it is incorrect ( Global Sportsman at 88; Bateman v Slatyer (1987) 71 ALR 553 at 559). However, in this case, as in RAIA at 175, it is implicit in the statement of the comparison that Unilever had ascertained that the facts justified the opinion it presented.</text>

<text>116 The more specialised the report or the more remote from the corporation's area of business, the easier it will be to establish that the corporation is merely passing on the information "for what it's worth". In Harkins v Butcher [2002] NSWCA 237 ; [2005] 55 NSWLR 558, for example, the New South Wales Court of Appeal found that an agent who distributed a brochure incorporating a copy of a survey diagram to purchasers was not liable for a contravention of s 52 on the basis that ' the recipients would know that the agents did not hold themselves out as professional surveyors, and had not carried out the survey themselves ' (at [47]). The Court of Appeal's decision was affirmed by a majority of the High Court, who had regard to the nature of the parties, the character of the transaction and the contents of the brochure itself in deciding that the agent ' did no more than communicate what the vendor was representing, without adopting it or endorsing it ' ( Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at [40] ).</text>

<tocase>Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The question for the Court is whether reasonably minded members of the class of consumers to whom each advertisement is directed would take from it the representation which is alleged: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [103] .

18 By its amended statement of claim, Johnson alleges that the representations in each advertisement are:
 
 (a) that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes ('the first representation'); 
 (b) that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin, with respect to each of the four respective product variants (Fair to Normal and Normal to Darker) ('the second representation');
 (c) that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin ('the third representation'); and
 (d) that Summer Glow is the best tanning body lotion available ('the fourth representation').

19 The first and second representations are said to raise for determination the construction of the advertisements. The third and fourth representations raise the validity of the market research.

70 Where the persons to whom the conducted is directed are not identified individuals, but members of a class to which the conduct is directed in a general sense, it is necessary to isolate a representative member of that class ( Campomar at [103]). The question then is whether a misconception is likely to arise on the part of that representative consumer from the conduct alleged ( Campomar at [103]); Astrazeneca at [34]). For there to be a contravention of s 52 , the ordinary or reasonable representee must be shown to labour under some erroneous assumption ( Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 200; Campomar at [104]). The question is whether any misconceptions or deceptions alleged to arise from the advertisements are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the class of the public towards whom the conduct has been directed ( Campomar at [104] [105]; Astrazeneca at [37]).

114 A contravention of s 52 may occur even when a corporation is acting reasonably and honestly ( Campomar at [103] citing Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 197). A corporation will not be liable for merely relaying false information when it is clear that the corporation does not adopt the information ( Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666). However, the fact that a corporation acts honestly and reasonably and does not intend to mislead or deceive does not necessarily absolve it from liability ( Parkdale at 197; Yorke ). It is a matter of fact in each case. Unilever submits that the reference to the "use test" in the elucidator would lead the consumer to understand that it had been carried out bona fide by a research house and that Unilever relied upon it. That representation was true.</text>

<tocase>Gardam v George Wills &amp; Co Ltd (1988) 82 ALR 415</tocase>
<text>115 It is the case that the study was a specialised report. It can not be said, however, that the study was remote from Unilever's business. Unilever is engaged in the sale of consumer products to the public and conducts advertising to sell those products. It was not suggested that Unilever had no knowledge or understanding of market surveys. Indeed, Unilever issued sophisticated instructions to Colmar Brunton and indicated in clear terms the result it wished to achieve. It cannot be said that Unilever in any way disclaimed a belief in the truth or falsity of the comparison or the study on which it was based or was merely ' passing it on for what it is worth ' ( Yorke at 666). To the contrary, the results of the study were conveyed to the public as part of an integrated advertising campaign. In the circumstances, Unilever adopted them; it was not a ' mere conduit ' ( Gardam v George Wills &amp; Co Ltd (1988) 82 ALR 415 at 427).</text>

<tocase>Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629</tocase>
<text>39 The preference claim is qualified by the elucidator. However, there can be no doubt that Unilever intended to communicate superiority. This is not a case of "mere puffery" ( Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [44]). That asserted superiority was in terms of performance attributes, rather than other attributes such as fragrance. While Mr Kibble may have intended the testing to be of ' the performance of the product and its sensory appeal (skin feel and fragrance)' (emphasis added), the advertisement made no reference to fragrance and little or no reference to sensory, in contrast to tanning performance, appeal.

40 It follows that I accept Johnson's submission that the message communicated by the commercial is that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes. The first representation was made in the television advertisement.

41 The print advertisement states that Summer Glow ' combines rich body lotion with a hint of self tanning agents ' and includes in its list of the product's attributes ' everyday body moisturiser ' and ' gradually builds a beautiful light tan '. This places greater emphasis than does the television advertisement on the moisturising capacity of the product.

76 Comparative advertising does not create any presumption with respect to a breach of the Act ( Energizer at [20]). However, as Heerey J pointed out in Energizer , the more actual comparison is used, the more potential there is for error and half-truth (at [20]). The factual assertions must be ' not untrue, or misleading half-truths ' (at [22]). Lindgren J discussed at [34] the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement to be making reference. In that case, it was conceded that, if the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement was referring was all Energizer batteries rather than the one particular battery the subject of comparison, the advertisement was misleading or deceptive.

77 Unilever's reliance on the failure by Johnson to establish that a different preference would have been expressed had all four variants been tested by the study is ill-founded. The fact is that the study simply did not include the two variants of Holiday Skin or compare them to both variants of Summer Glow. The reasonable consumer would have understood, in the absence of qualification, that the user preference was found to exist across all variants, or at the least, to a comparison of each comparable variant, when no such preference had been expressed in the "use test".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/11.html</AustLII>
<text>24 That is not, however, the totality of the representation in these advertisements. A statement which is literally true may still be misleading and deceptive if it conveys to others ' something more than the literal meaning which the words spelled out ' ( Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 227). The elucidator, which refers to the "leading research company" is used to validate an assertion that the "7 out of 10" preference relates to Holiday Skin users generally, not to restrict it. The television advertisement portrays a group of women who are presented as representative of women generally. There is no suggestion that these women personally participated in the "use" test, but there is, in my view, a clear assertion that Summer Glow is the better product because the results of the market research can be extrapolated to them. The print advertisement expands the application to "every woman" or, at least, every user of Holiday Skin.</text>

<tocase>Janssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd (1986) 6 IPR 227</tocase>
<text>105 Unilever has represented to the consumer that the preference exhibited by Holiday Skin users is supported by the "use test". The study was silent as to the preference of Holiday Skin users under the age of 25, who represented a substantial proportion of those users. The onus is on Johnson to establish that the representation was misleading and deceptive but, following Burchett J's observations in Janssen Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd (1986) 6 IPR 227 at 234, if Johnson establishes that there is no foundation in the study for a statement in the advertisements, that may be sufficient proof that the statement is misleading. As his Honour recognised, the question is whether the context in which the representation is made implies that adequate foundation exists for making it. Johnson submits that the claim made was not supported to the degree that the ordinary and reasonable consumer would understand and that the evidentiary onus shifts to Unilever to show that consumers will not be mislead.

106 A comparison, said to be supported by a "use test" conducted by a "leading research company", gives the impression that the study has been carefully conducted and that the results support the precise statement made. A reader or viewer, seeing the reference to the leading research company, would understand that the study had been conducted properly and with care and that it fully supported the claim based upon it (cf RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited (1993) 41 FCR 164 at 166). As in Janssen , the context of these advertisements must be, or is likely to be, taken as implying that there is an adequate foundation in the market research to enable the statement to be made. If Unilever chose to advertise that comparison, it was obliged to ensure that it did not mislead the public. The making of such a comparison, without adequate foundation, is misleading.</text>

<tocase>Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (2006) 69 IPR 232</tocase>
<text>4 Johnson applied to the Court for an interlocutory injunction to restrain Unilever from so advertising Summer Glow. Justice Tamberlin granted interlocutory relief ( Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (2006) 69 IPR 232 (' Johnson (No 1) ').

5 The proceedings now are before the Court for final orders. The issues that arise are:
 
 (1) What representations are made by the Summer Glow advertisements?
 (2) Are those representations misleading and deceptive?
 (3) Is Unilever liable for any contravention of s 52 of the Act?

6 Johnson alleges that Unilever contravened the Act by representations made in three advertisements:
 
 &#8226; a television advertisement, first broadcast on national television on 27 March 2006 ('the television advertisement');
 &#8226; a print advertisement, first published in the print media in April 2006 ('the print advertisement'); and
 &#8226; an online advertisement, first published at http://www. dovefacecare.com.au ('the website') on or about 28 March 2006 ('the internet advertisement').</text>

<text>78 The study did, of course, test the comparable Dove and Johnson light variants. For this reason, it may be that the second representation is closer to a "half-truth" than the first representation. However, if a bald preference claim is suggested by the "elucidator" and that claim requires qualification, then to make it without qualification is misleading ( Reiffel v ACN 075 839 226 [2003] FCA 194 ; (2003) 132 FCR 437 at [38] and [48] [50]). Unilever knew that the Johnson dark variant was on the market at the time it published the advertisements but no qualification was given in respect of the variants tested. The bald preference claim was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive the consumer to whom it was directed.

79 As to the third and fourth representations, Johnson accepts that 73 % of participants in the study preferred Summer Glow and that that result, as a matter of mathematics, is capable of supporting a general preference claim of 7 out of 10. Johnson contends, however, that the deficiencies in the study methodology mean that no preference claim is justifiable.

80 Unilever makes a number of overarching submissions:
 
 &#8226; Johnson accepts that Colmar Brunton is a reputable market research company.
 &#8226; No suggestion was made that Colmar Brunton participated in the formulation of a study designed to secure a particular result.
 &#8226; The most that Johnson's evidence can suggest is that certain variations in the study methodology might have given different results but this is mere speculation.
 &#8226; In the absence of proof that the results would have been so different that the making of the alleged representation by Unilever was misleading or likely to be so, Johnson has not discharged the onus to prove a breach by Unilever of s 52.</text>

However, the fact that a corporation acts honestly and reasonably and does not intend to mislead or deceive does not necessarily absolve it from liability ( Parkdale at 197; Yorke ). It is a matter of fact in each case. Unilever submits that the reference to the "use test" in the elucidator would lead the consumer to understand that it had been carried out bona fide by a research house and that Unilever relied upon it. That representation was true.

115 It is the case that the study was a specialised report. It can not be said, however, that the study was remote from Unilever's business. Unilever is engaged in the sale of consumer products to the public and conducts advertising to sell those products. It was not suggested that Unilever had no knowledge or understanding of market surveys. Indeed, Unilever issued sophisticated instructions to Colmar Brunton and indicated in clear terms the result it wished to achieve. It cannot be said that Unilever in any way disclaimed a belief in the truth or falsity of the comparison or the study on which it was based or was merely ' passing it on for what it is worth ' ( Yorke at 666). To the contrary, the results of the study were conveyed to the public as part of an integrated advertising campaign. In the circumstances, Unilever adopted them; it was not a ' mere conduit ' ( Gardam v George Wills &amp; Co Ltd (1988) 82 ALR 415 at 427).</text>
