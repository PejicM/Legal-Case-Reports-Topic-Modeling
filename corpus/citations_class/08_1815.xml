<text>5 I take the law to be set out in my judgment in Erduran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 814 (2002) 122 FCR 150 at [18] - [28] . That judgment was subsequently followed at first instance in Applicant VCAD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1005. On appeal, the Full Court, at the very least, cited without disapproval the judgment in Erduran . See VCAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 1 at [13] in the judgment of Gray J and at [33]-[34] in the joint judgment of Sundberg and North JJ.</text>
