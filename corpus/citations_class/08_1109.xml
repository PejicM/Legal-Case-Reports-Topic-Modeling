<text>27 Section 447A of the Act empowers the Court to make such order as it thinks appropriate about how Pt 5.3A is to operate in relation to a particular company. The section is broad enough to permit the making of an order that has some retrospective effect, and, in particular, the effect of overcoming the ending of an administration that has occurred by the operation of the Act; see Re Greg Sewell Forgings Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 602 ; Re Madden (1996) 20 ACSR 10.</text>
