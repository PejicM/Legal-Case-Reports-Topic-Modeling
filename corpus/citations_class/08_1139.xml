<tocase>Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly GenRx Pty Limited) v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2008] FCA 607</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/607.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 8 May 2008 I delivered reasons in Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly GenRx Pty Limited) v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2008] FCA 607 (' Apotex v Servier ') following Apotex Pty Ltd's ('Apotex') application to the Court in relation to a claim that Les Laboratoires Servier and Servier Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd (together 'Servier') had breached ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') in the course of advertising and promoting one of its drugs, Coversyl. The subject matter was a stamp distributed to doctors by Servier which contained the phrase "brand substitution not permitted" and four advertisements (two banner advertisements and two full page advertisements). Apotex alleged that they each contained representations which were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive under the Act.

2 My findings are set out in Apotex v Servier at [151]. For convenience and in summary those findings were:
 
&#8226; that the stamp issued by Servier to doctors to be printed on prescriptions for Coversyl contains representations that are misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive pharmacists and patients within s 52 of the Act;
 
&#8226; that Servier is liable for the stamp representations and has thereby contravened s 52 of the Act;
 
&#8226; that representations contained in the first and second banner advertisements were not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners; 
 
&#8226; that the first whole page advertisement caused to be published by Servier contained a representation as to improved stability that is likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners within s 52 of the Act and Servier has thereby contravened s 52 of the Act; and
 
&#8226; that the second whole page advertisement caused to be published by Servier contained a representation in relation to the indication for Coversyl for stable coronary artery disease that is likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners within s 52 of the Act and Servier has thereby contravened s 52 of the Act.

3 The parties requested that they be given the opportunity to submit draft orders to give effect to the reasons for judgment and written submissions were filed.

4 The parties have agreed on the form of declarations. I will make those declarations.

18 I should note that while the detail of the calculation of costs is not for me, I do not necessarily accept or understand why Servier says that it has succeeded totally on the issue of patient confusion. I note in particular my findings in respect of the use of the stamp in Apotex v Servier at [151].

19 The parties have indicated that they wish to make some further submissions on costs. Accordingly I will make the orders as currently determined and a specific costs order will follow.

 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

<tocase>Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Vidtech Gaming Services Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 229</tocase>
<text>8 In relation to this aspect of the proposed orders I make the following observations. First, as to whether there should be orders or whether undertakings are sufficient:
 
&#8226; The undertakings reflect what Apotex has called ' the Court's disapproval of the respondents' conduct ' and also reflect the outcome of the proceedings. 
 
&#8226; The undertakings, which are in place and have been since April 2007, are offered on a permanent basis. They are no longer made without admissions. They cover the same ground as the proposed injunctions concerning the representations; a matter referred to by Wilcox J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Vidtech Gaming Services Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 229 at [100]. 
 
&#8226; There is no suggestion that Servier has breached the undertakings since they were given in April 2007.
 
&#8226; It is not for the Court to consider the potential forensic benefits to either party of making orders in the form of injunctions, rather than accepting undertakings. 
 
Secondly, as to the content of orders or undertakings:
 
&#8226; The orders proposed by Apotex would restrain Servier from using any part of the advertisements. Those advertisements, especially with respect to the first full page advertisement, contained representations that were not found to be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. The proffered undertakings focus more on the actual representations that were found to be in contravention of s 52 of the Act. It is the representations that should be the subject of any proposed undertakings and not the advertisements themselves. On the other hand, the proposed undertakings seek only to restrict the placing of any further advertisements which make reference to "improved stability" or to the Europa trial. I see no reason to limit the undertaking or order to the placing of advertisements which contain only the offending words or expressions. If the undertakings are not extended to mirror the wording of Apotex's proposed revised orders that relate to the representations, I would be minded to make orders in those terms.

9 Apotex seeks orders for the destruction of a range of material. If the undertakings are in place, Servier cannot use the advertisements. I accept that it is appropriate that Servier destroy all copies of the offending advertisements and the offending stamp in its possession. I do not, however, have sufficient evidence to enable me to comprehend what is encompassed by the destruction of the other material referred to in Apotex's proposed order, such as instruction manuals, and I do not propose to extend an order for destruction to those materials.

10 The offending stamps are in the possession of third parties, doctors, who may continue to use them despite the provision of a different version of the stamp of which Apotex does not complain. It is appropriate that Servier take all reasonable steps to recall the offending stamps.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) 35 IPR 635</tocase>
<text>12 As to the stamp, I am not satisfied that the pharmacists or patients likely to have been confused by its use on a single prescription will currently have a false impression of the substitutability of Coversyl. The patient's doctor will either have continued to prevent substitution, or will have used the new stamp, or will have permitted substitution. The evidence of confusion on the part of a pharmacist was of transient confusion. I do not accept that pharmacists, who are fully aware of generic substitution, would require corrective advertising. There can reasonably be no current misapprehension as a result of the stamp ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) 35 IPR 635 at 640 per Tamberlin J).

13 Further, the corrective advertising sought goes well beyond pharmacists and patients who may have seen a stamped prescription. The proposed corrective advertising, to all pharmacies that sell Coversyl, is likely to confuse those patients with the characteristics that led to the conclusion that they would be likely to have been confused by the stamp in the first place.

14 No reason has been advanced for not standing the matter over in relation to a damages inquiry. I will hear from the parties as to the course of that part of the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia Ltd v Switzerland Australia Health Fund Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 483</tocase>
<text>11 While the Court has the power to make an order for corrective advertising, it must consider the nature and likely effect of the proposed advertising. The time which has elapsed since the publication of the misleading advertising will usually be relevant ( Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 166 ; (1990) 18 IPR 270 at [282] per Wilcox J; Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia Ltd v Switzerland Australia Health Fund Pty Ltd (1987) 78 ALR 483 at 491 492 per Morling J). I do not see the benefit in corrective advertising. I do see that it is likely to create confusion. The stamp has been replaced. That itself is a form of correction. The advertisements were published in medical magazines. The offending representations formed only part of those advertisements. There is no evidence of the numbers of doctors who read those advertisements or of doctors who were misled by them. In my view corrective advertising, in particular in the form suggested, would create more confusion. The advertisements have not been published for some time and the public does not need current protection. It is unlikely that there are current incorrect or false impressions that require correcting and it is not, in my view, in the public interest to order corrective advertising.</text>
