<tocase>Ryder v Morley (1987) 16 FCR 257</tocase>
<text>31 In my opinion, the argument is not sustainable. In Ryder v Morley (1987) 16 FCR 257 (" Ryder v Morley "), the Full Court (Fox, Jenkinson and Wilcox JJ) rejected an identical argument in the context of s 22 of the NCA Act . The case concerned a search warrant that was issued to a detective sergeant in the Australian Federal Police. He had been seconded to the NCA to assist it with a particular investigation. The applicant argued that a search warrant that was to be executed for the purposes of the NCA investigation must be issued pursuant to, and subject to the restrictions of, the NCA Act , including in particular s 22 thereof, and that s 10 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor of s 3E) cannot be prayed in aid of the warrant.</text>

<tocase>Ryder v Morley (1986) 12 FCR 438</tocase>
<text>32 At trial in Ryder v Morley (1986) 12 FCR 438, Toohey J held that the attachment of the detective sergeant to the NCA did not deprive him of his status as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act , and nor did it deprive him of the right to seek the issue of a search warrant pursuant to s 10 of that Act. His Honour did not see anything to preclude recourse being had to s 10 of the Crimes Act , as he explained in the following passage at 441:
 
 "It is clear that he was invoking s 10 and not relying upon any provision of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 . Had a member of the Authority required a warrant for the purpose of a special function of the Authority, it was open to that member to apply to a judge of a prescribed court under s 22(1). But the warrant was sought by a member of the Australian Federal Police who satisfied a justice of the peace, by information on oath, that a warrant was justified in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 ." 
 

Toohey J also said that s 22(10) was conclusive against the applicant's argument: 
 
 "I agree with counsel for the respondents that the subsection simply means what it says and that there is no justification for reading it down. Counsel for the applicants argued that if a police officer seconded to the Authority could rely upon s 22(10) to justify the obtaining of a warrant under s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , the limitations in s 22 could be set at naught. But that is not so. The limitations in s 22 apply when the Authority relies upon a special investigation which it is conducting to obtain a search warrant in the terms of that section. But if a constable can satisfy a justice of the peace, in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , that a search warrant is justified, the justice may issue a warrant under that section. There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about s 22(10) ; in my view the subsection is designed for the sort of situation that arose in the present case." 
 

I consider that his Honour's reasoning is compelling.

33 On appeal from Toohey J, the Full Court said at 263-264:
 
 "It is submitted that, bearing in mind relevant parts of s 22 , and other provisions in the Act protective of individuals being investigated by the Authority (see ss 28-32) it cannot have been intended that the protection could be subverted by reliance on s 10(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 . We have in what we have already said attempted to show the different purposes and functions of s 10(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 and s 22 of the Act. In our view, it is not to be assumed that the latter negatives the operation of the former. Indeed, the contrary is expressly provided for: s 22(10). 
 
 We are of the view that the provisions of the Act referred to cannot properly be construed as involving any restriction on the use of s 10(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 for purposes such as those under discussion. On the contrary, once an offence is known or suspected, s 10(1) acts as a convenient corollary to s 22 and other powers of the Authority."

34 In the present case, the applicant attempted to distinguish Ryder v Morley on the ground that Toohey J and the Full Court did not know whether the search warrant was obtained in connection with an NCA special investigation. In my view, the supposed distinction is not made out. It is founded on a statement in the Full Court judgment that 'we do not know whether it was a "special investigation", which deals with a "matter relating to" a specified "relevant criminal activity", and is not confined to things used or believed to be intended to be used for the commission of a crime.' It is not clear whether the Full Court was saying that it did not know whether it was a special investigation at all, or whether it was saying that it did not know that the special investigation had the particular features it mentions. However, it does not matter. The applicant's whole argument in Ryder v Morley invited the Court to assume that a search warrant could have been issued pursuant to s 22 of the NCA Act . In other words, the argument invited the Court to assume that the search warrant in question had been sought in connection with a special investigation by the NCA. The Court was well aware that the power conferred by s 22(1) of the NCA Act could only be exercised in connection with a special investigation. The thrust of the argument the Court was addressing was that, as s 22 was available, the legislative intention was that it should apply to the exclusion of s 10 of the Crimes Act . Both Toohey J and the Full Court addressed the merits of this argument on the assumption that s 22 was available and that its conditions could have been satisfied. It follows that the observations made both by Toohey J and the Full Court concerning the relationship between s 22 of the NCA Act and s 10 of the Crimes Act were premised upon an assumption, favourable to the applicant in that case, that the warrant had been sought in order to advance a special investigation by the NCA and so could have been obtained under s 22 of the NCA Act .</text>

<text>35 For the foregoing reasons, I consider that Ryder v Morley is Full Court authority directly contrary to the argument that the applicant advances in this case. Ryder v Morley was followed by Moore J in Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder [1997] FCA 1535 (" Malubel) . One of the submissions made by the applicant in Malubel was to the effect that it was not open to the second respondent to make application under s 3E of the Crimes Act given the special provisions of s 22 of the NCA Act . His Honour dismissed the application and in doing so he referred with approval to Ryder v Morley . Moore J's decision was upheld on appeal by the Full Court (Burchett, RD Nicholson and Madgwick JJ): see Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder (1998) 88 FCR 242.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/14.html</AustLII>
<text>47 On the face of these provisions, it is impossible to confine them to evidential material that is for use in the criminal prosecution process. Material that assists the investigation of suspected offences, but which is incapable of being used in the criminal prosecution process, falls squarely within the definition of evidential material. Material of this kind would constitute something with respect to which an indictable offence has been committed or is reasonably suspected to have been committed. The expression "with respect to" has a wide meaning: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 526-527 and 556; and as to the cognate phrase 'in respect of', see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Scully [2000] HCA 6 ; (2000) 201 CLR 148 at 171.</text>

<tocase>Adler v Gardiner (2002) 43 ACSR 24</tocase>
<text>48 The definition of a 'thing relevant to an indictable offence' in s 3 refers to things that might 'afford evidence' as to the commission of an offence. This concept is not to be understood narrowly. In Adler v Gardiner (2002) 43 ACSR 24 at 29, in a passage quoted with approval by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 at 543, Hely J rejected a submission that documents fell outside the scope of a warrant issued under s 3E because the documents could never be admitted into evidence at a trial in relation to the warrant offences. His Honour said:
 
 "The submission misconceives the reach of the expression 'afford evidence'. Bearing in mind that the power to issue a search warrant is in aid of a criminal investigation, a thing may afford evidence as to the commission of an offence, even though it may not be admissible in evidence at a trial: George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 119. A thing will afford evidence of the commission of an offence if it assists, directly or indirectly, in disclosing that an offence has been committed, or in establishing or revealing the details of the offence, the circumstances in which it was committed, the identity of the person or persons who committed it or any other information material to the investigation of those matters: George v Rockett (supra) at 120. The expression 'will afford evidence' does not import a requirement that the documents must necessarily be sufficient to achieve a conviction; it is sufficient that they have relevance to or probative connection with, an issue arising upon an allegation of the offence alleged: Parker v Churchill (1985) 9 FCR 316 at 326. That includes things which are adjectivally relevant as well as things which are of substantive relevance: Ozzy Tyre &amp; Tube Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2000] FCA 891 at [30] - [31] ." 
 

The argument that evidential material cannot be made the subject of a s 3E warrant unless it is for use in the criminal prosecution process is similarly flawed.</text>

<tocase>Hart v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/392.html</AustLII>
<text>49 In Hart v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384 (" Hart ") at 399-403, the Full Court (French, Sackville and RD Nicholson JJ) explained the approach that should be adopted to the construction of Pt 1AA. The Court said:
 
 "64. The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose. This reflects the primary object of all statutory construction which, according to Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, is 'to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute'. The importance of purpose and policy was emphasised in that case by reference to the observation of Dixon CJ in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos [1955] HCA 27 ; (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397: 'the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed.' 
 
 
 
 
 
 65. The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Rogers v Moore (1992) 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J. Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined. Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will, in accordance with authority, be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject. 
 
 66. There is a significant emphasis in the case law on the need to apply a 'strict' construction to such provisions. This is because, as a general rule, the search of premises and the seizure of goods therefrom has always been illegal unless authorised by law. The manifestation of that authority has traditionally been in the form of a warrant. ... 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 67. Where 'strict construction' is invoked it is necessary to keep in mind what that term means. In the context of penal statutes it was said, a long time ago, and yet consistently with contemporary doctrine ( Scott v Cawsey [1907] HCA 80 ; (1907) 5 CLR 132 at 155 per Isaacs J), to reflect nothing more than a requirement that: 
 
 
 'a Court should be specially careful, in the view of the consequences on both sides, to ascertain and enforce the actual commands of the legislature, not weakening them in favour of private persons to the detriment of the public welfare, nor enlarging them as against the individuals towards whom they are directed.' 
 
 
 The invocation of 'strict construction' in penal statutes was described by Gibbs J as 'perhaps one of last resort': Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55 ; (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576. It should not distract from the primary object of statutory construction enunciated in Project Blue Sky. The search and seizure provisions of the Crimes Act are not punitive. They are not to be treated as penal provisions. It is more appropriate to see them as subject to the general principles that govern statutory interference with established common law rights and freedoms: Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63 ; (1908) 7 CLR 277 at 304 per O'Connor J ; Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24 ; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 18 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15 ; (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. 
 
 68. Notwithstanding these general considerations, effect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred. The need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed was acknowledged by the learned primary judge, who referred in that connection to Dunesky v Commonwealth (1996) 89 A Crim R 372 at 382-383 per Lockhart J. See also Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 83 per Mason J. The tension between the public and private interests involved in the issue and execution of search warrants was referred to by Lockhart J in Crowley v Murphy (1981) 52 FLR 123 at 141-142 (Northrop J agreeing at 132)."

50 The Court concluded its discussion by observing that:
 
 "...there is no requirement that the Court approach that task armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers. Privacy is but one of the interests to be taken into account in construing legislation authorising the exercise of such power."

51 The applicant submitted that the Full Court's reference in par 65 to the 'gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them' supports its argument. I disagree. When the relevant passages in the judgment of the Full Court are read as a whole, it is plain that the Full Court was not suggesting that information can only be gathered under a search warrant if it serves the dual purpose of both determining whether offences have been committed and facilitating proof of them in a criminal prosecution process. Moreover, I do not consider that the Full Court was referring to proof in a criminal prosecution process, as distinct from proof in the broader context of a criminal investigation that may or may not result in a prosecution.</text>
