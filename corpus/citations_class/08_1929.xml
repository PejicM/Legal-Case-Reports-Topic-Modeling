<tocase>Apollo Shower Screens Pty Ltd v Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Corporation (1985) 1 NSWLR 561</tocase>
<text>50 The evidentiary burden on a party in Worimi's position in circumstances where the moving party must prove a negative proposition has been described in Apollo Shower Screens Pty Ltd v Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Corporation (1985) 1 NSWLR 561 (at 565) as similar to ' the evidential burden placed upon an accused in a criminal trial who seeks to raise the issue of self-defence which the Crown must disprove '.

57 All of the evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to produce and in the power of the other to have contradicted ( Apollo Shower Screens at 565). Once the Land Council has established sufficient evidence from which the negative proposition, an absence of native title, may be inferred, Worimi carries an evidential burden to advance evidence of any particular matters going to the existence of native title. It is then for the Land Council to deal with the evidence in the discharge of its overall burden of proof ( Apollo Shower Screens at 565).

58 Worimi submits that the Land Council is in a position to call all of the customary expert evidence and has not done so. The Land Council submits that Worimi is in the position to adduce evidence from other Worimi persons in support of his claim and has not done so. Each party asserts that he or it is under no obligation to provide further evidence.

60 The power of a party to adduce evidence may be relevant to the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented ( Apollo Shower Screens at 565; Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 65; Ho v Powell (2001) 51 NSWLR 572 at [15]). It may also be relevant to the standard of proof. There is, however, a distinction between the probabilities on limited material available and whether limited material provides an appropriate basis on which to reach a reasonable decision ( Ho at [14]).

188 Much has been made in submissions of which party is better able to call evidence and the effect on the proof of a negative proposition. On one hand, the Land Council has not called evidence from all the Worimi people. It has called seven witnesses, some of whom have studied Worimi history and have knowledge of Worimi laws and customs and others from Worimi's family. It has, as I have said, been authorised to bring this application. Worimi asserts that (at least) his family, as part of the Garuahgal clan, has native title rights and interests over the Land. It is Worimi who has the greater means to produce evidence from his family or from other Garuahgal or Worimi people to contradict the proposition of no native title. In particular, if Worimi asserts that Lot 576 and Kingsley Beach are a women's site of which he cannot have personal knowledge, the absence of any evidence of the laws and customs associated with that site from a woman supporting his assertion is telling. The only evidence in support of Worimi's claims was filed in respect of his claimant applications and was from Worimi's mother, who is Yorta Yorta, and from his wife, sister and daughters (Priscilla Dates changed her evidence in these proceedings), who say little more than that they take their information from Worimi and support his assertions. The failure on Worimi's part to call corroborative evidence lessens the burden of proof on the Land Council to establish the negative proposition ( Apollo Shower Screens at 565). It does not increase the burden on the Land Council.

189 I am satisfied that there has not been the necessary connection with the Land and the observance of the asserted laws and customs. This is not because of Worimi's temporary absence in Western Australia. It is because, on the evidence, I am satisfied that there was no women's site on or near Lot 576 and that there was no use of a waterhole on or near Lot 576 associated with the birth of Worimi children. If there were such a site or such use, it has long since ceased to be used. Worimi's attempt to revive such use in the case of his daughter and the birth of his grandson is insufficient to give rise to native title rights and interests in the Land.

190 The group or communal rights that form the basis of Worimi's case are in respect of the claimed women's sight on or near the Land. The characterisation of Worimi's asserted native title rights and interests has changed over time. Worimi also claims rights in respect of his own observance of traditional hunting and gathering customs on the Land. However, Worimi appears to assert that these rights are held by all Worimi people or at least by the Garuahgal clan. There is no sufficient evidence that any such rights, whether individual, group or communal, are possessed under a normative system of traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed by Worimi people or by the Garuahgal clan. Worimi's account of traditional hunting and gathering law and custom has been disputed by the Land Council's witnesses.</text>

<tocase>Bodney v Bennell (2008) 167 FCR 84</tocase>
<text>162 The Land Council relies on Worimi's own evidence to demonstrate a lack of continuity in the practices said to have been carried out on or near the Land. Worimi acknowledges that, whether or not Lot 576 and the area at Kingsley Beach are women's sites and associated with the birth of children, whether Worimi, Maaiangal or Garuahgal, there has not been a continuous connection with such people and the observance of traditional laws and customs since sovereignty. Accordingly, there has not been the requisite "connection" with the Land as required by s 223(1) of the Act ( Bodney v Bennell (2008) 167 FCR 84 at [171] [174]). This is not because of the physical presence or absence on the Land. It is because the practices of his own family, that he says are associated with the Land, were not observed at least from the time of his grandmother until his daughter went onto the Land in 2006. I accept that, at least now, Worimi feels strongly about his Aboriginal heritage. Worimi accepts that he has taken some of the customs observed by the Dunghutti people, as described and observed by his wife Cynthia, in practising with his daughter the customs connected with birth and baptism that he said were carried out on the Land and Kingsley Beach. That could be said to reflect the incorporation, in the ordinary course, of other customs and practices into the traditional forms of the Garuahgal people.

170 As was said in Yorta Yorta at [47] and repeated in Bodney at [47], if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society, a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs ( Yorta Yorta at [49]; Bodney at [46]). ' Unless a society has, and acknowledges and observes, laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed, there can be no native title rights whether communal, group or individual ' ( Bodney at [157]). It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today ( Bodney at [47]). This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted ( Bodney at [70] [74]).

171 Where individual native title rights are claimed, they arise out of and depend upon the traditional laws and customs of the community in question ( Bodney at [148]). Rights may be communally held or held by a sub-group or, indeed, by an individual, depending on the nature of the society said to be the repository of the traditional laws and customs that give rise to the native title rights and interests ( Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 at [79] and [80]). In the present case, the native title rights over a Worimi women's site would be held by Worimi women. They deny such rights for Lot 576.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth v Clifton (2007) 164 FCR 355</tocase>
<text>43 A native title determination application may only be made in accordance with the Act ( Commonwealth v Clifton (2007) 164 FCR 355 at [40] [57]) and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Act. As the Full Court noted in Clifton , stringent requirements are placed upon an applicant seeking a determination of native title. If I am not satisfied that native title does not exist, the application should be dismissed.

44 The Act does not provide for a procedure that enables a respondent to obtain a determination of native title which that party could not obtain as an applicant. The Act requires a native title claimant application to be authorised by the relevant native title claim group ( Clifton at [48]). Worimi has failed to maintain his filed claimant applications as they were not authorised by his asserted claim group, as described in each claimant application.

45 The beneficial nature of the Act does not mean that a different standard applies to the evidentiary burden and the onus of proof. Worimi has not advanced sufficient reason why the Land Council's application should not be determined on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. In any event, Worimi appears to have accepted that the applicable standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.

46 In the absence of a claimant application following the giving of notice of the making of the non-claimant application in respect of the Land, the Court is entitled to be satisfied that no other claim group or groups assert a claim to hold native title to the Land ( Clifton at [59]). At the very least, this supports an inference of an absence of native title over the Land, subject to the matters to be raised by Worimi.

47 It does not follow that the absence of a native title claim means that, without more, there is a declaration of no native title. As was recognised in the joinder of Worimi to these proceedings, Worimi's assertion of native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non-claimant application ( Worimi 2007 at [30]). Worimi may not be able to establish that native title does exist but his evidence, if accepted, may cast doubt on the Land Council's case ( Worimi 2007 at [36]).

48 It does not follow, as Worimi has previously asserted, that his inability to secure a positive native title determination means that there is no evidentiary burden on him to support his contention that there is native title. As in other proceedings, in proceedings seeking a judgment in rem that no native title exists and in proceedings arising under beneficial legislation, the Court will assess the whole of the evidence.

88 In relation to the non-claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land, the following seems to me to apply:
 
&#8226; The Act permits the making of non-claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land.
 
&#8226; This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists. The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts (s 24FA). Section 61(1) provides for non-claimant applications for native title determinations. There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings. The Minister has an interest in these proceedings, namely, to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land, that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title. The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not, and in what way, the Crown's radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests. In any event, the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings.
 
&#8226; These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists. In order to establish that native title exists, it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title ( Kokatha ; Clifton ; Worimi 2007 ).
 
&#8226; An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land. That onus applies to a civil standard. The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist.
 
&#8226; There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard.
 
&#8226; A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant's case. As I said in Worimi 2007 at [35], Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council's evidence. Worimi's assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non-claimant application ( Worimi 2007 at [30]).
 
&#8226; The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi.
 
&#8226; The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council's case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that, on the balance of probabilities, no native title exists over the Land.
 
&#8226; Accordingly, the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title. The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre-sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs. It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage. 
 
&#8226; Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title. That necessarily means native title under the Act. The evidence must address the elements of such a claim, in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre-sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present. It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title, such as continuous connection with the Land, this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non-existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal, group or individual rights. The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing, such as continuous connection. That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot, Lot 576. Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot 576 without also considering the surrounding land. The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area. The evidence needs to concern the Land. However, evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant. The question remains, however, whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot 576.
 
&#8226; It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non-claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met. In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land, the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks. Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title. It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council's case.</text>

<tocase>Derschaw v Sutton (1996) 17 WAR 419</tocase>
<text>51 Derschaw v Sutton (1996) 17 WAR 419 was a case of defensive native title to a criminal prosecution. That is, the defendants sought to establish the existence of native title as a defence. Justice Franklyn (with whom Murray J agreed) held at 431 that the defendants had to adduce or direct the Court's attention to evidence of each of the material matters necessary to establish the existence of native title. Despite Worimi's submission that the case has no precedent value, it should, as a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, be followed unless it is plainly wrong ( Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135]). Similar reasoning has been followed in other cases (see, for example, Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572; Dillon v Davies (1998) 156 ALR 142 ; Lewis v Wanganeen [2005] SASC 36). Special leave to appeal Derschaw to the High Court was refused. In my respectful opinion, it is not plainly wrong. Justice Franklyn , drawing from Mabo v The State of Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 , pointed out that, in the absence of evidence going to each element of native title, there is insufficient foundation for the claim to have legal justification. I agree, with respect, with that analysis. To establish the existence of native title under the Act, the same elements of native title apply whether native title is asserted by an applicant or by a respondent.</text>

<tocase>Gale v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2004] FCA 374</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/374.html</AustLII>
<text>74 Worimi points to Gale v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2004] FCA 374 where it was accepted that at the time of sovereignty, the lands were inhabited by organised communities of Aboriginal people who had rights and interests in the subject lands, sourced in traditional laws and customs (at [34]). The parties accepted the ' tenacious persistence of native title ' and of traditional Aboriginal culture. Justice Madgwick took account of extensive expert reports of anthropologists and historians, as well as other evidence that had been filed, to conclude that there was no native title over the lands in question. That expert evidence was available in Gale . The fact that no such evidence is available in these proceedings does not prevent a decision being reached as to whether the Land Council has satisfied the burden of establishing the absence of native title, on the basis of the evidence adduced.

75 The Land Council is not required to overcome and negative a presumption that native title exists over Lot 576.

76 Worimi points to the description of all of the land around Port Stephens as "traditional Worimi country" or in similar terms. The Minister accepts that ' it is common ground that the Land falls within traditional Worimi country '. However, the Minister does not agree that the use of such an expression or such informal identification of a region with a people, the Worimi nation, entails acceptance that there is and has at all times since 1788 been a native title holding group that is part of a society which has all the attributes that are necessary to sustain native title rights and interests in the Land under the Act.

153 Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary. In an area where non-Aboriginal communities developed, many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah, which is also part of Worimi land. In deciding whether claimants, by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, have a present connection with land, some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed ( Gale at [108], citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose ).

165 In Gale, Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew. One of the respondents, Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council, sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land. Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded. His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles, including:
 
&#8226; [N] ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia: Yorta Yorta at [75]. 
 
&#8226; The rights and interests must be presently 'possessed' under traditional laws and customs. This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed ... be a system that has had a 'continuous existence and vitality' since sovereignty: Yorta Yorta at [47]. 
 
&#8226; Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim. 
 
&#8226; The statutory questions (in s 223) are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests, not their exercise, and to the existence of a relevant, present connection. It follows that the non-exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests ... will not inevitably be fatal. 
 
&#8226; The requirement in s 223(1)(b) for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs, that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty. It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown's radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title. 
 
&#8226; It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially, and not entirely, uninterrupted. 
 
&#8226; Nonetheless, it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre-sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise. This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs. 
 
&#8226; Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty. It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them, notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society.

166 Justice Madgwick concluded at [18] that there is a stringent requirement of continuity both of the society which had the rules giving rise to native title rights and interests and of observance of those traditional laws and customs which embodied those rules. At [118], Madgwick J found that, on the available evidence, the claimants did not constitute, even as the last member, ' a society that in any presently relevant sense observes traditional laws and customs '. Aboriginality by descent and/or self-identification and acceptance as such is not enough to found a native title claim. It was not shown that there was ' a society that has continued to exist since before sovereignty and which was and is united by its acknowledgement of traditional laws and observance of traditional customs, allowing that the laws and customs may have adapted '. Those laws and customs were not shown to have had a "continuous existence and vitality" since sovereignty. Justice Madgwick concluded that there was no adequate reason not to make a determination that native title did not exist in relation to the subject land.

168 Worimi asserts laws and customs in connection with the Land which, he acknowledges, are not observed by other Worimi people. That is consistent with the evidence of the other witnesses. As in Gale , Worimi and those of his family who support his claims do not constitute a society that observes traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land. As in Gale , even if the Land was associated with the birth of children of the Garuahgal people, the present observance by Worimi and one of his daughters is ' at best an attempted re-creation of a society which may well have had native title rights and interests ' (at [119]).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1115.html</AustLII>
<text>9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 '). That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi. I will refer to him as Worimi. Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')). Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application. On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act. For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Jango v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/318.html</AustLII>
<text>32 Worimi says that, because the Land Council asserts that native title does not exist, it is required to prove the absence of each of the elements necessary to establish native title under the Act. On 19 December 2007, after Worimi had been joined and a hearing date allocated, I directed the filing of Statements of Contentions by the Land Council and by Worimi, better to understand the case being made by each of these parties. While the document that the parties were directed to file was called a Statement of Contentions, it was clearly not a pleading in the sense used in Jango v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 318 ; (2006) 152 FCR 150. In that case, the "Points of Claim" filed by the applicant was considered to define the nature of the applicant's claim.

33 Worimi says that the material facts in respect of each of the facts and contentions and in respect of each of the elements necessary to establish native title have not been articulated in the Land Council's Statement of Facts and Contentions. He treats them as equivalent to pleadings. They are not and were not intended by me to be so, nor were they understood by the Land Council as such.

34 Submissions have been made concerning what has been called ' the evidential onus ' of proof. The Land Council contends that, on establishing the matters necessary to demonstrate that the appropriate notification procedures have occurred and in the absence of a claimant application, the Court should infer that no native title exists over the Land and ' the evidential onus ' shifts to Worimi. The Land Council and the Minister both say that Worimi has ' an onus ' regarding his assertion that native title exists over the Land.</text>

<text>59 Worimi asserts that he and his immediate family may be the only Worimi people who were given native title rights and interests in the Land and, he adds, in the area from Birubi Beach to Boat Harbour, under traditional laws and customs. It follows that Worimi has the means of bringing forward evidence to establish the existence of the native title rights and interests he asserts. It is not for the Court to conduct a roving enquiry as to whether anybody, and if so who, might hold native title over the Land ( Jango v Northern Territory (2007) 159 FCR 531 (' Jango ') at [84]). In considering the evidence adduced by Worimi, it is relevant that he is the person who is able to adduce evidence of the laws and customs that he asserts he and his family practise and observe. On the other hand, he has insufficient resources to present the expert historical and anthropological evidence to substantiate his claims.</text>

<tocase>Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1057.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The onus of proof is on the Land Council, which must satisfy the legal burden on the balance of probabilities, but there is no reason to conclude that if the Land Council establishes a prima facie case of no native title, there is no onus on Worimi to adduce any evidence in support of his assertion of native title. In dealing with the defensive use of native title in Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057 , Finn J observed at [52] that a non-applicant native title claimant who is unable to obtain authorisation to make a s 61 claim stands in no different position than any person who claims native title but is unable to institute proceedings to have that claim established.

52 If the elements of native title are established by a non-applicant claimant, it can prevent a determination that native title does not exist, although it cannot secure a positive determination of native title under s 225 of the Act ( Kokatha at [50] per Finn J). However, Worimi's evidence may be sufficient to raise a doubt as to the non-existence of native title without amounting to proof necessary for a claimant application or for a finding that native title exists.

88 In relation to the non-claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land, the following seems to me to apply:
 
&#8226; The Act permits the making of non-claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land.
 
&#8226; This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists. The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts (s 24FA). Section 61(1) provides for non-claimant applications for native title determinations. There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings. The Minister has an interest in these proceedings, namely, to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land, that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title. The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not, and in what way, the Crown's radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests. In any event, the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings.
 
&#8226; These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists. In order to establish that native title exists, it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title ( Kokatha ; Clifton ; Worimi 2007 ).
 
&#8226; An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land. That onus applies to a civil standard. The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist.
 
&#8226; There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard.
 
&#8226; A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant's case. As I said in Worimi 2007 at [35], Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council's evidence. Worimi's assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non-claimant application ( Worimi 2007 at [30]).
 
&#8226; The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi.
 
&#8226; The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council's case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that, on the balance of probabilities, no native title exists over the Land.
 
&#8226; Accordingly, the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title. The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre-sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs. It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage. 
 
&#8226; Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title. That necessarily means native title under the Act. The evidence must address the elements of such a claim, in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre-sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present. It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title, such as continuous connection with the Land, this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non-existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal, group or individual rights. The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing, such as continuous connection. That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title.
 
&#8226; The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot, Lot 576. Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot 576 without also considering the surrounding land. The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area. The evidence needs to concern the Land. However, evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant. The question remains, however, whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot 576.
 
&#8226; It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non-claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met. In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land, the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks. Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title. It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council's case.</text>

<tocase>Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572</tocase>
<text>51 Derschaw v Sutton (1996) 17 WAR 419 was a case of defensive native title to a criminal prosecution. That is, the defendants sought to establish the existence of native title as a defence. Justice Franklyn (with whom Murray J agreed) held at 431 that the defendants had to adduce or direct the Court's attention to evidence of each of the material matters necessary to establish the existence of native title. Despite Worimi's submission that the case has no precedent value, it should, as a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, be followed unless it is plainly wrong ( Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135]). Similar reasoning has been followed in other cases (see, for example, Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572; Dillon v Davies (1998) 156 ALR 142 ; Lewis v Wanganeen [2005] SASC 36). Special leave to appeal Derschaw to the High Court was refused. In my respectful opinion, it is not plainly wrong. Justice Franklyn , drawing from Mabo v The State of Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 , pointed out that, in the absence of evidence going to each element of native title, there is insufficient foundation for the claim to have legal justification. I agree, with respect, with that analysis. To establish the existence of native title under the Act, the same elements of native title apply whether native title is asserted by an applicant or by a respondent.

72 In Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572, Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of, for example, genealogy. At 586 589, his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from 1788 to a later time, in that case to the 1880s. Referring to the analysis in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 2, 3 rd edition at 437, his Honour said that it is not appropriate to apply a "presumption of continuance" but a process of inference. His Honour was prepared to draw an inference from proved use of land in the 1880s back to the time before 1788. As he noted, it is more easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities. However, in Mason , there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved. Further, it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply.</text>

<text>53 The Minister submits that a party seeking to resist the making of the orders sought in a non-claimant application must adduce or identify at least some credible evidence addressing the following matters as identified in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 , De Rose v State of South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 and De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290: 
 
 
 a that at the time of sovereignty there was "a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgement and observance of a body of laws and customs" (the "pre-sovereignty society"); 
 
 b the nature and content of a normative body of laws and customs (the "traditional laws and customs") pursuant to which rights and interests were held at the time of sovereignty; 
 
 c the nature and content of the rights and interests held at the time of sovereignty pursuant to the traditional laws and customs (the "traditional rights and interests"); 
 
 d that the pre-sovereignty society has substantially maintained its identity and existence from generation to generation in accordance with the traditional laws and customs through to the present time; 
 
 e that the traditional laws and customs have been acknowledged and observed by the pre-sovereignty society and their successors, and that such acknowledgement and observance has continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty; 
 
 f that since sovereignty the pre-sovereignty society and their successors have maintained a connection with the application area and have transmitted rights and interests in relation to the application area by and in accordance with the traditional laws and customs; 
 
 g that they, the native title claim group (as a whole), acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs; 
 
 h the nature and content of the traditional laws and customs observed by members of the native title claim group; 
 
 i that, by the traditional laws and customs that are still observed by them, the native title claim group has a connection with the application area; 
 
 j that, by the traditional laws and customs that are still observed by them, the native title claim group has rights and interests in the application area; 
 
 k the nature and extent of the extant rights and interests; and, 
 
 l that such rights and interests have not been extinguished, (or if extinguishment has occurred, it is to be disregarded); and are not "antithetical to the fundamental tenets of the common law".

55 Worimi does not need to establish that native title exists on the balance of probabilities. It is for the Court to assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that native title does not exist. Worimi has identified a number of different groups, at various stages of these proceedings, that he says hold native title in the Land, including himself and his immediate family, and all Worimi people. He must also provide evidence that addresses, at the least, the Land Council's evidence that there is no native title within the principles set down in Yorta Yorta ; that there is no normative body of laws and customs in connection with the Land, the observance of which has been substantially maintained from the time of sovereignty to the present day. Worimi does not need to prove each element of native title. He is not obliged to establish native title as if it were a positive defence being asserted. He does, however, need to address native title under the Act by reference to those material matters. He must address the necessary elements sufficiently to cast doubt on the Land Council's assertion of no native title. He needs to show that there have existed traditional laws and customs in relation to the Land, the continued observance of those laws and customs and the maintenance of a connection with the Land. If he does not lead evidence as to each of those matters, elements of native title, he will need to adduce evidence, sufficient in scope and weight, as to one or more of those elements to cast doubt on the proposition that native title does not exist.

56 Worimi contends that the evidence required to discharge the Land Council's onus of proof ' may not be achieved without strict proof of historical and anthropological facts through use of widely accepted authoritative writings and expert evidence ' and ' involves consideration of the historical, archaeological, linguistic and anthropological evidence in the light of the direct testimony of Aboriginal witnesses '. Worimi says that, in determining the question of the existence or non-existence of native title on the balance of probabilities, regard should be had to the ability of the parties to adduce evidence. By this, he seems to be saying that the Court should give more weight to his evidence and discount the evidence of the Land Council. If he is, I do not accept it.

64 Based on the presumption that native title exists over the Land, Worimi contends that:
 
&#8226; It is common ground that Lot 576 falls within traditional Worimi country. 
 
&#8226; The Land Council must prove that any connection which Aboriginal people may have had with the Land under traditional laws and customs has not been maintained.
 
&#8226; In order to succeed, the Land Council must establish that traditional law and custom has ceased to be observed anywhere in "Worimi country".
 
&#8226; It is incumbent upon the Land Council to adduce evidence from Worimi people positively to assert that no laws and customs have been passed down to them by their forebears and, additionally, there needs to be expert evidence that there were a set of normative rules traditionally adopted and followed and observed by the Worimi people.
 
&#8226; Following Yorta Yorta , the Land Council must prove that pre-existing laws and customs have been substantially interrupted from what they were at sovereignty or no longer exist at all.
 
&#8226; There must be evidence of the cessation of the acknowledgement of laws and observance of customs sufficient to show that those laws and customs have been abandoned by the whole of Worimi society.

65 Worimi submits that the evidence supports the inference that there was a group of Worimi people and a society of Aboriginal people who inhabited the area around Port Stephens at the time of sovereignty. For the purposes of this application, I accept that to be the case.

66 Worimi submits that, once this is accepted, it follows that this group had some form of normative rules which regulated their society and that, once this is accepted, it follows ' as a matter of logic and reason ' that, bearing in mind the burden of proof, the Land Council is required to lead sufficient evidence:
 
(i) of the nature and existence of pre-sovereign native title rights and interests; and
 
(ii) to the effect that these pre-sovereign rights and interests are no longer observed before the Court may infer the non-existence of native title over Lot 576.

72 In Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572, Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of, for example, genealogy. At 586 589, his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from 1788 to a later time, in that case to the 1880s. Referring to the analysis in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 2, 3 rd edition at 437, his Honour said that it is not appropriate to apply a "presumption of continuance" but a process of inference. His Honour was prepared to draw an inference from proved use of land in the 1880s back to the time before 1788. As he noted, it is more easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities. However, in Mason , there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved. Further, it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply.

134 The Land Council seeks a determination of the absence of native title. That means native title under the Act. In Yorta Yorta , the High Court emphasised that native title under the Act must be understood in accordance with the definition in s 223(1) of the Act. That section provides:
 
 
 (1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and 
 
 (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.

135 In Yorta Yorta at [31], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ raised the importance of identifying whether the body of traditional law and custom that intersects with the common law for the purposes of s 223(1) of the Act is that as existing at the time of sovereignty or that existing today but connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty. Their Honours reiterated what had been said in Fejo v Northern Territory [1998] HCA 58 ; (1998) 195 CLR 96. Native title, with its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title is recognised by the common law. Their Honours went on to state that: ' An application for determination of native title requires the location of that intersection [between native title and the common law] and it requires that it be located by reference to [the Act]. In particular it must be located by reference to the definition of native title in s 223(1) '. A determination of the existence of native title is a creature of the Act ( Yorta Yorta at [32]). So too is a determination of the absence of native title.

136 A number of principles relevant to the present case were set out in Yorta Yorta: 
 
&#8226; Laws or customs in which native title rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving, therefore, from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty (at [38]).
 
&#8226; Observable patterns of behaviour may not amount to rights or interests in relation to land or waters under the Act (at [42]).
 
&#8226; Upon the Crown acquiring sovereignty, the normative or law-making system which then existed could not thereafter validly create new rights, duties or interests. Rights or interests in land created after sovereignty and which owed their origin and continued existence only to a normative system other than that of the new sovereign power are not given effect (at [43] and [44]).
 
&#8226; This does not prevent the transmission of rights and interests under traditional laws and traditional customs which existed at sovereignty. Nor does it prevent any alteration to, or development of, that traditional law and custom after sovereignty. Account may at least be taken of developments of a kind contemplated by that traditional law and custom (at [44]).
 
&#8226; "Traditional" law or custom is apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom. In the context of the Act, the term "traditional" conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions. However, in the context of the Act, "traditional" laws and customs equate to the normative rules that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown (at [46]). It follows that the mere use of the word "traditional" does not establish the normative rules necessary for the establishment of native title under the Act.
 
&#8226; The normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed, namely the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed, must have had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. Importantly, any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which right and interest must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title (at [47]).
 
&#8226; If the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs, the laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality (at [50]).

137 The Land Council relies not only upon the absence of any claimant application over the Land but also on the evidence from Aboriginal people associated with the area who have confirmed that, in their view, the native title rights and interests that Worimi asserts do not exist. The Land Council has established that no Aboriginal person other than Worimi (and some of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications) asserts that native title exists in relation to Lot 576. All of the Aboriginal witnesses called by the Land Council identified as Worimi people. All are aware of the assertions made by Worimi concerning the existence of native title in the Land and gave evidence generally rejecting those assertions. Some of those witnesses were parties to claimant applications for a determination of the existence of native title in respect of land in the Port Stephens area but none of the witnesses have filed native title claimant applications in relation to the Land or land in the immediate vicinity of Lot 576.

153 Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary. In an area where non-Aboriginal communities developed, many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah, which is also part of Worimi land. In deciding whether claimants, by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, have a present connection with land, some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed ( Gale at [108], citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose ).

163 As in Yorta Yorta , if there had been a women's site on or near the Land and Kingsley Beach, much has changed since it was used.

164 This baptism of Worimi's grandson by his daughter Beryl and wife Cynthia represents an attempt by Worimi to restore what he says his grandmother told him, as amended by his wife's practices. It does not represent continuity. Worimi has claimed that the site is sacred to all Worimi women. No woman has supported this claim, apart from some members of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications.

165 In Gale, Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew. One of the respondents, Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council, sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land. Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded. His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles, including:
 
&#8226; [N] ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia: Yorta Yorta at [75]. 
 
&#8226; The rights and interests must be presently 'possessed' under traditional laws and customs. This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed ... be a system that has had a 'continuous existence and vitality' since sovereignty: Yorta Yorta at [47]. 
 
&#8226; Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim. 
 
&#8226; The statutory questions (in s 223) are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests, not their exercise, and to the existence of a relevant, present connection. It follows that the non-exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests ... will not inevitably be fatal. 
 
&#8226; The requirement in s 223(1)(b) for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs, that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty. It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown's radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title. 
 
&#8226; It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially, and not entirely, uninterrupted. 
 
&#8226; Nonetheless, it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre-sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise. This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs. 
 
&#8226; Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty. It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them, notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society.

167 The positive assertion of native title rights and interests requires more than vague assertions of membership of a group of people and of "custodianship" of land. Worimi's facts and contentions comprehensively fail to establish the elements of native title required by s 223 of the Act. They do not establish native title within the meaning of Yorta Yorta . They do not identify the alleged content of the normative body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the pre-sovereignty society nor how those laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted. While Worimi is not required positively to establish native title in order to resist the Land Council's application, he must present evidence which is sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements that the evidence does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist.

169 As the High Court said in Yorta Yorta , the relevant laws and customs must be rules having normative content. Without that quality, there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters. Rights or interests created after sovereignty are insufficient, although there may be changes in the traditional laws and customs, at least to the extent that such changes and developments were contemplated by traditional laws and customs.

170 As was said in Yorta Yorta at [47] and repeated in Bodney at [47], if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society, a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs ( Yorta Yorta at [49]; Bodney at [46]). ' Unless a society has, and acknowledges and observes, laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed, there can be no native title rights whether communal, group or individual ' ( Bodney at [157]). It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today ( Bodney at [47]). This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted ( Bodney at [70] [74]).

184 It follows from Yorta Yorta at [51] [56] that native title, if it existed pre-sovereignty, ceases to exist for the purposes of the Act if the society, being the Worimi people, the Maiaangal clan or the Garuahgal clan, ceased to acknowledge and observe the laws and customs that Worimi describes. The rights and interests to which those laws and customs give rise are not possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed. They ceased to exist and the later adoption of the laws and customs does not give rise to rights and interests rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom.

185 The changes in Worimi's description of the persons who, he says, observe or observed the traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land have not assisted in the analysis of the evidence. As set out in Worimi 2007 and Worimi 2006 , he has changed the identification of the persons said to be relevant. As to the identification of family members in the claim group, Worimi has included, variously apart from himself, his wife and children, all his sisters and their daughters and his mother. He was not consistent in his evidence, asserting that he was bringing the claim on behalf of the Garuahgal women, his family and all Worimi people. Irrespective of the group said to hold native title over the Land, the requirements of s 223 of the Act are not satisfied. While Worimi was not required to establish native title in accordance with s 223 of the Act in order to resist the Land Council's application, given the time available to Worimi since these proceedings were commenced, he has had ample opportunity to formulate his contentions with reference to s 223 of the Act in order to cast sufficient doubt on the Land Council's case.

186 The evidence is that the observance of the traditional laws and customs ceased so far as a women's site on the Land is concerned. The evidence is not of adaptation of traditional laws and customs but of substantial interruption, amounting to cessation, of observance.</text>

<text>41 The Land Council says that the standard of proof does not change or become more onerous than the civil standard because these proceedings concern native title. It acknowledges that, in considering whether that standard has been satisfied, the Court will have regard to the objects and purposes of the Act ( Munn for and on behalf of the Gunggari People v State of Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 at [28] ) and acknowledges that it is required to prove the negative proposition: that there is no native title over Lot 576. The Land Council does contend, however, that once it adduces evidence which, if accepted, establishes the negative proposition, the evidential onus to adduce evidence to show that the negative proposition is incorrect shifts to Worimi. The Land Council does not accept that it is required to establish the negative proposition by establishing the absence of each of the elements necessary to prove the existence of native title.

42 The Land Council and Worimi appear to agree that the evidential burden shifts to Worimi if the Land Council establishes sufficient evidence from which the negative proposition of no native title may be inferred. The real difference between the parties relates to their submissions regarding what evidence is sufficient to establish the negative proposition.</text>

<text>171 Where individual native title rights are claimed, they arise out of and depend upon the traditional laws and customs of the community in question ( Bodney at [148]). Rights may be communally held or held by a sub-group or, indeed, by an individual, depending on the nature of the society said to be the repository of the traditional laws and customs that give rise to the native title rights and interests ( Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 at [79] and [80]). In the present case, the native title rights over a Worimi women's site would be held by Worimi women. They deny such rights for Lot 576.</text>

<tocase>Peter Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, State Minister under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) [2006] FCA 61</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The applicant ('the Land Council') seeks a declaration that no native title exists in land at Boat Harbour in the Local Government Area of Port Stephens, Parish of Tomaree, County of Gloucester, State of New South Wales, being Lot 576 in Deposited Plan 48823 ('the Land' or 'Lot 576'). This is a non-claimant application, commenced on 31 December 2004, for an approved determination of native title pursuant to s 13 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act'). An application may be made to the Court under Part 3 of the Act for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act). A determination made on such an application will constitute an ' approved determination of native title ' (s 13(3)(a)) unless varied or revoked (s 13(4)).

2 The Land Council is a body corporate established under s 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW) ('the NSW Act') for an area delineated under s 49 of the NSW Act and known as the Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council Area, which includes the Land. Membership of the Land Council is not confined by statute to persons with a traditional association with the area but, by s 54(2A) of the NSW Act, is open to adult Aboriginal persons who either reside within the Land Council's area or have a sufficient association with that area. Membership is also open to Aboriginal owners in relation to land in that area.

3 The Land Council's non-native title rights and interests arose from the grant and transfer of the Land to the Land Council by the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales ('the Minister') pursuant to s 36 of the NSW Act on 16 March 1998. Following the transfer of the area that includes Lot 576, the Land Council holds a non-native title interest ' in relation to the whole of the area in relation to which the determination is sought '. It is the holder of an ' an estate in fee simple ... subject to any native title rights and interests existing in relation to the land immediately before the transfer ' (s 36(9) of the NSW Act). As the holder of such an interest, the Land Council is entitled under s 61(1) (Table, clause 2) of the Act to make the present application. Section 40AA of the NSW Act prevents the Land Council from selling, exchanging, leasing, disposing of, mortgaging or otherwise dealing with the Land unless the Land is the subject of an approved determination of native title within the meaning of the Act.

8 A notice of intention to become a party to these proceedings was filed within the three month time period provided for in the s 66 notice by New South Wales Native Title Services Limited ('Native Title Services') and by Mr and Mrs Parkinson. The application by Mr and Mrs Parkinson to be joined to the proceedings was dismissed ( Peter Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, State Minister under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) [2006] FCA 61). Native Title Services was joined as a party on 5 July 2005. On 11 March 2008, an order was made granting leave to that party (whose name had been amended to NTS Corp Limited) to withdraw as a party to the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Western Australia v Sebastian (2008) 248 ALR 61</tocase>
<text>152 The fact that Worimi describes some of the practices, such as hunting and fishing methods, differently from the description given by the other witnesses does not derogate from his evidence. It could well be the case that there were different ways of observing traditions. As was pointed out in Western Australia v Sebastian (2008) 248 ALR 61 at [84], a ' body of laws and customs ' does not require identical practice, nor that each member of a group has precisely the same knowledge or comprehends the laws and customs in precisely the same way.

174 Worimi submits that native title rights and interests may be possessed by individuals or by a group of individuals in circumstances where other members of the same community or society do not possess those or other native title rights and interests in relation to that area (citing De Rose (No 2) at [33], [34] and [44]; Sebastian ). Whether Worimi can establish native title where other members of the Worimi tribe state that there is no native title over the Land is, Worimi submits, not to the point. He says that his individual rights and interests have been recognised, inter alia in De Rose (No 2) at [30], as sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council's case of no native title.

175 Worimi has given evidence. His case as to who holds the relevant native title rights and interests has changed throughout the course of these proceedings. In his affidavit of 18 December 2007, he claims that the native title rights and interests are held by his immediate family. However, in cross-examination and in his affidavit of 1 May 2008, Worimi claimed that all Worimi people hold native title in the Land.

176 As to the assertion that Worimi and his immediate family hold the native title rights and interests, I note that three members of his family, namely his brother Kelvin Dates, his sister Ms Quinlan and his daughter Priscilla Dates do not support his case. However, other members of his family have supported his claimant applications. Worimi says candidly that he would have expected other Worimi women to have knowledge of the laws and customs of which he speaks and accepts that they do not. However, the fact remains that Worimi has only adduced his own evidence of the detail of the beliefs and practices that he says relate to the Land. None of his family members have given evidence of the knowledge of or practice of traditional laws and customs.</text>

<text>9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 '). That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi. I will refer to him as Worimi. Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')). Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application. On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act. For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings.</text>
