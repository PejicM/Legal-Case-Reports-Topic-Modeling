<text>23 In NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1, the Full Court (Black CJ, French, and Selway JJ) said at [60]:
 
 In SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17], Selway referred to the observation by Kirby J in Dranichnikov , at 405, that "[t]he function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances". He also referred to the observation by von Doussa J in SCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 548 that "[n]either the delegate nor the Tribunal is obliged to consider claims that have not been made" (at [16]). Selway J however went on to observe in SGBB (at [17]): 
 
 
 
 'But this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19 th Century pleading.' 
 
 
 
 His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: 
 
 
 
 'The Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it. An asylum claimant does not have to pick the correct Convention "label" to describe his or her plight, but the Tribunal can only deal with the claims actually made.' 
 
 
 
 His Honour, in our view, correctly stated the position when he said at (at [18]): 
 
 
 
 'The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it.'</text>

<tocase>WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/184.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The Full Court further said, at [63]:
 
 It is plain enough, in the light of Dranichnikov, that a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which, if resolved in one way, would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act and thereby a jurisdictional error. It follows that if the Tribunal makes an error of fact in misunderstanding or misconstruing a claim advanced by the applicant and bases its conclusion in whole or in part upon the claim so misunderstood or misconstrued its error is tantamount to a failure to consider the claim and on that basis can constitute jurisdictional error. The same may be true if a claim is raised by the evidence, albeit not expressly by the applicant, and is misunderstood or misconstrued by the Tribunal. Every case must be considered according to its own circumstances. Error of fact, although amounting to misconstruction of an applicant's claim, may be of no consequence to the outcome. It may be "subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which [the] contention rests which has been rejected": Applicant WAEE [ WAEE v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 184] (at [47]). But as the Full Court said in WAEE (at [45]): 
 
 
 
 If the tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 to conduct a review of the decision. This is a matter of substance, not a matter of the form of the tribunal's published reasons for decision.

25 In WAEE , the Full Court said, at [47]:
 
 The inference that the tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point. It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.

26 It may be, as Counsel for the Minister submitted, that the findings and reasons were, and were meant to be, applicable to all of the bases which the appellant had advanced.

27 The fact remains, however, that there is an express and confining reference to ethnicity, both at the start and end of the Tribunal's "Findings and Reasons".</text>
