<tocase>Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510</tocase>
<text>In Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said (544-545 [83]-[85]): 
 "As Guo makes clear, even if the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the events deposed to by an applicant have occurred, the degree of probability of their occurrence or non-occurrence is a relevant matter in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The Tribunal "must take into account the chance that the applicant was so [persecuted] when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution" . However, given the nature of the prosecutor's claim, the Tribunal was entitled &#8212; indeed bound &#8212; to start its inquiry by considering her claim that she had been arrested by government officials for political reasons. 
 ... 
 Once the Tribunal was unable to find that she had been arrested as claimed, her further claims of detention and rape became logically irrelevant. The Tribunal, having found that it could not rely on her evidence of arrest, was not then required to act on her allegations of detention and rape, allegations which were dependent on her claim of being arrested and taken into custody for reasons of political opinion. The Tribunal was not bound therefore to make any express finding as to whether she had been raped. Nor given the nature of her claim and the Tribunal's finding that she was not a credible witness was it required, as it might have been in other circumstances, to determine whether there was a real chance that she had been arrested as she claimed."

<tocase>AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/1533.html</AustLII>
<text>This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533. On 14 November 2008, that Court made an order that the appellant's application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") be dismissed.

The appellant is a national of Egypt. He arrived in Australia on a student visa on 10 May 2005, having left Cairo on 9 May 2005. On 23 June 2005, the appellant made an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa ("protection visa"). On 30 September 2005, a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused the appellant's application for a protection visa. On 2 November 2005, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision. On 28 January 2006, the Tribunal decided to affirm the delegate's decision not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal. By consent, the Federal Magistrates Court issued constitutional writs setting aside the Tribunal's decision and it remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.

On 5 February 2008, the Tribunal (differently constituted) once again decided to affirm the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant again made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal and it is the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court on that application which is the subject of the appeal to this Court.</text>

<tocase>Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant submits that the approach of the Tribunal member involved jurisdictional error and that the federal magistrate erred in law in failing to so conclude. He referred to the well-known passage in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 (" Dranichnikov ") (at 394 [26]): 
 "At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps. First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."

The appellant submits that the Tribunal member failed to determine at the outset whether the following particular social groups, or one of them, existed for the purposes of the Convention: 
(a) a family of Coptic Christians with prominent members that proselytise Muslims in Egypt; and
 
(b) Coptic Christian proselytisers of Muslims in Egypt.

The Tribunal member rejected the suggestion that merely being a Coptic Christian could give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution and, as I understand it, it is not suggested that jurisdictional error arose in relation to that conclusion. The Tribunal member reached the same conclusion after he added to the appellant's status as a Coptic Christian the activities of his grandfather and uncle. The Tribunal member also rejected the appellant's account of his proselytising activities. As the Tribunal member said, he rejected "various constituent details of [the appellant's] account" and he was not satisfied that the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community.

As far as the two particular social groups set out in [45] above and on the assumption in relation to the group identified in (a) that the appellant is one of the prominent proselytisers, the Tribunal member approached the matter by going straight to the second question, namely, whether the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. He found that he was not. In those circumstances, it was not necessary for the Tribunal member to formulate and consider a precise social group because an element of each formulation is that the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. The Tribunal member did make a reference to whether proselytisers of Muslims in local Christian communities could face persecution by reason of those activities, but he did not directly address the first question identified by Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov . Nevertheless, for the reasons I have given, that did not lead to jurisdictional error.

It is not clear to me whether the appellant is submitting that the Tribunal member failed to address, as an alternative to his principal claim, a claim that he feared persecution not as a result of his own activities, but as a result of his membership of his family and the activities of his grandfather and uncle. If he is making that submission, I would reject it because I think the Tribunal did address that possibility. The appellant's own claim that his problems did not begin until 2003-2004 meant either that his family was not a relevant particular social group or, in the circumstances, membership of it did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution.

The second ground of appeal is linked to the first. It is that the federal magistrate erred in not concluding that the Tribunal member erred by addressing the wrong question in that the Tribunal member concluded that the appellant had not been drawn into the conflict involving his uncle and that he was not significantly affected by his grandfather's situation or his uncle's situation. I do not think the Tribunal member erred in approaching the matter in that way. He was saying no more than that the appellant's membership of his family, which included his grandfather and uncle, did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. That was a finding open to the Tribunal member on the evidence.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/22.html</AustLII>
<text>The "what if I am wrong test" was discussed by Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 576. 
 "It is true that, in determining whether there is a real chance that an event will occur or will occur for a particular reason, the degree of probability that similar events have or have not occurred or have or have not occurred for particular reasons in the past is relevant in determining the chance that the event or the reason will occur in the future. If, for example, a Tribunal finds that it is only slightly more probable than not that an applicant has not been punished for a Convention reason, it must take into account the chance that the applicant was so punished when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution. 

 
 In the present case, however, the Tribunal appears to have had no real doubt that its findings both as to the past and the future were correct. That is, the Tribunal appears to have taken the view that the probability of error in its findings was insignificant. Once the Tribunal reached that conclusion, a finding that nevertheless Mr Guo had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason would have been irrational. Given its apparent confidence in its conclusions, the Tribunal was not then bound to consider whether its findings might be wrong."

In Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said (544-545 [83]-[85]): 
 "As Guo makes clear, even if the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the events deposed to by an applicant have occurred, the degree of probability of their occurrence or non-occurrence is a relevant matter in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The Tribunal "must take into account the chance that the applicant was so [persecuted] when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution" . However, given the nature of the prosecutor's claim, the Tribunal was entitled &#8212; indeed bound &#8212; to start its inquiry by considering her claim that she had been arrested by government officials for political reasons.

<tocase>N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21</tocase>
<text>I refer also to N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21 at 34-35 [43]-[49].

In my opinion, there are two answers to the appellant's submission. The first is that the Tribunal member did not, it seems to me, have any real doubt about his conclusions. He found that, even making allowance for the appellant's medical condition, he was not a witness of truth. He made the point on a number of occasions in the course of his reasons that he did not believe the appellant's account of events and that he found particular claims made by the appellant to be inconsistent and implausible. The second answer to the appellant's submission is that the Tribunal member did address the ultimate questions of whether the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community and whether he faced a real chance of persecution in Egypt (see [19] and [22]).

The second submission in relation to grounds three and four is that it is said that the Tribunal member's reasoning in the following passage is illogical: 
 "The Tribunal accepts as genuine the death certificate pertaining to the Applicant's father. The Tribunal accepts that the Applicant's father died at home at 49 years from a 'brain haemorrhage' or stroke. The Tribunal is prepared to accept in principle that a person could die hours after a serious beating from internal bleeding, for example, in the head or in the torso. On the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not accept the claim that the Applicant's father died as a result of police brutality or that he was detained and mistreated by the police shortly before dying. On the evidence before the Tribunal, the claimed circumstances of the Applicant's father's death are concocted. This is to a significant extent because the Tribunal does not accept as factual the key events that led to the Applicant going into internal exile, or the circumstances in which he returned to the farm, or the facts about how he obtained his passport. The Tribunal does not accept the Applicant's claim that the authorities adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating his father to get to or at him, the Applicant, or to extract information about him. The Tribunal also finds that in view of the Applicant's overall credibility problems up to this point, it does not accept that the authorities, supposedly acting in the interests of violently angered fundamentalists, adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating the Applicant's father to punish him for his own actions or to deter him from similar actions in the future."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/328.html</AustLII>
<text>In connection with this submission, reference was made to NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 (" NADH ") and, in particular, to Allsop J (with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed) at 286-287 [129]-[136].

I do not think that there is anything illogical in the Tribunal member's reasoning. In essence, the conclusion is reached that the story is concocted by the appellant because key elements of his account cannot be accepted.

The fifth ground of appeal is not pressed by the appellant.

Secondly, the appellant submitted that the conduct of the review and the findings made by the Tribunal member should lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. The appellant referred to NADH at 266-285 [10]-[125], a case in which the Full Court of this Court held that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. A singular feature of that case was that a number of letters and documents were in effect put to one side by the Tribunal member as not establishing any fact without any real reasons being given for adopting that course. For example, a number of letters were dismissed by the Tribunal member as being of no weight on the grounds that they were vague or did not establish certain matters without any real reasons being given for those conclusions.</text>

<text>First, the appellant submitted that the conduct of the review and the findings made by the Tribunal member should lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal did not conduct the review required by the Act. The appellant referred to NAQS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1137 ; (2003) 77 ALD 424 , a case in which Hill J reached the conclusion that the Tribunal had not conducted the review required by the Act. Without being exhaustive, features of that case which led to that conclusion were a refusal by the Tribunal member to allow the applicant to call a witness, the Tribunal member acting in a rude manner and the Tribunal member cutting the applicant off in the course of his answers and refusing to hear explanations from the applicant.</text>
