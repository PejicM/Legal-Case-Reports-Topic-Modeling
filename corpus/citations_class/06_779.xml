<tocase>Comcare Australia v Mathieson (2004) 79 ALD 518</tocase>
<text>37 It is important when considering the extent of the Tribunal's obligations under s 43 to have regard to the words of the section. The primary obligation imposed on the Tribunal by the section is to 'give reasons ... for its decision'. They must include but are not limited to its findings on material questions of fact and reference to the evidence on which those findings are based. It must be possible '... to discern from the reasons given the actual reasoning process adopted ...' Comcare Australia v Mathieson (2004) 79 ALD 518 at [61] per Weinberg J.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The grounds of appeal, as set out in the notice, are as follows: 
 
 
 '4.1 The Tribunal erred in law in that, by failing to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact, a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and the reasons for: 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.1.1 its decision that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months (paragraph 55); 
 4.1.2 the basis on which the Tribunal reconciled that decision with the finding (paragraph 54) that Mr Homewood had available assets that would realise between $48,000 and $58,000 [sic] ; and 
 4.1.3 the Tribunal's decision that the appropriate part of the compensation payment received by Mr Homewood that should be treated as not having been made was the part that would lead to the preclusion period ending on 1 July 2006 instead of 18 October 2022 (paragraph 56) 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its decision, in contravention of the requirements of s 43(2) and (2B) of the AAT Act.'

14 The Tribunal commenced its reasons by noting the agreement by the parties that the date of the accident, 3 February 1993, the amount of the compensation payment, $1,250,000, and the calculation of the preclusion period, 3 February 1993 to 18 October 2022, were not in dispute. It then said (at [4]): 
 
 'The issue in contention was whether special circumstances existed that would make it appropriate to treat the compensation payment either in whole or part as not having been made.'

15 The Tribunal reviewed Mr Homewood's evidence. It dealt with that evidence largely by setting out his responses to various documentary exhibits put to him. The exhibits were not always identified with clarity.

38 The present case is not about a failure on the part of the Tribunal to include in its reasons the findings on material questions of fact which it has made. Nor is it a complaint that the Tribunal has failed to refer to the evidence on which those findings were based. Many of the reported cases involve claims of that kind of failure see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 (Gleeson J), 338 (Gaudron J), 346 (McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) cf 367 (Kirby J).</text>

<tocase>Brackenreg v Comcare Australia (1995) 56 FCR 335</tocase>
<text>39 As Sheppard J said in Brackenreg v Comcare Australia (1995) 56 FCR 335 (at 349):
 
 'Although the obligations to state the findings of fact and the evidence upon which those findings were based are related to the obligation to give reasons, they are independent and separate obligations.' 
 

That statement neatly identifies what might be called the tripartite nature of the obligation under s 43. It is an obligation: 

(i) to give reasons; 
(ii) to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact; 
 
 (iii) to include in its reasons reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings are based. 


 Brackenreg was a case in which the Tribunal was found not to have discharged its duty to refer to the evidence on which its findings of fact were made at 352. In Dixon v Repatriation Commission (1999) 29 AAR 235, Wilcox J said of s 43 that it required (at [14])
 
 
 '... findings, on the substantial issues raised by the case, in terms sufficiently explicit to enable the parties to understand why the decision went the way it did... The question always is whether the decision maker has revealed his or her findings and conclusions.'

<tocase>Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313</tocase>
<text>45 The Tribunal's obligation is to give its reasons for its decision in the sense explained earlier. In so doing it is not required to express itself with the precision that might be required of a court of law. As Morling and Wilcox JJ said in Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313 (at 328): 
 
 'The tribunal is an administrative body and, whilst errors of law made by it are susceptible to correction by this court, its decisions should not be too closely scrutinised for the purpose of searching for errors of law in what may be imprecise language.' 
 

In my opinion, the Tribunal made a finding of fact that within six months Mr Homewood would be destitute (absent the disability support pension). It had regard to his asset position in coming to that conclusion. The complaint that it has not adequately disclosed its reasons for so concluding amounts to little more than a complaint about its findings of fact.

46 The Secretary accepted, by reference to [44] of the Tribunal's reasons, that the amount available for Mr Homewood's support could arguably be fixed at a lower range of between $20,000 and $30,000. That is not a reading of the Tribunal's reasons which is particularly generous to Mr Homewood. It is to be noted that the assets giving rise to those figures are comprised of 'coin collections and other collectibles', '20 boxes of items' 'DVDs ...; a motor vehicle worth less than $5,000'.

47 Having regard to the nature of the assets to which the Tribunal adverted in its reasons, its finding that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months was open to it. That finding formed a base, in principle, for the exercise of the discretion under s 1184K(1) of the Act. The way in which it approached the exercise of that discretion was adequately explained by reference to its finding of fact. While it may be argued that a more elaborate and principled approach by reference to the rules governing the fixing of preclusion periods under the Act would have been preferable, that is not the basis upon which the Tribunal's decision is attacked in this case. It is attacked only on the basis that it has failed to give adequate reasons. In my opinion that challenge is not made out and the application should be dismissed.

48 For the preceding reasons the application is dismissed. The applicant will be required to pay the respondent's costs. 
 

 I certify that the preceding forty eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
