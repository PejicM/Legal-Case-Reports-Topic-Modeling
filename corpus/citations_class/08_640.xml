<text>82 The danger of hindsight was also referred to by Lord Diplock in Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd v Mills-Rockley (Electronics) Ltd [1972] RPC 346 at 362 (and approved by the High Court in Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 194 ALR 485 at 491) in these terms:
 
 'Once an invention has been made it is generally possible to postulate a combination of steps by which the inventor might have arrived at the invention that he claims in his specification if he started from something that was already known. But it is only because the invention has been made and has proved successful that it is possible to postulate from what starting point and by what particular combination of steps the inventor could have arrived at his invention. It may be that taken in isolation none of the steps which it is now possible to postulate, if taken in isolation, appears to call for any inventive ingenuity. It is improbable that this reconstruction a posteriori represents the mental process by which the inventor in fact arrived at his invention, but, even if it were, inventive ingenuity lay in perceiving that the final result which it was the object of the inventor to achieve was attainable from the particular starting point and in his selection of the particular combination of steps which would lead to that result.</text>

<text>48 Having regard to the terms of the claims in suit and to the principles of construction set out in the authorities (see Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 66 ; (2001) 201 CLR 1 at 16; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 475-476; Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austral Ship Sales Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 257 at 263-264), I am persuaded that for the wear assembly to work in a practical manner and withstand the forces brought to play on it, it would be impractical to require the boss to be attached only to the front face or bevelled ramp.

<tocase>Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/58.html</AustLII>
<text>88 The respondents say there was a lack of fair basis in the present case because the specifications of the patents in suit do not provide real and reasonably clear disclosure of the invention. The relevant principles as to fair basis were set out in Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at 294ff.

89 I do not accept this submission of the respondents. For reasons given above, I consider the disclosure is not limited to a rigid lock which operates as a "shear" member. Rather, it includes a lock with an adjustment assembly which in fact operates in the way claimed. Accordingly, the specification provides a sufficient disclosure for the adjustment assembly in the terms of the claim.

90 I direct the parties to consult with a view to agreeing upon and sending to my Associate in chambers Short Minutes of Order giving effect to the above reasons. If the parties are unable to agree, they are to send to my Associate in chambers competing Short Minutes of Order with brief reasons.</text>

<tocase>Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited (No. 2) [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/21.html</AustLII>
<text>68 The issue of obviousness which arises in this case is whether a hypothetical person skilled in the relevant art in light of the common general knowledge as at 6 November 1995 would have regarded it as obvious, in the production of an improved wear assembly, to utilise a screw as a means of eliminating looseness in the wear assembly and thereby arrive at the claimed invention in Jones III: see s 7(2) of the Act ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited (No. 2) [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 at 231. When addressing this question, the Court must be careful not to substitute its own deduction or perception for that of the hypothetical person. Furthermore, as the High Court has stated on several occasions, "[a] scintilla of invention remains sufficient in Australian law to support the validity of a patent": see Lockwood 235 ALR at 217 and cases cited therein.

69 The applicants contend that the person skilled in the relevant art in this case is someone who works in the earthmoving industries who would be involved in the design and manufacture of wear assemblies and therefore would be familiar with factors relevant to their design and development. It is said by the applicants that Professor Wightley is not a person skilled in the relevant art because he had no experience in the design, operation or manufacture of wear assemblies attached specifically to excavators.

70 The respondents' contention is that only Professor Wightley and Messrs Meyers, Ashworth and McClanahan are persons skilled in the relevant art. It is said that Professor Wightley is a mechanical engineer with extensive experience in design and manufacture of replacement wear parts for use in the mining industry generally; Mr Meyers is a mechanical engineer with experience in the design, manufacture, sale and maintenance of replaceable wear parts for excavators; and Messrs Ashworth and McClanahan are relevantly skilled mechanical engineers. On the other hand, say the respondents, Mr Alden, the expert called by the applicants, is a structural engineer, which means he is not skilled in the relevant art. In addition, the respondents argue that the only witness called by the applicants on the issue of obviousness was Mr McClanahan (the co-inventor of the patents), and that the evidence called by the respondents in relation to this point was therefore not directly challenged by any qualified expert.

71 In my opinion, Professor Wightley and the other mechanical engineers whose evidence was adduced by the respondents have sufficient expertise to express the opinions as persons skilled in the art. However, for reasons given below, I do not accept Professor Wightley's evidence and the respondents' submission that the solution provided by the invention in Jones II and Jones III was obvious.

72 The applicants say that the invention in this case is an improved wear assembly which is constituted by the combination of elements set out in claims 1 and 51 of Jones II and claim 1 of Jones III. Each of these claims in suit, it is said, involves a combination of elements in a way that constitutes a new inventive thing, despite the fact that each of the elements (other than the lock adjustment assembly) was contained in the Toplok shroud, which the applicants' properly acknowledged formed part of the common general knowledge. In simpler terms, the new combination achieved by the patents in this case provided a new benefit beyond what had previously been provided, and was therefore inventive.

73 The applicants submit that the invention the subject of Jones II and Jones III was based on perceptions that:
 
&#8226; the Toplok shroud provided a good foundation upon which to develop an improved wear assembly that could serve not only as a shroud but also as an adapter;
 
&#8226; the forces to which an adapter may be exposed could produce looseness in mounting of the wear assembly to a Toplok style of mounting; and
 
&#8226; this looseness could be overcome by an adjustment assembly that moved the relative positions of the bearing surfaces of the Toplok style lock so as to pull the wear assembly over the mount.

74 The applicants' argument is that the use of this type of adapter with a Toplok style of mounting was not part of the common general knowledge at the relevant date. Furthermore, the applicants say that, since there were at the relevant date many wear assemblies available to be used as the starting point to develop an improved assembly which overcame looseness between the wear member and the boss, the use of Toplok as the starting point was not required by any design principle, and was therefore not obvious. Indeed, as Professor Wightley acknowledged in cross-examination, even if an inventor were confined to the Toplok shroud as a starting point, there were several other locking methods known which may have been used instead of the method ultimately used in the invention. One such alternative method was the use of two piece pins, wedges and spools to take up any looseness in the wear assembly.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/19.html</AustLII>
<text>81 The dangers inherent in drawing conclusions with the benefit of hindsight have been emphasised in the authorities. As Aickin J pointed out in Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 242:
 
 '... subsequent analysis of an invention "the dissection of the invention" is not often helpful in resolving the question of obviousness. It has been criticized as being a mistaken approach, see Blanco White, Patents for Inventions , 4 th ed. (1974), at par.4-214. This matter was also discussed by Menzies J in Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd. v M.W.A. Holdings Pty. Ltd. where he commented on the undesirability of analysis by hindsight because once one sees an invention it may very often appear very simple and one may then wonder why no one previously had thought of so simple an improvement device.'</text>
