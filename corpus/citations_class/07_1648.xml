<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/23.html</AustLII>
<text>11 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 at 211, after referring to ss 175 and 177 and to the judgment of Dixon J in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 at 615, Deane and Gaudron JJ said:
 
 "That approach should, in our view, be applied to the construction of s 175 of the Act. The result of its application is that s 175's protection from invalidity is applicable only if the purported 'assessment' (i) is 'a bona fide attempt' by the Commissioner or other authorised officer to exercise powers conferred by the Act , (ii) 'relates to the subject matter' of the Act and (iii) 'is reasonably capable of reference to' those powers. If a purported 'assessment' does not satisfy those three requirements, the protection of s 175 will be unavailable and the purported 'assessment' will be invalid."</text>

<tocase>Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 2000 ATC 4,247</tocase>
<text>12 In Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 2000 ATC 4,247 at [9], Kenny J said:
 
 "It follows [from Richard Walter] that uncertainty on the Deputy Commissioner's part as to the facts relevant to the exercise of his power of assessment does not evidence an absence of bona fides in the Hickman sense. 
 ... 
 If, however, the Deputy Commissioner formed the view that there was no substantial possibility that an amount was part of the assessable income of a taxpayer, then the Commissioner could not bona fide assess that taxpayer as liable to tax in respect of that income."

24 The foregoing description of the audit process shows that once apprised by the Police of the applicant's arrest with $620,000 cash in his possession, the Commissioner proceeded in a methodical way to collect information about the applicant's financial affairs in order to determine whether any amounts should be included in his taxable income. As it turned out, two items were wrongly included in that income in the 2002 year. As I have said, the applicant successfully objected to that inclusion. But the fact that the Commissioner later accepted that he had erred in including these amounts does not establish that the assessment that contained them was not a bona fide attempt to assess the applicant's income. The applicant has not persuaded me that the Commissioner knew there was no substantial possibility that the amount he assessed was part of his assessable income. See the passage from Briglia set out at [12]. It may well be that the Commissioner was uncertain as to whether all the amounts he in fact included were truly income of the applicant, but that uncertainty does not show the absence of a bona fide attempt, as is pointed out in Futuris Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] ATC 4600 at [44].

37 Other cases that have found a lack of a bona fide attempt are in marked contrast to the present. In Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 72 FCR 175 at 188 the Full Court said:
 
 "Not only did the Commissioner not make any genuine attempt to ascertain the sale value of particular goods under each of the relevant Assessment Acts, but he also determined a sale value and purported to create a liability for sales tax upon facts which he knew were wrong. 
 ... 
 An assessment on facts known by the Commissioner to be untrue is of its nature unfair and oppressive." 
 

In the present case the Commissioner did not act upon any facts which he knew to be wrong. It is true that he did not know all the facts but, doing the best he could on the facts he did know, he made assessments. That they did not wholly survive review by the Tribunal does not establish the lack of a bona fide attempt: Madden at 396 and Briglia at [9].</text>

<tocase>Futuris Corporation Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] ATC 4600</tocase>
<text>24 The foregoing description of the audit process shows that once apprised by the Police of the applicant's arrest with $620,000 cash in his possession, the Commissioner proceeded in a methodical way to collect information about the applicant's financial affairs in order to determine whether any amounts should be included in his taxable income.

38 Futuris is also distinguishable. There the Commissioner knew, at the time he issued the assessment, that the taxpayer's taxable income could be no greater than $169 million, yet he issued it for a taxable income of $188 million.</text>

<tocase>Madden v Madden (1996) 65 FCR 354</tocase>
<text>34 That the Commissioner's use of the garnishee process to prevent the return of the money to the applicant does not demonstrate the absence of a bona fide attempt is supported by the Full Court's decision in Madden v Madden (1996) 65 FCR 354. In that case the taxpayer was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply heroin. Thereupon the Commissioner assessed him to income tax on the sale value of the heroin. The sale value had been notified to the Commissioner by the police. The taxpayer's application to have the assessment set aside on the ground that it was not made bona fide was dismissed. Foster J, with whom Sheppard J agreed, said at 395:
 
 "The only significant question, in my view, is whether it could be argued that he made no assessment at all, in that he acted in bad faith and for the ulterior purpose of using his powers under s 218 of the Tax Act to require payment to him of the amount of money held by the police." 
 

(I interpolate that s 218 is the predecessor of s 260-5). Foster J continued:
 
 "The material adduced shows that the Commissioner was minded to take possession of this money in circumstances of urgency in that, if swift action were not taken, the money would pass from the possession of the police and would, in all probability, become irrecoverable. It may be said, then, that evidence has been adduced showing that the Commissioner was motivated, in raising the assessment, by a desire to take possession of the money. 
 ... 
 As I see it, the appellant's contention amounts really to this. He alleges that the assessment was invalid because it was issued by the Commissioner in abuse of his power to assess under s 167, in that it was not a bona fide attempt to assess the amount upon which tax should be levied but was a mere device to enable the issue of the s 218 notice .... 
 
 In the first place, I am unable to attribute any significance to the fact that the assessment was issued in conjunction with and motivated by a desire to take advantage of s 218. There is sufficient indication of urgency in the situation to warrant the steps that were taken. In my opinion, the s 218 connection is a purely neutral fact in the determination of whether the assessment itself was invalid."

37 Other cases that have found a lack of a bona fide attempt are in marked contrast to the present. In Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 72 FCR 175 at 188 the Full Court said:
 
 "Not only did the Commissioner not make any genuine attempt to ascertain the sale value of particular goods under each of the relevant Assessment Acts, but he also determined a sale value and purported to create a liability for sales tax upon facts which he knew were wrong. 
 ...

<tocase>R v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (WA); Ex parte Briggs (1986) 12 FCR 301</tocase>
<text>35 His Honour went on at 396 to say that the Commissioner had available to him positive information as to the value of the heroin dealing undertaken by the taxpayer in the relevant income year. It was a substantial sum, and was adequate to provide a foundation for a default assessment in the circumstance in which the assessment needed to be issued. He concluded that conformably with the principles in R v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (WA); Ex parte Briggs (1987) 14 FCR 249, the Commissioner was entitled to use the figure provided as a basis for the assessment. It "could well be erroneous, but it was nevertheless bona fide".

36 I do not attribute any significance to the sending of the garnishee notice to the applicant's former address. I do not accept the applicant's contention that the person who sent the copy notice to the wrong address did so in order that the applicant would not know it had been served on the Police. Mr Saunders, who knew of the changed address, was on leave at the crucial time, and the officer who acted in his absence was probably unaware of the change.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The applicant submitted that the issues in the case were within the knowledge of the taxation officers and that their failure to give evidence gave rise to the inference that their evidence would not have assisted the Commissioner. He relied on Kordan Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1807 at [47] to [51] and Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225-229. This reliance on Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 is misplaced. As the Court said in that case at [48]:
 
 "the rule, however expressed, does not permit an inference to be drawn by reason of the failure of the other side to call a witness where that inference is not otherwise open. Put another way, the failure to call evidence does not provide positive evidence, nor does it fill up any gap in the evidence." 
 

In Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121 at 143 Gleeson CJ and McHugh J approved a passage from the 6 th Australian edition of Cross on Evidence :
 
 "The rule [in Jones v Dunkel] only applies where a party is 'required to explain or contradict' something. What a party is required to explain or contradict depends on the issues in the case as thrown up in the pleadings and by the course of evidence in the case. No inference can be drawn unless evidence is given of facts 'requiring an answer'." 
 

Their Honours went on:
 
 "A Jones v Dunkel inference can only make certain evidence more probable. It 'cannot be used to make up any deficiency of evidence': Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 312 per Menzies J."
