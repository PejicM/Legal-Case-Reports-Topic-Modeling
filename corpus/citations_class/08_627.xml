<tocase>Re South African Supply and Cold Storage (1904) 2 Ch 268</tocase>
<text>13 The scheme is a scheme for the reconstruction of the company. It passes the test set out by Buckley J in Re South African Supply and Cold Storage (1904) 2 Ch 268 at 286. The undertaking is being transferred to persons who are not outsiders so that substantially the same business will be carried on by substantially the same persons who previously conducted the business.

14 I have been provided with a helpful written outline of pSivida Ltd's submissions. In accordance with the practice usually followed, I will mark the outline of submissions as MFI 1, but will not make any further reference to them in these reasons.

15 I am satisfied that I should make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order which I have now signed and dated and placed with the Court papers.

 I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.
