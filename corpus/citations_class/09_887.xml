<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/539.html</AustLII>
<text>On 22 May 2009, for reasons which I then gave, I granted certain interlocutory injunctive relief on the application of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) - Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those of 22 May 2009.

The interlocutory relief granted on 22 May 2009 was not as extensive as the ACMA had sought, but that was because of comprehensive undertakings which were then proffered to the Court. On that day, I also made directions for the further conduct of the proceedings. Those directions included the following: The first respondent provide a response to the applicant's request for particulars dated 15 May 2009 on or before 11 June 2009. The first respondent provide to the applicant a full electronic copy of that database referred to in paragraph 5 of the first respondent's discovery list filed 31 March 2009, or alternatively access to that database for the purposes of the applicant creating an electronic copy, on and from not later than 11 June 2009.

The first respondent file and serve an amended discovery list by 11 June 2009, which list: 
(1) identifies, as fully and accurately as possible, the documents previously held by the first respondent, which it no longer holds, and what became of them;
 
(2) identifies whether each such document is in its power or control and the steps it has taken to obtain documents that are within its power or control;
 
(3) lists, to the extent they are within the discovery categories required of the first respondent, documents in relation to the employment of Ms Teresa Posella;
 
(4) incorporates in the response to item 5 of the said discovery categories, production of any database in relation to the premium telephone number 19910007.</text>

<tocase>Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27</tocase>
<text>Mr Salcedo states that he and his colleagues did not wish to appear without the services of a lawyer but could not afford that. Like any other individual party, each of the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents is entitled to represent himself if he chooses. None of them have indicated an active interest in so doing or even that they are actively seeking alternative legal representation. The preference voiced by Mr Salcedo is not a basis for the ignoring of the progression of a case in the Court in accordance with the Court's directions. That case management considerations are relevant to the exercise of discretions in respect of matters of practice and procedure arising under the rules of court was recently emphasised by the High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 at [30].

Mr Salcedo also makes reference to negotiations having occurred with the ACMA in relation to the proceedings and attaches, without the permission of the AGS, a copy of a "without prejudice" letter written by the AGS in that regard. That attachment should not have occurred.

The ACMA, by the AGS, does not object to the marking of the letter as an exhibit but with the proviso that the attachment should not be available for general searching. That seems to me the appropriate course to take in respect of it. I shall give directions accordingly.</text>

<text>Further, the Court is alternatively empowered to give judgment or make any other order against the respondent concerned. In other words, there is no requirement that evidence be adduced by the parties seeking default judgment in respect of the matters pleaded in the statement of claim. Instead, the statement of claim must be scrutinised to see whether it discloses a cause of action in law in respect of the relief sought. In Humphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd (ACN 104 808 853) (2008) IPR 144 at 146, [6] to [9], I concluded that this was the effect of the rule. I shall not repeat what is there stated.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665</tocase>
<text>That is not to say that the receipt of evidence is precluded on an application for default judgment under O 35A. Prior authority establishes that additional evidence consistent with a party's case as pleaded in the statement of claim may be considered with respect to the relief sought: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 (Kiefel J (affirmed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 161 FCR 513) (Dataline).

In Dataline , Kiefel J also noted of O 35A that:

The statement of claim alleges numerous contraventions of s 16(1) and s 16(9) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act). It further alleges contraventions by the First and Second Respondents of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) with the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents being alleged to be parties to these corporate contraventions. Albeit at the risk of over-generalisation, the conduct alleged may be summarised as the deceptive use of fabricated profiles on dating websites in order to obtain mobile telephone numbers for the purpose of sending or causing to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages to the unsuspecting telephone account holders. Yet, further conduct alleged involves the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages which purport to supply a "single club" or "fantasy chat" service to unsuspecting telephone account holders.

So far as the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents are concerned, I am satisfied that the statement of claim alleges contraventions known to law of the Spam Act and the Trade Practices Act and which enliven the Court's jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief. I am further satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is not merely a bland recitation of statutory prohibitions but rather has been framed with sufficient precision to enable the Respondents concerned to identify the conduct which is the subject of restraint and so as to permit ready identification of an event of default. The declarations sought are in these terms:
