<tocase>Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/30.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The application was remitted to this Court pursuant to orders made by Gaudron J following the delivery of judgment in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601.

4 By letter dated 12 November 2004, the District Registrar of this Court notified the applicant that the Court proposed to consider whether there was an arguable case on the basis of the written material that the applicant had given to the Court and without any oral hearing. The applicant was invited to file written submissions on the question of whether the Court should make an order nisi . On 7 December 2004, the applicant filed an amended application under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), however, he has not filed any written submissions.

5 I propose to deal with this application on the papers.

18 This claim in form may be prima facie capable of attracting relief under the second limb of the Muin ratio decidendi, that is, that the applicant was misled into thinking that favourable country information had been considered by the Tribunal when in fact it had not. However, the material contained in the draft order nisi and the affidavit in support merely amounts to a pleading or assertion of the right to relief. There are no particulars or evidence of facts that would support the grant of the relief claimed. None of the country information is identified. For orders requiring the respondent to show cause why final relief should not be granted, the applicant must provide material showing that there is at least an arguable case for the grant of the final relief claimed.

19 On the material before me, the applicant has not made out an arguable case that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. The application for an order nisi should therefore be dismissed with costs.
 

 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.

<text>14 Subsection 424A(3)(b) provides that s 424A does not apply to information "that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application". In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27, a Full Court held that information to which ss 424A(3)(b) refers is information given by an applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application for review and not to information given on the original application for a protection visa.</text>

<text>15 The reference to "information" in s 424A does not encompass a failure to mention a matter to the Tribunal. An observation that an applicant failed to refer to a particular matter may constitute no more than an aspect of the Tribunal's reasoning concerning a deficiency in his evidence. In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [24], Finn and Stone JJ commented on the term "information":
 
 " ... the word does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps."
