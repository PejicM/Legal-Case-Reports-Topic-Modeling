<tocase>Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Limited (2005) 65 IPR 86</tocase>
<text>41 The principles of construction of a patent specification are well-settled. The general approach is summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Limited (2005) 65 IPR 86 at [67] and [68]. It is not necessary to repeat the Full Court's comments here.

118 In the event that I am incorrect and the document does anticipate all the integers of Claims 7 and 18, the issue is whether the novelty destroying disclosure was made "publicly available" before the priority date: s 7(1) of the Act . NSI bears the onus of establishing that the document was made publicly available: see Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 86 at 118. If this is established, then, in order to uphold the validity of the patent, the University must establish that it did not consent to the disclosure of the document: s 24(1)(b) of the Act . In this case, I am satisfied that the document was not made publicly available and also that the University did not consent to it being publicly disclosed.</text>

<tocase>Catnic Components Ltd v Hiller and Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183</tocase>
<text>43 It is, however, necessary to guard against an unduly strict literal approach since, in some circumstances, such an approach may be inappropriate. By way of illustration, see Catnic Components Ltd v Hiller and Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 at 242 per Lord Diplock. That case illustrates circumstances in which the strict literal approach was considered by the House of Lords to be inappropriate.

44 With these principles in mind, I turn now to the construction of the claims in the present case.

45 The construction question in the present case focuses on Claim 7 of the Complex Patent. As discussed above, Claim 7 is a claim for a complex and not a product or a method for a product. It claims a monopoly for: 
 
 
 "(7) A stable soluble alkaline calcium phosphate complex, which has been formed at a pH greater than 7, including phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof wherein the said phosphopeptide includes the amino acid sequence Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Glu-Glu."

46 Professor Dawes explains Claim 7 in this way. He points out that a "complex" is a combination of two or more components in which there is an interaction between the components. The calcium phosphate complex in this claim is alkaline. This means that, as it exists, it has a pH of more than 7. There is an additional integer that the calcium phosphate must be formed at a pH greater than 7. This goes to the manufacture of the complex, which must retain a pH greater than 7 after creation and when examined. The phosphopeptide referred to is a chain of amino acids which has phosphorylated amino acids. The phosphopeptides stabilise calcium phosphate in a non-crystalline form by inhibiting it from converting into a crystalline form and precipitating out of solution. Amorphous calcium phosphate is usually not stable as it tends to convert to crystalline forms of calcium phosphate. Amorphous calcium phosphate is bio-available in that it can dissolve and release calcium and phosphate for depositing on teeth. The calcium and phosphate ions, due to their size, can diffuse through surface enamel over a sub-surface caries lesion. The pores on the surface enamel are larger than the charged ions and will not impede the diffusion of calcium or phosphate ions through the enamel. By contrast, crystalline forms of calcium phosphate present in the mouth under normal oral conditions cannot diffuse into the teeth, because the crystals are too large to diffuse through the pores in the enamel. These forms of calcium phosphate are therefore not bio-available.

47 The case for NSI is that, as a matter of language, the subject of the claim is the "complex" referred to, which is defined in the claim. NSI says that the complex is required to be "stable", "soluble", "alkaline", to "include calcium phosphate" - which is "formed at a pH greater than 7" - and to "include phosphopeptide which stabilises amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof".

48 In my view, the last descriptor referred to by NSI does not accurately reflect Claim 7. The final element of Claim 7 refers to phosphopeptide stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate or a derivative thereof. It is the stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate or derivative which is included and not merely the phosphopeptide. The expression is a composite.

49 NSI also submits that the phosphopeptide must include the Cluster Sequence. NSI says that it is common general knowledge among relevant addressees that phosphopeptides containing the amino acid Cluster Sequence are derived from proteins and, in particular, caseins.</text>

<tocase>Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/23.html</AustLII>
<text>72 The University's case on infringement does not depend on any principles of purposive construction. Instead, the University claims that each of the integers of Claim 7 are literally present, in combination, in each of the NSI Products. The question of infringement is largely determined by reference to the proper construction of the claim: see Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 246 per Gibbs J.

73 NSI says that, if the University's construction of Claim 7 is correct, the NSI Products do not infringe the claim because there is no evidence that they include the relevant form of amorphous calcium phosphate, namely, stable, soluble and alkaline calcium phosphate. On the other hand, NSI says that, if its construction of Claim 7 is correct, the NSI Products do not infringe the claim because the complexes are not formed by using phosphopeptides deliberately extracted, isolated and purified. Further, to the extent that the phosphopeptides are created after formation of a complex of casein, calcium and phosphate, they are not formed by the phosphopeptide stabilising amorphous calcium phosphate as required by Claim 7.

74 It is therefore necessary to consider the evidence.

91 This test calls for consideration of whether the prior disclosure incorporates all of the integers of any of the claims: see Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 220 at [128] - [152] . That is, the prior disclosure must reveal the totality of the invention and the antecedent information and must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would perceive, understand and be able to practically apply the invention without needing to do experiments or obtain further information before the invention can be made useful: see Hill v Evans (1862) 4 De GF &amp; J 288 per Lord Westbury LC; Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge &amp; Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 261 per Stephen and Mason JJ. In other words, the principal issue is whether the content and effect of the claimed anticipation is sufficient to destroy the element of novelty in the invention: see Pfizer-Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly &amp; Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [311] - [324] .

209 Section 40 of the Act requires that a complete specification must be clear, succinct and fairly based on the matter described in the specification. NSI submits that the Complex Patent specification does not comply with these requirements. In Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [69] , the High Court formulated the relevant question as being whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the invention is broadly or in a general sense described in the body of the specification. Another way that the question can be posed is to ask whether the claim travels beyond the disclosure in the specification: Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 240 per Barwick CJ.</text>

What matters is what is taught by the material: Evans Medical Ltd's Patent [1998] RPC 517 at 576 per Laddie J.

151 At the outset, it is necessary to describe the attributes of the skilled addressee and the relevant patent area. The skilled addressee is a legal construct and is assumed to be a person, or team, who is "not 'particularly imaginative or inventive'": Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [288] per French and Lindgren JJ. This does not mean that the addressee is a technician or person with only practical and non-academic qualifications. In fields such as chemistry, the addressee can be a person or group with high level qualifications and a capacity for original research: Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [30] . The test formulated by the majority in Alphapharm at [53]-[54] is whether the addressee would directly be led, as a matter of course, to pursue one avenue in the expectation that it may well produce the claimed result. Their Honours referred to the approach taken by Graham J in Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboraties Ltd [1970] RPC 157 at 187-188. His Honour framed the question in terms of whether a notional research group, at the relevant date, in all the circumstances, which include a knowledge of all the relevant prior art and of the facts of the nature and success of a chemical, would be led directly as a matter of course to try a particular substitution in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to, or better drug than, the existing drug or a body useful for any other purpose.</text>

<text>116 The relevant parts of the document are, to some extent, contradictory. However, the emphasis in the document is on the efficacy of a solution made at pH 7. In my view, having regard to the above, a skilled reader would be left confused by the document as to the pH at which the complex is manufactured. As stated in General Tyre &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1972] RPC 457 at 485-486, it is not sufficient that the prior disclosure contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner that would infringe the patentee's claim, but is at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not infringe the claim. The references to pH in the document cannot be described as "clear and unmistakable directions" as to how to produce the complex. Professor Reynolds gave evidence that the type of information in the document is not sufficient to enable the manufacture of the product. Mr Quigley, in cross-examination, referred to discrepancies between the information in the Information Package and the process actually employed during the production trials by the CSIRO. The evidence of Mr Nunn was that the information in the document would not enable the manufacture of the Calpep product without more information.

117 Accordingly, it cannot be said that the document anticipates the integers of Claims 7 and 18.</text>

<text>119 I am satisfied that the document was made available to a limited body of persons in circumstances where it appeared, on the face of the document, that it had the quality of confidence about it. It appeared that the document was communicated for limited purposes and imported an obligation not to disclose it and suggested to the reader that its disclosure would amount to a breach of confidence: see Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 437-438.

120 Section 24 of the Act provides that for the purpose of deciding whether an invention is novel, the Court must disregard information made publicly available without the consent of the patentee through any publication by another person who derived the information from the patentee.

121 NSI contends that the Information Package was made publicly available and that the evidence demonstrates that the Information Package was sent from Professor Reynolds' office to a number of prospective third party licensees in about May 1996, including Dr Barnett of SmithKline Beecham, Ms Finidori of Synthelabo in France, Dr Nelson of Consumer Health Care in the United States, Mr Markowitz of the Block Drug Company in the United States, Mr Faller of Procter &amp; Gamble in the United States, Mr Ziemkiewicz of Chesebrough Ponds in the United States and Mr Garland of NZP in New Zealand.</text>

<tocase>Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Limited [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/9.html</AustLII>
<text>150 In Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Limited [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 292, Aickin J defines "common general knowledge" as:
 
 "that which is known or used by those in the relevant trade. It forms the background knowledge and experience which is available to all in the trade in considering the making of new products, or the making of improvements in old, and it must be treated as being used by an individual as a general body of knowledge."

165 The University submits that Dr Mackinlay's evidence must be approached with some caution because it is unclear precisely what his knowledge was before March 1997. This is because it is unclear what Dr Mackinlay personally knew before March 1997 and what facts he assumed or additional knowledge he gained by reading articles provided to him by his instructing solicitors. The University also submits that Dr Mackinlay's views could have been influenced by hindsight because he was given a copy of the Complex Patent early in the litigation. Taken in isolation, this is not a decisive objection. However, the authorities show that it is a matter that goes to the weight to be given to Dr Mackinlay's evidence and points to the need to exercise a degree of caution when considering his evidence: see, for example, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Limited [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 293-294 per Aickin J.

166 NSI asserts that the claims lack the necessary inventive step because it was common general knowledge as at March 1997 that the Cluster Sequence was present in casein and that it served to bind calcium phosphate. It is contended that this knowledge, when taken with the 1958 paper by Reeves and Latour entitled "Calcium Phosphate Sequestering Phosphopeptide from Casein" ("the Reeves and Latour article"), would make the invention obvious to the skilled addressee.

167 Subject to my comments above regarding the skilled addressee, the principal relevant skilled addressees include Dr Mackinlay and Dr McKinnon.</text>

<text>151 At the outset, it is necessary to describe the attributes of the skilled addressee and the relevant patent area. The skilled addressee is a legal construct and is assumed to be a person, or team, who is "not 'particularly imaginative or inventive'": Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [288] per French and Lindgren JJ. This does not mean that the addressee is a technician or person with only practical and non-academic qualifications. In fields such as chemistry, the addressee can be a person or group with high level qualifications and a capacity for original research: Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [30] . The test formulated by the majority in Alphapharm at [53]-[54] is whether the addressee would directly be led, as a matter of course, to pursue one avenue in the expectation that it may well produce the claimed result. Their Honours referred to the approach taken by Graham J in Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation v Biorex Laboraties Ltd [1970] RPC 157 at 187-188. His Honour framed the question in terms of whether a notional research group, at the relevant date, in all the circumstances, which include a knowledge of all the relevant prior art and of the facts of the nature and success of a chemical, would be led directly as a matter of course to try a particular substitution in the expectation that it might well produce a useful alternative to, or better drug than, the existing drug or a body useful for any other purpose.

152 In approaching the question of obviousness, it is necessary to assess the inventiveness of the invention and not simply to examine each integer in isolation. In Alphapharm , the majority said at [58]:
 
 "The tracing of a course of action which was complex and detailed, as well as laborious, with a good deal of trial and error, with dead ends and the retracing of steps is not the taking of routine steps to which the hypothetical formulator was taken as a matter of course." 

This observation is pertinent to the present case. Mere verification or discovery is not an invention. An invention may be made by a brilliant sudden insight or act or by a slow and laborious approach: see In re Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 at 322 per Maugham J. Obviousness is not determined by asking whether a particular avenue of research is worth a try.

179 In addition, Professor Reynolds gave evidence of the lengthy research and experimental process and the detailed steps taken by him over 18 years to arrive at the invention, taking account of different stages and streams of research in relation to the formation of complexes at various pH values to increase the yield, the extensive trial and error involved and the consideration of documents teaching away from the invention. These elements are important considerations in relation to the question of obviousness: see Alphapharm at [53].

180 Dr Mackinlay was asked by NSI to describe, by way of a hypothetical research project ("the HRP"), how he would have gone about developing a chemical entity that would take advantage of the interaction between casein and calcium phosphate and have the maximum amount of calcium phosphate bound. This was based on the assumption that it was part of the common general knowledge that calcium phosphate binds to casein.

181 The University levelled several criticisms at the HRP. First, the University submitted that Dr Mackinlay's opinion was affected by hindsight. Secondly, it contended that the HRP assumed part of the inventive process. Thirdly, it was submitted that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the wrong test of obviousness by having regard to whether "straightforward" or "routine" steps could be taken to make the invention.

184 In relation to the second issue it can be seen from the parameters of the HRP that it assumes part of the inventive process, namely, the recognition of a desirable outcome. The desirable outcome was an advanced treatment for dental caries using calcium phosphate and casein. The University submits that, because of this assumption, the HRP lacked a "context", in the sense that the end goal was a given. The University also refers to the approach outlined by the High Court in Alphapharm at [53]. In this case, the High Court stated that the question is whether the person or group would be led directly as a matter of course to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it might well produce a useful result. This indicates the importance of context in providing a useful result. The research is then evaluated in the light of a given purpose, result or direction. Dr McKinnon said that he would want to know about the purpose or context of a HRP before embarking on it. He said that, without this information, he would not have embarked on the HRP engaged in by Dr Mackinlay because it lacked direction and definition.

185 In relation to the third issue, the University submits that Dr Mackinlay proceeded on the basis that the making of adjustments in relation to pH, temperature, ionisation and concentration were "routine" and that this disclosed an erroneous approach to the question of obviousness. The correct and different test that was accepted in Alphapharm at [53] is whether a person would be led directly, as a matter of course, to try the claimed invention in the expectation that it may well produce a useful or better alternative to the product that existed previously.

186 Finally, it is submitted by the University that the outcome of the HRP does not correspond with the terms of the invention because it does not refer to the form of the amorphous calcium phosphate and omits an important integer of Claim 7.

187 In my view, there is cogency in these submissions by the University and I accept them. I do not give any significant weight to the HRP on the question of obviousness.</text>

<text>206 It should be noted that the statement by the University is in the form of a submission as to the legal effect of the amended patent claim and it must be considered in that context. The statement involved a consideration of the state of the prior art. It is settled law that an applicant for a patent can make submissions to the Patent Office as to the proper construction or effect of a claim, and this will not be found to have been a false suggestion or representation simply because such a submission may later be held to have been incorrect: see ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 49 IPR 513 at [91] .

207 Insofar as the representation is based on belief, it has not been shown to be a false belief or one which is not reasonably held. On the contrary, the conclusions that I have reached on the issues of novelty and obviousness meet the submissions of NSI.

208 In closing addresses, NSI sought to raise other questions that were not pleaded. I do not consider that these should be entertained. However, in any event, in my view, they do not affect the conclusion that I have reached in any way.</text>

<text>209 Section 40 of the Act requires that a complete specification must be clear, succinct and fairly based on the matter described in the specification. NSI submits that the Complex Patent specification does not comply with these requirements. In Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [69] , the High Court formulated the relevant question as being whether there has been a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the invention is broadly or in a general sense described in the body of the specification. Another way that the question can be posed is to ask whether the claim travels beyond the disclosure in the specification: Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 240 per Barwick CJ.</text>

<text>214 The University refers to authorities that support the proposition that there must be a basis in fact for comparative advertising and to publish comparative claims to ensure that the comparison is accurate: see Stuart v Alexander (1981) 37 ALR 161 at 163 per Lockhart J; Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker (A'asia) Pty Ltd (1998) 18 IPR 270 at 280; Duracell Australia Pty Ltd v Union Carbide Australia Ltd (1988) 14 IPR 293 at 299 per Burchett J. In Colgate Palmolive Pty Ltd v Rexona Pty Ltd (1981) 37 ALR 91, the Court held that it is misleading conduct to make comparative efficiency claims that imply they were made on a scientific basis when, in fact, there is no proper scientific basis for making those claims. That case related to a claim in respect of an ingredient in a toothpaste. A comparison may be misleading by omission of a material fact that would be necessary to render the comparison fair and it can be misleading for a corporation not to put forward sufficient information to dispel the possibility that a recipient may be misled. In some circumstances, it may be misleading to make a statement implying that there is an adequate foundation in scientific knowledge to justify it when, taken in context, the scientific statement does not provide a proper foundation, for example, see Sterling Winthrop Pty Ltd v Boots Co (Australia) Pty ltd (1995) 32 IPR 361 at 365 and the cases cited therein.</text>
