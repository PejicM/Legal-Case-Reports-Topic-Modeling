<tocase>Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc (1987) 9 IPR 282; [1987] FCA 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1987/298.html</AustLII>
<text>19 In Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc (1987) 9 IPR 282, a body calling itself the "Federation of Australian Accountants" had published advertisements in the Australian Financial Review newspaper stating:
 "(FAA Coat of Arms) 
 
 The Federation of Australian Accountants wish to invite suitably qualified accountants to join our federation. We are currently running examinations to increase your status to C.P.A. Any accountant who wishes to do so with our federation is encouraged to inquire. Any accountant that becomes a C.P.A. with our federation will be allowed to use our logos for advertising purposes. 
 
 Federation of Australian Accountants Inc Box 87, GPO Adelaide 5001." 
 
 

Having regard to the issues raised in the present case, it is worth noting that the decision does not make clear whether the respondent Federation intended its members to be referred to as Certified Practising Accountants or Certified Public Accountants.

20 CPA Australia, which at that time was the Australian Society of Accountants, sought injunctive relief. In granting that relief, Woodward J stated (at 285 286):
 
 "Having studied the affidavits, and considered counsel's arguments, I am left in no doubt that, over the last three years, the applicant has gone to great trouble and expense -- to the tune of over $3 million -- to establish the status of its qualification of Certified Practising Accountant or CPA. I am satisfied that, even in that comparatively short space of time, it has built up a substantial reputation in the accountancy profession and in the general community for that qualification. The expression "Certified Practising Accountant" was apparently unknown in Australia before the applicant began its campaign, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is used in any other English-speaking country. It seems that the expression "Certified Public Accountant" has currency in the United States, but there is no evidence before me to indicate how widespread its usage is or just what status it conveys. 
 
 The applicant is a large professional organisation of accountants, having some 53,000 members. Its antecedent bodies date back to 1887. It charges its members an annual subscription of $214, spends some $17 million each year on its professional objects, and employs 160 people. It is, in short, a very large and reputable professional body, which recruits some 2500 new members each year -- over 70 percent of those who graduate in accountancy from tertiary institutions. Along with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, it has provided the only regulation of the profession in most states of Australia over a number of years."

21 Having made those findings, Woodward J further accepted (at 286) that: 
 
 "... the opening paragraph of the advertisement is likely to mislead students, and other persons wishing to obtain accountancy qualifications, into believing they can obtain the applicant's CPA qualification, or its equivalent, from the respondent federation. Users of accountancy services may also be misled into thinking that the federation is in some way connected with the applicant, or that any organisation can award such a qualification, thus devaluing it in the eyes of such potential clients."

23 Woodward J granted the injunctions sought, including orders that the respondents be restrained not only from publishing the advertisement in question, but also: 
 
 "from representing by any other means that the firstnamed respondent is entitled to confer CPA (Certified Practising Accountant) status on members of the firstnamed respondent;" 
 

(For the relevant orders, see the unreported version: Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc [1987] FCA 298.)

31 In Australian Society of Accountants v Federation of Australian Accountants Inc Woodward J reached precisely the same conclusion regarding the words "Certified Practising Accountant". His Honour's decision was upheld by a Full Court. Of course, that decision turned on a question of fact in a case involving only one of the two parties before me. However, it is fair to say that his Honour reached that view on the basis of only three years of promotion of the designation "Certified Practising Accountant". The evidence before me is much stronger. The term has now been used for more than twenty-three years, and as previously indicated has found its way into both State and Commonwealth legislation.

32 For these reasons, Mr Dunn's argument that the word "certified" means nothing more than "qualified", and that as he has a degree in accounting, and practises as an accountant, he is entitled with impunity to describe himself as a "Certified Practising Accountant", must fail. The term has a distinct secondary meaning, and as a consequence Mr Dunn's use of it would be likely to mislead or deceive.

33 Mr Dunn's argument fails at other points as well. Though he has a degree, one would not normally describe the University that granted it to him as having "certified" him as a practising accountant. The reason is plain. Many graduates in accounting do not go on to practise in that field.</text>

<text>24 Woodward J's decision was upheld on appeal to the Full Court: Federation of Australian Accountants Inc v Australian Society of Accountants [1988] FCA 101. Lockhart J with whom Northrop J agreed) described, and dismissed, the central argument raised by the Federation on appeal in these terms (at 10 11):
 
 "The principal argument on the appeal was that the absence from the advertisement of a stated and specific link between the initials "CPA" and the Society was fatal to the Society's case, and that his Honour's findings to the contrary were erroneous. 
 
 ... 
 
 The point which resolves the central issues in this appeal is that the letters CPA have plainly acquired a special and distinctive meaning in relation to the accountancy profession in Australia. It is plain that the opening paragraph of the advertisement is likely to mislead students and others wishing to obtain accountancy qualifications into believing that they can obtain the Society's CPA qualification from the Federation."</text>

<tocase>Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise (2003) 61 IPR 98</tocase>
<text>36 Much the same can be said about Mr Dunn's use of the phrase "Certified Public Accountant". That term closely resembles the designation "Certified Practising Accountant". The visual and aural similarities are real. It is clearly established that the use of different but similar words and phrases can constitute misleading or deceptive conduct. For example, in Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise (2003) 61 IPR 98 the Court was concerned with the use by one business of the name "Crazy Ron's". Allsop J held that that name was misleading or deceptive because of its similarity to the pre-established trade name "Crazy John's". His Honour further concluded that disclaimers would not be sufficient, and that injunctive relief was appropriate.

37 Finally, the use of the term "Certified Public Accountant" would be likely to mislead because it suggests that there is some organisation that awards that qualification, and that Mr Dunn has satisfied the requirements of that organisation in order to acquire that status. In fact, the evidence reveals that there is no such organisation. Mr Dunn has not undertaken any continuing education of the kind that the applicant requires in order to grant certification, and he has not undertaken any examinations which are a prerequisite to the designation in question. He may be a public accountant holding tertiary qualifications. However, he is not a "Certified Public Accountant" because no professional body or organisation has conferred that title upon him.

38 In my opinion, the applicant is entitled to the injunctive relief sought under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act . Mr Dunn acknowledged in his final submissions that, unless restrained, he will use one or other of the expressions "Certified Practising Accountant" or "Certified Public Accountant" in his letterhead. That would amount to a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , and the applicant is entitled to prevent that from occurring.</text>

28 Statements that are capable of more than one meaning may be misleading or deceptive provided that the meaning for which the applicant contends is one that would be reasonably open, and might be drawn by a significant number of those to whom the representation is made. In the same way, a statement may contain a representation that is implied, rather than express. That is why a statement that is literally true can be misleading or deceptive: National Exchange at [48] [52].</text>

<text>40 Mr Dunn submitted that, even if an injunction were granted, he should not be required to pay the applicant's costs. His longstanding dispute with the applicant regarding its rights to describe its members in the way that it does reflects a genuinely felt sense of grievance on his part. In some respects, he might be regarded as a "stirrer". To paraphrase the remarks of Murphy J in Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55 ; (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 316 317, Mr Dunn is entitled to be a stirrer. He is not, however, entitled to exemption from the ordinary rules that govern proceedings in this Court. In accordance with normal practice, costs should follow the event.

30 I will deal firstly with the applicant's case based upon Mr Dunn's stated refusal to undertake not to use the term "Certified Practising Accountant" in his letterhead. I am satisfied, on the evidence, that those of the applicant's members who have been accorded the qualification of "Certified Practising Accountant" have acquired a reputation through that designation. I accept the applicant's submission that the combination of those three words have a secondary meaning, namely that a person who has that designation has obtained "membership of [the applicant] which, by its tests and examinations and by its rules and requirements as to qualification, confer[s] on its members a status different from that of other members of the profession" who do not have the same qualification: Society of Accountants and Auditors v Goodway and London Association of Accountants Ltd at 500.</text>
