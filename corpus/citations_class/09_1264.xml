<text>Branson J, in Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 498 ; (1999) 162 ALR 625 , rejected the contention that the Court's power in s 43 of the Act empowered her to make an order that the Commonwealth pay the applicant's costs of an extradition proceeding which had been reviewed by the Court. Her Honour also rejected the contention that there was some broader jurisdiction in the Court to remedy injustice by the making of such an order. Her Honour's decision was upheld by the Full Court in Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 1016 ; (1999) 92 FCR 575.</text>
