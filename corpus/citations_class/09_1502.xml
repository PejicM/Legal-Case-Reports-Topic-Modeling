<text>I must take into account, follow and apply the relevant and binding reasoning and ratio of the Full Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 123 ; (2008) 169 FCR 227. I consider that I should apply the following principles and propositions contained in the reasoning of the Full Court whether they be the ratio, or one of the rationes, of the decision or persuasive and considered obiter dicta: 
(a) In determining a claim for protection of documents from disclosure and inspection on the ground of public interest immunity a Court must undertake a balancing exercise and determine whether the public interest in protecting from disclosure the identity of an informer outweighs the public interest that in a civil proceeding a party should not be denied access to relevant evidence; 
 
 
(b) The partial or limited disclosure of the identity of an informer is not conclusive in determining whether the identity of the informer should be protected from being disclosed in documents sought to be the subject of inspection on the ground of public interest immunity. Immunity from further disclosure is not necessarily lost where there has been a partial limited disclosure of the identity of an informer;
 
 
(c) The transcripts of the examination of the informer or informers would, both directly and circumstantially, identify the informer or the informers; 
 
 
(d) The appropriate test to apply in determining whether inspection of the relevant documents and transcripts might disclose the identity of an informer or informers is to ask whether there is in the documents any material by which "a shrewd idea" might be conveyed as to the identity of the informer or informers, noting that documents taken together may convey information which each, by itself, could not convey. Further, the benefit of the doubt should be in favour of non-disclosure.

The observations I made in pars [13]-[20] in my reasons for judgment published on 23 July 2009 apply in relation to ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by KPMG.

I have considered the submissions made by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents and audio tapes and the redaction or masking proposed by ASIC in relation to a number of those documents. I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents goes beyond the redaction and masking which is necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC. I set out in Confidential Appendix A to these reasons my conclusion whether ASIC's claims for public interest immunity in respect of the documents should be upheld or rejected and my conclusion as to the redaction and masking of the documents which I consider should be undertaken. This Appendix will only be made available to ASIC's legal advisors and the deponents of its affidavits for the purpose of determining the form of any public non-confidential order which I should make.</text>
