<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor (2005) 225 CLR</tocase>
<text>It seems to me that this proposition would be contrary to what the High Court said in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [12] . In my opinion, the effect of what their Honours said in SZBYR at [22] was that the Tribunal's reasons are not the starting point for determining whether it considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review. What their Honours said at [22] in SZBYR was that the need for "unbundling" is "correspondingly reduced."</text>

<tocase>MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/319.html</AustLII>
<text>In coming to this conclusion, his Honour distinguished the decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483. In that case, Heerey J observed that the decision of the High Court in SZBYR &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor (2007) 235 ALR 609 impliedly overruled a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court in which it was held that an assessment of whether the Tribunal has complied with section 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal. Driver FM considered that MZXBQ was distinguishable from the present case because in MZXBQ , the relevant information was raised by the Tribunal at the section 425 hearing.

The decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ is distinguishable, because it appears, from [6] and [12] of his Honour's reasons, that the information in question was referred to in the course of the Tribunal hearing, even though there was no reference to it in the section 424A letter or the Tribunal's reasons. Jagot J followed MZXBQ in SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 226 , so too did Siopis J in SZMFZ , but both of those cases are distinguishable from the present matter upon the basis that the information in question was considered in those cases to be relevant by the Tribunal, either explicitly or by inference from the review process.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1196.html</AustLII>
<text>In my view, these submissions are correct and are supported by the authorities. It is true that the High Court in SZBYR impliedly overruled a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court which held that an assessment of whether the Tribunal has complied with section 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal. Indeed, in SZBYR at [22], the High Court rejected the need for "unbundling" of the Tribunal's reasons, an approach which had been adopted in authorities of this court such as Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at [99] , and SZEEU &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [208] . But I do not think it follows from what the High Court said in SZBYR that in making an assessment of whether section 424A(1) was engaged, a court can never have regard to the reasons of the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>I do not consider that the conclusion I have reached is contrary to the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. In that case, the court held that the applicant was entitled to assume the issues considered dispositive by the delegate to be issues which arose in relation to the decision under review. The High Court also held that if the Tribunal were inclined to reach its decision by reference to an issue other than those considered to be dispositive by the delegate, a failure to notify the applicant would be a denial of procedural fairness and a contravention of section 425(1).

In my opinion, that decision is of no assistance to the appellant in this case, because here the position is the opposite to that which occurred in SZBEL , because the Tribunal considered the issues to be narrower than those which were considered to be dispositive by the delegate.

The appellant appeared in person this morning. She was assisted by a Mandarin interpreter. She did not address me on the question of law to which I have referred, but I have given it careful consideration in coming to the views that I have reached.

The notice of appeal seeks to raise other grounds. The appellant did not speak to them, but I have considered them. The first ground is an unparticularised claim that the Federal Magistrate "erred in law". That seems to be covered by what I have said above.</text>

<text>The decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ is distinguishable, because it appears, from [6] and [12] of his Honour's reasons, that the information in question was referred to in the course of the Tribunal hearing, even though there was no reference to it in the section 424A letter or the Tribunal's reasons.

<text>The remaining five grounds were not raised before the Federal Magistrate, and the Minister objected to leave being granted to rely upon them for the first time on the appeal. In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [18] [31], Lander J reviewed the authorities on the question of the grant of leave in these circumstances. His Honour was of the view that this court should not be made, de facto, the court of original jurisdiction when sitting on appeal.</text>

<text>Ground 6 claims that the appellant was not provided with a tape-recording of her interview with the delegate, although the section 424A letter does refer to the interview tape. However, there is authority in the decision of Flick J in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [12] [14] that the Tribunal was not obliged to provide the tape recording.

It follows, in my view, that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

<tocase>SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1890.html</AustLII>
<text>The question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. As Siopis J observed in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] : 
 [T]he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information.

That is to say, in a proper case, the Court, in making its assessment, may draw inferences from the Tribunal's reasons as to whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision. In the present case, not only was there no mention of the information at the Tribunal hearing, it was not mentioned in the Tribunal's reasons or in any document generated by the Tribunal during the review process. The only inference therefore available was that the Tribunal did not consider the information to be relevant. It follows, in my opinion, that Driver FM was correct in the conclusion that he reached.

The decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ is distinguishable, because it appears, from [6] and [12] of his Honour's reasons, that the information in question was referred to in the course of the Tribunal hearing, even though there was no reference to it in the section 424A letter or the Tribunal's reasons. Jagot J followed MZXBQ in SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 226 , so too did Siopis J in SZMFZ , but both of those cases are distinguishable from the present matter upon the basis that the information in question was considered in those cases to be relevant by the Tribunal, either explicitly or by inference from the review process.</text>

<tocase>VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/158.html</AustLII>
<text>However, his Honour referred to the decision of the Full Court in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , in which it was said that, in cases such as this, leave is more readily granted where the point has merit and there is no prejudice. It seems to me that, without the need to address in any detail the principles referred to by Lander J, it is sufficient to dispose of the further grounds upon the basis that they do not have sufficient merit.

Ground 2 states that the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by a reasonable apprehension of bias. This has not been demonstrated.

Ground 3 expresses disagreement with the Tribunal's conclusion at [111] of its reasons. This is an impermissible claim for merits review.</text>
