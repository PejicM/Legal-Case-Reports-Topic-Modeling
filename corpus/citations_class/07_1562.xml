<tocase>Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>21 It is well settled that the Court is vested with discretion to award security for costs, and that the power is wide, with the need to exercise the discretion judicially being the only relevant limitation ( Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 3). Although O 28 r 3 Federal Court Rules refers to matters the Court may take into account when considering an application for an order for security for costs under s 56 of the Federal Court Act, it is clear that the rule is not intended to be an exhaustive statement of the factors the Court may consider, nor does the rule limit the power of the Court under s 56 ( Bell 2 FCR at 2-3).</text>

<tocase>Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972</tocase>
<text>23 Two additional guidelines suggested by Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 at 50,635 are:
 
 
 1. Whether there are aspects of public interest which weigh in the balance against the making of an order; and
 2. Whether there are any particular discretionary matters peculiar to the circumstances of the case.

24 In this case, the first question is whether the applicant is capable of meeting a costs order in favour of the respondents in the event that the respondents are successful in defending the applicant's claim in the substantive proceedings.
 Submissions of the respondents

25 Referring extensively to Mr Thirgood's affidavit, Mr Piggott for the applicant submitted in summary that the bases for the belief that the applicant will be unable to meet a costs order are as follows:
 
 
 1. The applicant pleads in its statement of claim that it did not complete the contracts because it was unable to raise the necessary funds.
 2. The applicant has a paid up capital of $1.00.
 3. The applicant has granted a fixed and floating charge over all of its assets to St George Bank Ltd to secure up to $6.56 million, and a fixed charge over a motor vehicle to BMW Australia Finance Ltd to secure in excess of $43,000.
 4. The applicant owns no real property in Queensland, and although it is the registered proprietor of three real properties in Western Australia each of those properties is subject to a registered mortgage and two are subject to a registered caveat.
 5. Property of which the applicant is the registered proprietor in Western Australia - the Canning Road Property - is held by the applicant on trust for the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust. The applicant entered the relevant contracts the subject of its claim as trustee for a different trust, namely the SDA Tarameo Unit Trust.
 6. The applicant is yet to meet a costs order made by Siopis J on 6 February 2007.
 7. In correspondence and in affidavit material filed on the notice of motion: 
 

a) The applicant has not asserted, and has made no attempt to show, that it could meet a costs order out of assets it owns beneficially.
 
b) The applicant has not explained or identified the level of its indebtedness presently secured by each of the registered charges and mortgages identified by the respondent.
 
c) The applicant has not explained the registered caveats over two of its real properties.

26 Submissions 1-6 were not disputed by the applicant.

27 In addition to this the respondents challenge the alleged value of property held by the applicant. As I noted earlier in this judgment, Mr Piggott objected to para 4 in Mr Hosgood's affidavit which reads as follows:
 
 "On 11 September 2007, I obtained a document from my client titled 'Executive Summary Valuation' annexed hereto and marked JOH-01. I am informed by this document that on 15 April 2007, the total aggregate market value as complete of Canning Road Development was $4,775,000."

28 The annexure JOH-01 titled "Executive Summary Valuation" appears to be a document of 14 pages in length relating to the Canning Road Development prepared by Hegney Property Valuations for the applicant. Mr Piggott directed my attention to the extensive disclaimer in cl 13 of the document which includes, inter alia , the following statements:
 
 "Neither the whole nor part of this report, nor any reference thereto may be included in any document, circular or statement without our written approval of the form and context in which it will appear.
 In accordance with standard practice it is stated that this report is prepared for the addressee only and no liability for damages incurred by a third party using the whole or any part thereof will be accepted.
 This valuation has been prepared on specific instructions from Keith Amor for the purpose of establishing current market value. The report is not relied upon by any other person of for any other purpose. We accept no liability to third parties nor do we contemplate that this report will be relied upon by third parties. We invite other parties who may come into possession of this report to seek our written consent to them relying on this report. We reserve our right to withhold consent or to review the contents of this report in the event that our consent is sought."

29 Mr Piggott further submitted that the Executive Summary Valuation did not comply with the Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia. In summary, Mr Piggott submitted that in light of these issues, the probative value of the evidence as to value of the Canning Road Development was low and should not be admitted.

<tocase>General Credits Ltd v Tawilla Pty Ltd (1984) 1 Qd R 388</tocase>
<text>41 If the respondents sought to enforce payment of security for costs against the applicant, the respondents would have a claim against the applicant, which presumably would then claim a right of indemnity out of the trust assets of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust. This assumes, of course, that the applicant's liability was properly incurred in the affairs of the trust (cf comments of McPherson J in General Credits Ltd v Tawilla Pty Ltd (1984) 1 Qd R 388 at 390, followed by White J in Westpac Banking Corporation v Garrett [2004] SASC 265 at [27] ). As I have already discussed, it is uncertain in this case whether the liability of the applicant would be properly incurred on behalf of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust, such as to entitle the applicant to a right of indemnity.</text>

<tocase>Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Get Motor Cycles Pty Ltd (formerly Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2007] FCA 1078</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1078.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In my view, on the basis of the evidence before me and the submissions of the parties, there is reason to believe that the applicant is unable to pay the costs of the respondents if they are successful in their defence. I take this view for the following reasons:
 
 
 &#8226; As I noted earlier, there is no dispute that the costs of the respondents are as calculated by Mr Graham.
 &#8226; As I also noted earlier, there is no dispute as to the reason for the failure of the applicant to complete the relevant contracts, the low paid-up capital of the applicant, the failure of the applicant to date to meet the costs order of Siopis J, the substantial securities given to financial services providers over both real and personal property of the applicant, the absence of real property in Queensland, and the fact that what seems to be the primary assets of the applicant are held by the applicant on trust for an entity which appears to have no interest in this litigation.
 &#8226; No evidence has been produced by the applicant as to the value of assets, if any, held by the applicant in its own right or on trust for any entity which has an interest in this litigation, including the SDA Tarameo Unit Trust.
 &#8226; Even assuming that the Canning Road Development would be available to satisfy an order for security for costs, at present, there is no satisfactory evidence before the Court as to the value of that property. In my view, to accept the evidence in the "Executive Summary Valuation" annexed to Mr Hosgood's affidavit would unfairly prejudice the respondents. I uphold the objection of Mr Piggott as to the admissibility of both para 4 and annexure JOH-01 of Mr Hosgood's affidavit. In particular, I note: 
 
 
 
 
 o As a general proposition, evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed: s 76(1) Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). An exception to the rule in s 76(1) is where a person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, in which case evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge is admissible: s 79 Evidence Act 
 o In this case no evidence has been produced as to whether Hegney Property Valuations, or the person at that firm who prepared the "Executive Summary Valuation", possessed specialised knowledge within the meaning of s 79 Evidence Act so as to render admissible the "Executive Summary Valuation" and its contents.
 o Even if the "Executive Summary Valuation" was prepared by a person with specialised knowledge within the meaning of s 79 Evidence Act , the disclaimers in the document are such that not only is it clear that the document was not prepared with a view to it being relied on by the applicant in litigation, it appears that the author of the document specifically disqualified the document from such use. The Court has a general discretion to exclude evidence under s 135 Evidence Act where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or be misleading or confusing, or cause or result in undue waste of time. The fact that the "Executive Summary Valuation" is relied upon by the applicant as evidence, in circumstances where the person who prepared the report did not appear to appreciate that the document would be the subject of such use, in my view strongly militates in favour of its exclusion as evidence under s 135: cf Campbell J in United Rural Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lopmand Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 870 at [15] .
 o Finally, I note that the "Executive Summary Valuation" does not comply with the Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia issued 6 June 2007, or its predecessor the Guidelines for Expert Witnesses in Proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia issued 11 April 2007. While I note that the guidelines are not intended to address all aspects of an expert witness's duties, they are clearly intended to assist expert witnesses prepare reports which avoid the criticism that the expert lacks objectivity. In this case, it is clear that no consideration has been given by the person who prepared the document as to Guidelines, or their duty to the Court.

42 In any event, in relation to this Deed of Guarantee, I am further disinclined to exercise my discretion in favour of the applicant where this Court has previously indicated that a personal guarantee given in satisfaction for security for costs is acceptable in only exceptional circumstances: Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 , cf Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Get Motor Cycles Pty Ltd (formerly Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2007] FCA 1078 at [30] - [31] . The applicant has demonstrated no circumstances in this case justifying the acceptance of a personal guarantee as distinct from a cash payment or a bank guarantee.

<text>22 Principles which courts typically take into account in determining such applications were outlined by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 197-198 as follows:
 
 1. That such applications should be brought promptly. 
 
 
 2. That regard is to be had to the strength and bona fides of the applicant's case.
 3. Whether the applicant's impecuniosity was caused by the respondent's conduct subject of the claim.
 4. Whether the respondent's application for security is oppressive.
 5. Whether there are any persons standing behind the company who are likely to benefit from the litigation and who are willing to provide the necessary security.
 6. Whether persons standing behind the company have offered any personal undertaking to be liable for the costs.
 7. Is the party against whom security is sought in substance a plaintiff.</text>

<text>40 However in my view, even assuming that the document is a guarantee as a matter of law, in the absence of supporting evidence or authority I am not prepared to accept that cl 12.1(d) empowers the applicant to either assume an obligation or give a guarantee binding the assets of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust of a substantial sum as security for the costs of the applicant in its capacity as trustee for another Unit Trust in litigation in which, prima facie , the beneficiaries of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust have no interest. Irrespective of any commonality of trusteeship, I am not persuaded that the broad terms of the power vested in the applicant by cl 12.1(d) permit the applicant to act in potential disregard of the interests of the beneficiaries of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust (cf, by analogy, Walker v Wimborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1). Indeed although the proposed Deed of Guarantee, annexed to the affidavit of Mr MacKinlay, contains a statement that the applicant is "entitled to be indemnified out of the trust property of the SDPG Unit Trust for any liability which (sic) incurs (sic) behalf of the trust", it contains no reference to the applicant being entitled on behalf of the Success Development &amp; Property Group Unit Trust to enter this transaction, and be indemnified out of that property for liabilities arising out of this transaction.</text>
