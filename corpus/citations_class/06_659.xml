<text>22 This passage suggests that the AAT was influenced by some notion of estoppel on the part of the applicant, based upon its disapproval of Centrelink's failure to form the requisite opinion, and act upon it. If so, there is no justification for that approach: Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 92 ALR 93 per Gummow J, and Attorney General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 18 per Mason CJ. See generally M Aronson, B Dyer and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, 2004) at 359-64. It may be noted that there is no suggestion in the present case of any abuse of power, or breach of promise, on the part of the applicant.</text>
