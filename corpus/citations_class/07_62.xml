<text>1 In this appeal, the Appellant contends that Federal Magistrate Driver erred ( SZGZQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1203) in dismissing on 17 August 2006 an Application for Review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 16 January 2004 and delivered on 10 February 2004 affirming a decision of the Minister's Delegate refusing the Appellant's application for protection visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').

2 The Appellant's grounds of appeal are these.

3 First, the Appellant contends that Federal Magistrate Driver erred by failing to find that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct test in determining the degree of satisfaction required to be established in order to find a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason (Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees ('the Convention') as amended by the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ('the Refugees' Protocol')) as contended for by the Appellant. As a subset of that notion, the Appellant contends that since the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the Appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution in the absence of further information from the Appellant, the Tribunal ought to have called for further information from the Appellant.</text>

<text>14 The approach adopted by the Tribunal is entirely consistent with the observations of their Honours in SJSB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 255 at [15] , per Ryan, Jacobson and Lander JJ; Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [17] , per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ and Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. The Appellant contends that the Tribunal ought to have exercised a statutory power to seek further information from the Appellant before reaching a conclusion as to whether it could be satisfied of the relevant matters. Section 424 of the Act is an enabling provision. It does not create a mandatory obligation, in terms.</text>
