<tocase>Alfred Thangarajah Durayappah v W J Fernando and Others [1967] 2 AC 337</tocase>
<text>40 The urgency of the circumstances may limit the period in which a person may have a right to be heard: see Alfred Thangarajah Durayappah v W J Fernando and Others [1967] 2 AC 337 at 346; see also Re Refugee Tribunal and Another; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 176 ALR 219 at [60] . The period in which to show cause provided in the Notice was short. However, the operation of the Mutitjulu community was in a state of crisis, and had been so since 1 July 2006. Accordingly I consider that in these circumstances the period prescribed was reasonable. Even if such period of notice were not regarded as reasonable, the Court would not grant the relief sought in view of the urgency and exceptional circumstances surrounding the need for an administrator's appointment.</text>

<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; 222 ALR 411</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>43 Mutitjulu further submits that the Registrar was subconsciously motivated to issue the Notice based upon untested information supplied to it by FaCSIA: see Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; 222 ALR 411 at [19] . Mutitjulu submits that the Registrar, prior to the issue of the Notice, was bound to put the allegations made by FaCSIA to Mutitjulu as being ' credible, relevant and significant ' information, and to obtain a response from Mutitjulu prior to the issue of the Notice.

44 In VEAL the Court was concerned with the failure of the Tribunal to inform the appellant of the existence of a letter which could have influenced the decision which it was required to make. In Kioa and Others v West and Another [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, the Court determined that the decision-maker was required to provide an opportunity to a party to respond to information which was adverse to the interests of that party, and which the decision maker proposes to take into account in making the decision (at 628).

45 Although generally an opportunity should be given to a party whose interests are affected by a decision to deal with adverse information that is ' credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made ' (see Kioa v West at 629), the allegations influencing the decision of FaCSIA was not information which was credible, relevant and significant to the decision of the Registrar to appoint an administrator. That information ' can and should be put aside from consideration by the decision-maker as not, credible, not relevant, or of little or no significance to the decision to be made.' (see VEAL at [17]).</text>

<tocase>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223</tocase>
<text>41 Mutitjulu submits that the Notice was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense (see: Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223) or that it was otherwise procedurally unfair because only one day was allowed for a response.

42 Mutitjulu submits that prior to the issue of the Notice, the Registrar was bound to satisfy herself that adequate grounds existed to warrant the issue of the Notice. Mutitjulu submits that the grounds relied upon by FaCSIA to cease funding to Mutitjulu were based upon unproven allegations that were broadcast in the ' Lateline' program on ABC television which related to alleged unlawful conduct of several persons holding office within the Mutitjulu community. Mutitjulu submits that it was the duty of the Registrar to ascertain whether there was any truth in such allegations. It submits that Mr Armstrong was aware of this possibility when, in a memorandum prepared by him in support of the issue of the Notice he observed:
 
 'Whilst the reply [of Mutitjulu] does raise some interesting points surrounding procedural unfairness by FaCSIA (which is not for ORAC to consider).'

49 In the circumstances it was not unreasonable, in the Wednesbury sense, for the Registrar to issue the Notice. The Wednesbury unreasonableness alleged is of the kind referred to by Weinberg J in Australian Retailers Association and Others v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at 585 [570] where His Honour said:
 
 'Many of the particulars relied upon by the applicants in support of Wednesbury unreasonableness seem to me simply to manifest disagreement on their part with some detail or other of PSB's reasoning. Even if there is substance in some of their points, this does not give rise to reviewable error.'

50 The Registrar had before her information that was ' credible, relevant and significant ' ( Kioa v West , per Brennan J 628-9) namely that funding to the community had ceased; that Mutitjulu was in debt; and that there was no prospect of any income to support the operations of the community unless an administrator was appointed which justified the issue of the Notice. These were relevant considerations for the Registrar. For the reasons specified above I consider that the Registrar's decision was reached ' by a process of logical reasoning ': see Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161. I therefore reject Mutitjulu's Wednesbury submissions.</text>

<text>65 Even if, contrary to the above finding, Mr Andrews did not possess the requisite power for the purpose of the appointment, the circumstances surrounding the appointment were such that the Court would exercise its discretion to decline the relief claimed. Considering the arrangements that may have been made in the intervening period the consequences of deeming the appointment invalid are such as may cause considerable inconvenience. The 'defacto officers' doctrine' was considered by Kirby J in Cassell v The Queen [2000] HCA 8 ; (2000) 201 CLR 189 at [71] in which it was observed that the doctrine was usually invoked to cure an accidental or unintentional lack of authority: see also GJ Coles &amp; Co Ltd and Others v Retail Trade Industrial Tribunal and Others (1987) 7 NSWLR 503 at 525-526. At 527 it was said:
 
 'Whatever is the true account of the origin of the de facto officer rule, its rationale in modern times is the protection which affords the public' 

Such doctrine would have application with equal force in the present circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Jamieson v Guri War Ngundagar Aboriginal Corporation [2001] FCA 1104</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1104.html</AustLII>
<text>35 Mutitjulu claims that the period of notice of one day was unreasonably short. It submits that s 71(1) requires ' a reasonable period ' and that the period allowed was simply too short to satisfy this requirement. Mutitjulu refers to the decision of Stone J in Jamieson v Guri War Ngundagar Aboriginal Corporation [2001] FCA 1104 wherein Her Honour observed that a period of seven days was ' a very short time '.

36 The Registrar was aware, prior to the issue of the Notice, that Mutitjulu's accounts recorded a deficit of $171,595.60, that funding had ceased from 1 July 2006, and that no funds would be available to pay staff or to provide for any of the services necessary for the continued operation of the community. Accordingly, Mutitjulu was unfunded.

37 Despite meetings between FaCSIA and Mutitjulu, no arrangement had been made acceptable to FaCSIA for a resumption of funding in the absence of an administrator. The Registrar was aware that Mutitjulu had been afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against it by FaCSIA and despite Mutitjulu's representations contained in its letter of 11 July 2006 to the Minister, the situation remained unchanged. The letter from Mutitjulu to the Registrar did not offer any plan of action which might have led to a restoration of funding. Accordingly the Registrar was entitled to believe that the funding of Mutitjulu would not be resumed.</text>

<tocase>Kioa and Others v West and Another [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>44 In VEAL the Court was concerned with the failure of the Tribunal to inform the appellant of the existence of a letter which could have influenced the decision which it was required to make. In Kioa and Others v West and Another [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, the Court determined that the decision-maker was required to provide an opportunity to a party to respond to information which was adverse to the interests of that party, and which the decision maker proposes to take into account in making the decision (at 628).

45 Although generally an opportunity should be given to a party whose interests are affected by a decision to deal with adverse information that is ' credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made ' (see Kioa v West at 629), the allegations influencing the decision of FaCSIA was not information which was credible, relevant and significant to the decision of the Registrar to appoint an administrator. That information ' can and should be put aside from consideration by the decision-maker as not, credible, not relevant, or of little or no significance to the decision to be made.' (see VEAL at [17]).

46 The ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration similarly does not arise in this instance as this ground is only established if the decision maker fails to take into account a consideration which he or she is bound to take into account in making the decision: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39; Kioa v West at 630. The Registrar was not obliged to consider the material relied upon by FaCSIA because the Registrar had no power to control FaCSIA's decision making. The Registrar was only concerned with the consequence of the disputed matters between Mutitjulu and FaCSIA, namely that funding had ceased on 30 June 2006 and that Mutitjulu had no source of income from that time.

47 Section 71(2) of the ACA Act provides that the Registrar may appoint an administrator if satisfied that any of the grounds specified in that section have been established. The statute does not require the Registrar to consider matters which were relevant to a separate decision made by FaCSIA. Accordingly the Registrar was not bound to take those matters in to consideration in her decision to appoint an administrator. The impugned allegations are of a kind referred to by Brennan J in Kioa v West where His Honour said at 628:
 
 'Administrative decision making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made' 

The events which caused FaCSIA to determine that funding should not be continued is not a matter which was relevant and significant to that consideration by the Registrar to appoint the administrator.

48 Further, the Registrar was aware that FaCSIA had provided an opportunity for Mutitjulu to respond and that Mutitjulu had done so. Despite such response, FaCSIA remained unmoved.

50 The Registrar had before her information that was ' credible, relevant and significant ' ( Kioa v West , per Brennan J 628-9) namely that funding to the community had ceased; that Mutitjulu was in debt; and that there was no prospect of any income to support the operations of the community unless an administrator was appointed which justified the issue of the Notice. These were relevant considerations for the Registrar. For the reasons specified above I consider that the Registrar's decision was reached ' by a process of logical reasoning ': see Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161. I therefore reject Mutitjulu's Wednesbury submissions.</text>
