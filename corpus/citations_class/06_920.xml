<tocase>Dawson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 56 ALR 367</tocase>
<text>The general principle is that once a trial date is set, the trial should proceed. It was pointed out by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dawson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 56 ALR 367 at 370: 
 
 It is essential to the orderly conduct of the business of the court that trial dates be adhered to. When a case comes before the trial judge on the date fixed for trial, the parties are entitled to come to court with an assurance that the trial will commence and will proceed, so far as possible, without interruption, to its conclusion. The court, which is in this respect the protector of the public interest, is also entitled to that assurance. 
 (I also refer to another decision of that court Sarunic Brothers Pty Ltd v AFG Insurances Ltd , unreported Full Court Supreme Court of South Australia, 12 March 1984.)</text>

<tocase>The State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>However as pointed out by Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in The State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146 at 154: 
 
 Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim for a court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim.

In the submissions put to me yesterday it seems that, at least from the view point of the applicants, a considerable volume of material has been put to them days before trial. I note the claim of the respondents that most of the documents to which reference is made in the Schedule provided by the applicants to me in court yesterday were disclosed. The statements delivered during that time were made in response to the allegations of fraud made by the applicants. However, in view of the timing of delivery of this documentation and its considerable length (in particular the lengthy signed affidavit of the second applicant filed and served 12 July 2006 which in itself, including the annexures, totals 1685 pages) it appears at least from their submissions very difficult for the applicants to ascertain whether the documentation has been previously disclosed. I am not persuaded on the facts before me that the documents which have been delivered ought not to cause the applicants difficulty as urged by the respondents.

The position before me as of yesterday is that there appears to be a large volume of evidence which the applicant has either not had a proper opportunity to read and if necessary, respond to, or, possibly, evidence which is still not before the applicant.</text>
