<tocase>S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283</tocase>

<text>12 I accept the first respondent's submissions. In S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283 (" S58 ") a Full Court of this Court considered a similar claim. In S58 , as in the present case, the Tribunal had informed the visa applicant that it could not make a favourable decision solely on the basis of material then before it. The visa applicant's representative had then informed the Tribunal that the applicant would not appear at the hearing and the Tribunal should proceed "on the papers". The Tribunal proceeded with the hearing in the applicant's absence. In its reasons, the Tribunal had noted that, had the applicant appeared, it would have questioned him in some detail regarding certain documents and their contents. The applicant claimed that the Tribunal had breached procedural fairness by not informing him of its concerns about these documents. The Full Court, constituted by Ryan, Merkel and Conti JJ, held that there was no breach of procedural fairness. The Court said (at [25]): 
 
 "In the present case, the appellant was fully aware that the success of his application depended on an affirmative finding that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason if he were returned to Bangladesh. He was given an invitation to attend a hearing before the Tribunal which, apparently on advice, he deliberately declined. Having done so, he is to be taken to have assumed the risk that inconsistencies, omissions or other unsatisfactory features of his documents would be noted by the Tribunal without his having an opportunity to explain or clarify them." 

The Court concluded (at [26]) that "the appellant was offered the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and ... [h]e cannot complain if his application was rejected because, amongst other reasons, he failed to take up that opportunity".</text>

<text>13 Much the same principles apply in this case. Rather than request an adjournment, the appellant advised the Tribunal that he was not going to appear at the hearing. He cannot now complain that he was denied an opportunity to appear. The appellant says that he would have requested an adjournment if the Tribunal had informed him that it would have granted one. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the appellant did not request an adjournment. Moreover, the appellant implored the Tribunal to continue in his absence. There is no breach of procedural fairness in these circumstances: see further SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 per Jacobson J.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61</tocase>

<text>11 The first respondent submitted that there was no breach of s 426A or of natural justice. The first respondent noted that s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides that, if the applicant is invited to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear, then the Tribunal "may make a decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it". The first respondent claimed that the Tribunal invited the appellant to appear before it and that the record showed that the appellant had received this invitation and was aware of the date of the hearing. Further, the appellant had informed the Tribunal that he would not appear and had "implored" the Tribunal to continue in his absence. The first respondent argued that there is no breach of natural justice where the Tribunal proceeds in such circumstances. The first respondent also referred to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 at [66] and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 at [7] - [8] .</text>

<text>14 Further, I note that where the Tribunal decides to reschedule a contemplated hearing at the request of an applicant, s 425A does not apparently apply to the notice of the rescheduled hearing: see SZDQO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 and SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 494.

15 For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
 I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.
