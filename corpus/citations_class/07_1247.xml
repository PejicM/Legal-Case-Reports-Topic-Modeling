<tocase>Applicant S416 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2003] FCA 1630</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1630.html</AustLII>
<text>10 That proceeding before Madgwick J was a challenge by the appellant to a previous Tribunal's decision to affirm the delegate's decision not to grant him a protection visa. Justice Madgwick, on 5 December 2003, set aside that Tribunal's decision by consent, on the basis that certain country information which the Tribunal relied on was not brought to the appellant's attention, nor was he given a chance to comment on it. In Applicant S416 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2003] FCA 1630 ( Applicant S416 of 2003) , Madgwick J said at [3]: 
 
 
 There may well have been other reasons which the applicant would have wished to urge as to why the Tribunal Member's decision should be quashed. I am aware, for example, that certain material was sent to the authorities on a confidential basis, making serious allegations against the applicant. I upheld a claim for public interest immunity, made by the Minister, against a requirement that the relevant documents making allegations should be produced to the applicant's legal advisers. The nature of that material, it seems to me, was such that it might well give rise to a claim that if a Member of the Tribunal were to look at it and not show it to the applicant or apprise him of sufficient of the substance as to enable him to deal with it for fear of compromising the identity of the informant, among other things that could give rise to a claim of apprehended bias on the part of the Tribunal Member. It therefore seems to me that in order to forestall, so far as possible, any such dispute, it would be desirable upon the remitter of the matter to the Tribunal for re-consideration according to law that the President of the Tribunal should, with the benefit of legal advice, give the matter his consideration. (Emphasis added.)

11 The Federal Magistrate set out this paragraph of Madgwick J's judgment in Applicant S416 of 2003 [2003] FCA 1630 at [23] of his Honour's reasons and emphasised a passage commencing with the words "(t)he nature of that material" until the end of the paragraph.

12 The Federal Magistrate considered at [25] that "a fair-minded lay observer" would appreciate Madgwick J's warning offered to the Tribunal, but would also note that Madgwick J had left it to the Tribunal "to form its own judgment on how to deal with that material".

13 The Federal Magistrate said at [28]: 
 
 
 ...once the material did reach the Tribunal, it was the duty of the member constituting the Tribunal personally to consider its potential relevance, weight and usefulness. To allow another person to perform this assessment, would mean that the Tribunal, as properly constituted by a member designated under ss. 421 and 422, had failed to perform the "review" required by ss. 414 and 415.

14 The Federal Magistrate set out passages from the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal on 5 August 2004 at [33]. At those passages, the Tribunal: 
 
 
 &#8226; referred to the appellant's concern about the exempt documents unfairly influencing the Tribunal's decision;
 &#8226; said it could not go into much detail about the contents of the exempt documents;
 &#8226; said the accusations in them were "unsupported"; and
 &#8226; said it would not be taking them into account but would "put them aside".</text>

<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 222 ALR 411</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>17 In Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 222 ALR 411 ( VEAL ), the High Court considered the Tribunal's obligation to accord procedural fairness in circumstances where it was aware of allegations against a protection visa applicant and where the author of the information containing the allegations has requested it be confidential. In that case, the Tribunal did not inform the applicant about a letter containing allegations which were adverse to his application, but said in its reasons for decision that it gave the letter no weight. The High Court said the Tribunal should have told the applicant of the substance of what was said against him.

18 The Court said at [17]: 
 
 
 ...what is "credible, relevant and significant" information must be determined by a decision-maker before the final decision is reached. That determination will affect whether the decision-maker must give an opportunity to the person affected to deal with the information. ... "Credible, relevant and significant" must therefore be understood as referring to information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision.

19 In the instant case, the Tribunal informed the appellant prior to making its decision that it would not take the exempt documents into account. However, this does not mean that the Tribunal applied proper procedure in not telling the appellant the substance of the allegations and allowing him to comment.

20 In VEAL , the Court said at [20]: 
 
 
 The information set out in the letter about the appellant could not be dismissed from further consideration by the tribunal as not credible, or not relevant, or of little or no significance to the decision. 
 
 
 
 The Court considered the material to bear "upon whether [the appellant] had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason".

21 As discussed at [16], the Federal Magistrate said in his Honour's reasons for judgment at [36] that some of the material in the exempt documents was "potentially derogatory of...the credibility of [the appellant's] refugee claims". It may be logically considered that the material in the exempt documents bore directly on whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. It is immaterial that the Federal Magistrate was not satisfied the exempt documents had any influence on the Tribunal or whether it was probable that they did. The exempt documents were tendered, confidentially, on appeal. In my view, they had the potential to impact adversely on the credibility of the appellant's refugee claims.

22 Counsel for the Minister submitted that what is "credible, relevant and significant" material is a matter for the Tribunal alone and that a degree of latitude should be given to the Tribunal's views, in circumstances where it announces before making its decision that it will not take the material into account. However, counsel conceded that the Tribunal's view on the credibility, relevance and significance of material could be reviewed by a Court in circumstances where the material is, of its nature, so obviously credible, relevant and significant that a reasonable tribunal could not regard it as otherwise.

23 As indicated at [21], the exempt documents were tendered confidentially on the appeal. Having read them, I cannot fathom how any reasonable tribunal would not be influenced by them to form an adverse view of the appellant's credibility generally and in respect of his refugee claims. Some of the allegations raised in the exempt documents against the appellant are very serious.

24 In my view, no reasonable tribunal could consider that the documents were not "credible, relevant and significant". Some of the material in the exempt documents was supported by other parts of it. That impacts on its potential credibility. The exempt documents could not be divorced from an assessment of the appellant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. At the very least, they could not, by their nature, be reasonably dismissed as not bearing on the credibility of the appellant's refugee claims in a real and substantial way such that the material in them could be put to one side and out of the decision-maker's mind.

25 I note the Tribunal's decision preceded the High Court's judgment in VEAL [2005] HCA 72 ; 222 ALR 411 by about ten months. However, in accordance with VEAL [2005] HCA 72 ; 222 ALR 411 at [29] , the Tribunal, to accord procedural fairness to the appellant, should have informed him of the substance of the allegations made in the exempt documents and asked him to respond to them, or at the very least informed him of the substance of those parts of the exempt documents which bore on the credibility of his claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution, and asked him to respond. In failing to do so, the Tribunal failed to accord the appellant procedural fairness.

26 The decision of the Tribunal must be set aside and the matter remitted to a differently constituted Tribunal. The failure to accord the appellant procedural fairness having been established, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider whether the Tribunal's decision was affected by apprehended bias, as a consequence of it being aware of the allegations made against the appellant. There is no utility in examining this issue because if the matter is remitted to the Tribunal it will bring the substance of the exempt documents, which bear on the appellant's credibility, to his attention and no issue of apprehended bias should arise.

27 The Tribunal dealt with the appellant's claim to fear persecution on account of his political opinion at pp 9-27 of its decision record under the heading "Claims and Evidence". Essentially, the appellant claimed to be involved with and to support the Bangladesh National Party (BNP). At p 13, the Tribunal noted the appellant's claim that, in 1992, the BNP appointed him regional director of the AsiaNews Network Overseas (Network), which he described as "a joint venture between BNP and overseas supporters".</text>

<tocase>VWFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 231</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/231.html</AustLII>
<text>38 As Young J said in VWFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 231 ( VWFP ) at [62]: 
 
 
 In applying s 424A, it is necessary to focus on matters that, viewed prospectively, would be the reason or a part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision, or viewed retrospectively in the light of the Tribunal's actual decision, can be seen to be the reason, or a part of the reason, for the Tribunal's decision.

39 Justice Young also observed in VWFP at [62] that "...s 424A is concerned with information that is adverse to the interests of the visa applicant".

40 The reference letter was not adverse to the appellant's interests. It did not contradict material contained in the appellant's protection visa application. The reference letter was evaluated by the Tribunal for comparison with what the appellant said in his 1999 statement to the delegate. The Tribunal considered the reference letter did not support the appellant's assertion about the connection between the Network and BNP. The Tribunal did not state that the reference letter contradicted the claims made in his 1999 statement to the delegate but, rather, said that it did not support the claims. At this point in its decision-making, the Tribunal was doing no more than evaluating the evidence.

41 Under the heading "Findings and Reasons" in the decision record, the Tribunal did not rely on the reference letter in rejecting the appellant's claim that the BNP stood behind the Network. I agree with the submission of counsel for the Minister that the Tribunal considered it critical to this aspect of the appellant's claim that he was unable to provide evidence to support his claim. In that sense, the Tribunal relied on a lack of information in dismissing this claim of the appellant, rather than on any particular information. In my view, the Court below correctly determined that the Tribunal did not breach s 424A of the Act in coming to its decision.
 
 I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.
