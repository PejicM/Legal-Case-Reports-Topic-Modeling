<text>29 If, of course, there is simply no evidence to support the contended inconsistency, that becomes a relevant matter but in the face of an evaluation of the evidence and having had the benefit of seeing the appellant, the conclusions as to inconsistency were open to the Tribunal irrespective of whether another Tribunal may have reached, or this Court or another Court, may have reached a different conclusion. In Ex parte Durairajasinghan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423 at paragraph 67, McHugh J makes plain that findings of credibility are a matter for the Tribunal. His Honour observed:
 
 'However, this was essentially a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim. A finding on credibility is the function of the primary decision maker par excellence.'</text>

<text>30 Similar observations have been made as to those matters. In W148/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 185 ALR 703, the Full Court of the Federal Court, per Lee, Tamberlin and R.D. Nicholson JJ observed at [65]:
 
 'It is important to identify, in this case, the precise question for determination by the minister and the tribunal. The relevant question is whether the minister and the tribunal could be "satisfied" that the case for refugee status has been made out: see ss 65 and 415 of the Act. The High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259; per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ, considered this requirement of satisfaction and observed that the decision under review is of a subjective nature and is not the same as a review of an entirely objective determination of refugee status. This distinction underlies the need for care when viewing the decision of the tribunal, especially in relation to the question of credibility, because the review is as to the satisfaction of the minister or his delegate and not as to the determination of the minister or the delegate.'</text>
