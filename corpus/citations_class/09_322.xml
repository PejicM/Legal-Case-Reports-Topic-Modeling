<tocase>Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 291</tocase>
<text>As will be apparent from the judgment which I delivered a short time ago ( Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 291), my associate was notified yesterday afternoon that the applicant would seek leave to discontinue all of the claims previously made by it, with the exception of those set out in subparagraphs 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) of the Amended Application filed on 23 December 2008.

That intention had been communicated to the solicitors for the respondent somewhat earlier in a facsimile transmission dated 24 March 2009.

After I announced my decision on the disqualification application, Counsel for the applicant sought leave to discontinue the proceedings in the particular respects set out in the Notice of Discontinuance dated today, signed by Mr Whitehead and handed up to me. There is no opposition from the solicitor for the respondent to the leave to discontinue sought by the applicant being granted by me and I grant that leave. The Notice of Discontinuance may be filed in Court.</text>

<text>It will be remembered that, on 12 January 2009, when I delivered judgment on the applicant's interlocutory application ( Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Limited [2009] FCA 6) , I made an order for costs in respect of that application, the terms of that particular order being: 
 The applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the interlocutory hearing which took place before the Court on 23 December last.

I have been informed that no further evidence has been filed by either party since the last directions hearing which was held on 5 February 2009. This is not a matter of criticism, as it seems that the parties have been attempting to resolve the matter.

I think that costs to date will have been incurred in relation to three broad subject matters, namely: 
(1) Work done in relation to the interlocutory hearing;
 
(2) Work done on the balance of the proceedings (including the disqualification application but excluding the interlocutory hearing and excluding the Cross-Claim); and
 
(3) Work done in relation to the Cross-Claim.</text>
