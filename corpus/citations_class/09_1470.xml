<tocase>SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1198.html</AustLII>
<text>The appeal came on for hearing before Gordon J. On 2 September 2008, for reasons which her Honour then published, the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court was allowed. The matter was remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law: SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198.

On 19 February 2009, a differently constituted Tribunal decided to affirm the refusal decision made by the Minister's Delegate. The Appellants made a further judicial review application to the Federal Magistrates Court.

On 15 June 2009, for reasons given that day, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the Appellants' judicial review application. It is from that decision that the Appellants appeal once more to this Court.

The basis upon which the male Appellant claimed a protection visa was set out in a statement annexed to the visa application. In her judgment in the first appeal Gordon J offered (at [5]) the following summary of the basis of the claim, which I gratefully adopt: The first appellant was born in 1960. He claimed he owned and ran a freshwater fish farm in Fujian province near Fuqing city and that his life was uneventful until he was contacted by a distant cousin in August 2006. That cousin was in dispute with local authorities from Putian city over the alleged confiscation of his land and a failed promise by the government to deliver compensation to the landholders whose land had been confiscated. The first appellant claimed that at that time he gave this cousin a job working on his fish farm.
 In October 2006, the first appellant claimed that his cousin's brother (who had organised for local farmers near Putian city to protest about the confiscation of his land) had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau ("the PSB"). The first appellant's cousin was required to return to his hometown. The first appellant gave his cousin some money (10,000 Yuan) and a letter to a friend (Mr Zhou) whom the first appellant knew in Putian City, and who worked for the local government. The first appellant also telephoned Mr Zhou to plead for his help 'to save' the cousin's brother, who was soon released.
 The cousin and his brother continued to be embroiled in disputes with the local authorities over the land confiscation. On 11 November 2006, the first appellant was contacted by Mr Zhou who informed him that there had been a major conflict and that some farmers had been injured. Later that day the first appellant's cousin contacted him and told the first appellant that he and his brother were in hiding. The first appellant picked them up and took them to a 'secret place'.
 The next day (12 November 2006) the police attended the first appellant's farm and questioned him for two hours. The police came again five to six times, but they could not find anything. The first appellant told them nothing. The first appellant was scared and 'had to start applying' to go overseas for his own safety.
 The first appellant helped to arrange for the safe passage for his cousin and cousin's brother out of China to Taiwan on a fishing boat. However, the cousins were discovered by the navy and immediately arrested.
 The first appellant was concerned that he would be exposed by his cousins and immediately went to Guangzhou. On 17 December 2006, the first appellant left China from Guangzhou.
 The first appellant claimed that since leaving China the police have come to his home with an arrest permit on three occasions and he has been denounced as a protector of political dissidents. 
 The first appellant claimed he is on the blacklist of the PSB and will be arrested as soon as he returns to China. 
I have chosen to refer to the person whom her Honour has described as the "first appellant" in the passage quoted as the "male Appellant".

No different claim was made before the Tribunal on the second review hearing. However, as will be seen, the evidentiary foundation for that claim at that hearing differed in a crucial respect from that provided to the Tribunal at the time when it first reviewed the Minister's Delegate's visa refusal decision.

On this occasion, the Appellants advanced the following grounds of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: 
 
 Grounds 
 

 
 
 The Federal Magistrates erred in law.
 The Federal Magistrates was wrong in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") acted properly in its findings. 
 

 
 
 Particulars 
 

 
 
 The Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s 424A of the Act.
 The Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s 425 of the Act.
 The Tribunal failed to consider my claims properly and fairly. Tribunal made its finding actually based on unwarranted assumption; the Tribunal ignored or failed to consider a claim I made to it; the Tribunal ignored other relevant materials which was before it; and the Tribunal misunderstood my claim or made a mistake in relation to an important finding of fact. 
 

 
 
 [sic]

The so-called grounds of appeal are so vaguely stated as to be devoid of meaning. That position is not really ameliorated by the so-called particulars, which are noteworthy not only for their generality of expression but also for their failure to focus upon what is alleged to be error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court, as opposed to the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The learned Federal Magistrate (at para 7) had observed: "There was no obligation on the Tribunal to make a disclosure pursuant to s 424A in this case. That is because the Tribunal decision turned upon the applicants' own evidence, both oral and written." The reason assigned by the Tribunal accurately, if generally, describes what came to govern the fate of the Appellants' review application before the Tribunal. A more precise description was offered by the Minister in his submissions: "The Tribunal relied upon internal inconsistencies and inconsistencies in the oral evidence provided by the [male Appellant] to the differently constituted Tribunals". As the Minister correctly submitted, "such reliance does not invoke s 424A obligations": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190. There was no error in the learned Federal Magistrate's dismissal of the judicial review application insofar as it relied upon an alleged breach of s 424A of the Act by the Tribunal.

Subject to exceptions not presently relevant, s 425 of the Migration Act obliged the Tribunal to invite the Appellants to appear before it, "to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". The Tribunal extended such an invitation to the Appellants. They accepted that invitation and appeared before the Tribunal. The learned Federal Magistrate's description of and conclusion with respect to what then transpired was as follows (at para 11): 
 
 It is plain from the record of what occurred at the hearing that the Tribunal entertained serious credibility concerns about the first applicant's claims and his evidence. The Tribunal proceeded on a somewhat different basis than the delegate. The delegate's decision centred on the vagueness of the applicants' claims and the lack of supporting detail. The first applicant attempted to deal with that defect before the Tribunal by providing details, both orally and in the form of documents. The Tribunal did not accept either the plausibility of his evidence or the authenticity of his critical documents. I am satisfied from the detailed recitation of what occurred at the Tribunal hearing that the Tribunal put the applicants on notice of the essential and significant issues upon which the review would turn. 
 

On this basis, the learned Federal Magistrate concluded that the Appellants had been given a fair opportunity to present their case and expressed satisfaction that there had been no breach by the Tribunal of s 425 of the Migration Act .

It is evident from the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that the Appellants filed no written submissions in advance of the hearing and that the male Appellant made a general complaint about a lack of fairness attending the proceedings before the Tribunal.</text>

 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial.

<tocase>VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/158.html</AustLII>
<text>Leave to add a ground of appeal not raised below should only be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice so to do: VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] . Inevitably, whether or not to grant leave to add such grounds to the notice of appeal requires some exploration of their merits. For reasons which follow, that exploration persuades me that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Appellants should have leave to raise the grounds identified in para 24 above.

The consideration arising from the letter of 6 March 2007 which prompted me not to dismiss the appeal peremptorily but rather to adjourn the hearing so as to afford the Minister an opportunity to make further submissions and thereafter to reserve my decision arose from the words emphasised at the foot of the letter of 6 March 2007. It is evident on the face of this letter that, at least purportedly, it was created after the Appellants had both left China and lodged their protection visa application here, that it is referring to steps which have just been taken in light of recent events with which the male Appellant was concerned and that a duplicate of the letter is to be sent, materially, to him as well as to the addressees of the letter.

While, if genuine, the letter of 6 March 2007 does not corroborate the detail of the claim made by the Appellants, it does corroborate the claim in the general sense of confirming that the male Appellant had held a responsible position at the Aquatic Farm, had been involved in some sort of "dissident" activity and had, in so doing, come to the adverse attention of the People's Security Bureau (PSB). It is truly, in this sense, a "critical document".</text>

The implications of the judgments delivered in that case in relation to the judicial review of fact finding form the centrepiece of a valuable discussion by Aronson M, Dyer B, Groves M in their work, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4 th ed, Law Book Co, 2009) ( Judicial Review of Administrative Action ) at p 265 et seq on the subject "Challenging seriously irrational or illogical fact finding". While the whole of that discussion repays study in the present context, the following passage (at pp 271-273) is, in my opinion, particularly apposite: 
 
 Lee J dissented as to the result in WAHP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, but his Honour's statement of the relevant principles was not affected: 
 

 
 
 
 'The [Refugee Review] Tribunal obtains power to make a determination under the Act where the determination is based on findings or inferences of fact that are grounded upon probative material and logical grounds. A determination that is based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact may be shown to have no better foundation than an arbitrary decision and accordingly the review process will be unfair and will not have been conducted according to law. Here, of course, the words "irrational" or 'illogical' are used with their proper meaning of devoid of, or contrary to, logic; or ignorant or negligent of, and not in conformity with, the laws of correct reasoning, and are analogues of arbitrary or perverse. They are not sued with a lesser colloquial meaning that may be applied where the words are introduced in debate to emphasise the degree of dissent from a disputed conclusion or point of view. Illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact upon which a determination is based examinable as part of the matter that is subject to judicial review pursuant to the application for a prerogative or constitutional writ.' 
 
 

 
 
 The Federal Court accepts that whether a decision is sufficiently irrational to meet S20's standard 'will, in our view, always be a matter of degree", but it rejects the English approach to Wednesbury , which sets a more demanding standard of reasonableness where import human rights are at stake. Allsop J gave the following summary: 'There may be circumstances where the findings of fact are so irrational or capricious as to display a failure of the Tribunal to attend conscientiously and appropriately to its statutory obligations.' 
 

 
 
 [4.435] A real question now arises as to whether the courts will or should continue to stretch the procedural fairness rule of natural justice to accommodate a complaint that the decision-maker has made a serious factual mistake. It might be helpful to explore that question in the context of the House of Lords decision in R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board; Ex parte A . The board had disbelieved the applicant's story, without hearing directly from her or at all from the police doctor who had examined her. The police had encouraged the applicant to adopt a passive role, on the assurance that they would do everything necessary at the board hearing. However, the police grossly misrepresented the doctor's report, innocently as the House was prepared to assume. With no blame attaching to the board, their Lordships granted review on either of tow bases, namely, fundamental error of fact and breach of natural justice. Natural justice was their preferred ground, but Ex parte A has since been endorsed for its recognition of fact review. 
 

 
 
 If the English position does indeed allow review for fundamental error of fact, it goes considerably further than S20 , because such error can occur without procedural unfairness, irrationally or illogicalilty. We doubt that Australian common law will go that far. The High Court has doubted Ex Parte A's reasoning, at least so far as it was based upon natural justice, and quite possibly on the "error of fact" basis as well. The High Court suggested that Ex Parte A might be better analysed as involving a procedural error on the part of the police, thereby attracting review under ADJR's "procedural error" ground where ADJR applies.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/1192.html</AustLII>
<text>With all due respect to the Tribunal and in the sense they are used by Lee J, the adjectives "ignorant", "arbitrary" and "perverse" aptly apply to a process of reasoning which damns a man's credibility by reference, materially, to a false factual premise concerning a critical document. What follows from this, to take up sentiments voiced by Allsop J (in SZDFO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1192 at [10] ) in the passage I have quoted from Judicial Review of Administrative Action , is that the Tribunal has failed to attend conscientiously and appropriately to its statutory obligations and the Federal Magistrates Court has failed to apprehend this.

An alternative way of approaching matters is also exposed by the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action under the heading "Fact review by the imaginative uses of other grounds" (at p 273 et seq). While I should respectfully question the aptness of the descriptor, "imaginative", it is nonetheless, in my opinion, a denial of procedural fairness to a visa applicant for the Tribunal to subject him to questioning, upon the answers to which findings as to credibility come to be made, upon a false factual premise with respect to a critical document. That false premise is that the letter of 6 March 2007 was not addressed to him. In a narrow sense that is true but, reading the letter as a whole, it is plain on its face that he was an intended addressee insofar as the dispatch of duplicates was concerned.</text>

<tocase>Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1088</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>In their discussion of Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 ( Dranichnikov ) in the passage in their work to which I have drawn attention, the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action observe (at p 275) that this decision "has the effect of extending the procedural fairness rule to the situation where the decision-maker has substantially 'switched off' during an important phase of the pre-decisional process". I respectfully agree. That, with respect, is precisely what the Tribunal as constituted for the rehearing in this case did. To make that observation is not in any way to diminish the very real difficulty under which a tribunal dealing with an unrepresented layperson not fluent in English must labour when conducting a review on the merits but is to acknowledge that such a tribunal must nonetheless at least come to grips with the claim as made.

In a footnote (p 275, fn 606) in this part of their work the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action instance SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 238 ALR 611 ( SZIFI ) as a case which, even though Dranichnikov is not mentioned, offers a good example of the type of procedural fairness error for which they contend Dranichnikov stands. In SZIFI Greenwood J observed (at 614, [43]): 
 
 [43] Once it is established that the tribunal has asked itself the wrong question by, for example, asking whether it can be satisfied that the appellant faces a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China, or has identified the wrong issue, or taken into account, in one part of its deliberations, a notion that the appellant is an Indonesian rather than a Pakistani national, the tribunal is seen to have failed to provide the appellant with procedural fairness and thus jurisdictional error arises ( Refugee Review Tribunal and Another; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [59] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ). The repository of the power is constrained by an obligation to act reasonably by providing procedural fairness. A decision made in light of a failure to act reasonably is not a decision made under the Act for the purposes of s 474.

I do not accept that the basis for this type of jurisdictional error is as confined as the Minister has propounded or that regard to the cases cited bears this out. Rather, each of these cases offers but another example of a procedural fairness error on the part of the Tribunal in failing truly to engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant. That this is so is, in my opinion, starkly evident in the following passage from the joint judgment of Lee and Moore JJ in WAIJ (at 580, [53] [54]): 
 
 [53] It is a denial of a fair process to purport to dismiss documents from consideration where the material therein supports an applicant's case in substantive respects and no ground for such a course is provided by the documents on their face or by other facts.
 [54] It follows that the tribunal did not accord to the appellant practical fairness and justice in the tribunal's conduct of the review. Accordingly, the decision of the tribunal involved jurisdictional error and was not a decision authorised by the Act: see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ... at [24], [32] per Gummow and Callinan JJ. 
 

Here, the Tribunal has discounted the letter of 6 March 2007 on the basis of credibility findings concerning the male Appellant but these findings, in turn, are tainted by responses to questions put to the male Appellant at the hearing and subsequent reasoning, which questions and reasoning were each grounded in a false premise concerning that letter. Significantly, in WAIJ, Lee and Moore JJ each conceived that the procedural fairness they described gave rise to the same type of jurisdictional error as that found by the High Court in Dranichnikov .

In contrast to WAIJ , Dranichnikov is not expressly mentioned in the reasons of the majority (Madgwick J, Conti J agreeing) in NAJT . However, that part of those reasons in NAJT which upholds the allegation that there had been a jurisdictional error constituted by a failure on the part of the Tribunal to "have regard" to a corroborative letter (147 FCR at 92-93, [212] [213]) is consistent with the error found in Dranichnikov and with the classification by the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action of that error as a type of procedural fairness error. Further, the letter concerned in that case had not been completely ignored but rather the subject of "fleeting, uncritical references".</text>

<text>In a footnote (p 275, fn 606) in this part of their work the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action instance SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 238 ALR 611 ( SZIFI ) as a case which, even though Dranichnikov is not mentioned, offers a good example of the type of procedural fairness error for which they contend Dranichnikov stands. In SZIFI Greenwood J observed (at 614, [43]): 
 
 [43] Once it is established that the tribunal has asked itself the wrong question by, for example, asking whether it can be satisfied that the appellant faces a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China, or has identified the wrong issue, or taken into account, in one part of its deliberations, a notion that the appellant is an Indonesian rather than a Pakistani national, the tribunal is seen to have failed to provide the appellant with procedural fairness and thus jurisdictional error arises ( Refugee Review Tribunal and Another; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [59] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ). The repository of the power is constrained by an obligation to act reasonably by providing procedural fairness. A decision made in light of a failure to act reasonably is not a decision made under the Act for the purposes of s 474.</text>

<tocase>WAIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568</tocase>
<text>It was conceded on behalf of the Minister that jurisdictional error could be constituted by the Tribunal's overlooking of a relevant consideration but that to make this out it had to be demonstrated that a whole aspect of a visa applicant's case had been overlooked, not just a particular document. Examples of this were said to be found in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568 ( WAIJ ) and NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 ( NAJT ).

I do not accept that the basis for this type of jurisdictional error is as confined as the Minister has propounded or that regard to the cases cited bears this out. Rather, each of these cases offers but another example of a procedural fairness error on the part of the Tribunal in failing truly to engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant. That this is so is, in my opinion, starkly evident in the following passage from the joint judgment of Lee and Moore JJ in WAIJ (at 580, [53] [54]): 
 
 [53] It is a denial of a fair process to purport to dismiss documents from consideration where the material therein supports an applicant's case in substantive respects and no ground for such a course is provided by the documents on their face or by other facts.
 [54] It follows that the tribunal did not accord to the appellant practical fairness and justice in the tribunal's conduct of the review. Accordingly, the decision of the tribunal involved jurisdictional error and was not a decision authorised by the Act: see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ... at [24], [32] per Gummow and Callinan JJ. 
 

Here, the Tribunal has discounted the letter of 6 March 2007 on the basis of credibility findings concerning the male Appellant but these findings, in turn, are tainted by responses to questions put to the male Appellant at the hearing and subsequent reasoning, which questions and reasoning were each grounded in a false premise concerning that letter. Significantly, in WAIJ, Lee and Moore JJ each conceived that the procedural fairness they described gave rise to the same type of jurisdictional error as that found by the High Court in Dranichnikov .

In contrast to WAIJ , Dranichnikov is not expressly mentioned in the reasons of the majority (Madgwick J, Conti J agreeing) in NAJT . However, that part of those reasons in NAJT which upholds the allegation that there had been a jurisdictional error constituted by a failure on the part of the Tribunal to "have regard" to a corroborative letter (147 FCR at 92-93, [212] [213]) is consistent with the error found in Dranichnikov and with the classification by the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action of that error as a type of procedural fairness error. Further, the letter concerned in that case had not been completely ignored but rather the subject of "fleeting, uncritical references".</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 1123</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2009/39.html</AustLII>
<text>For the Minister, attention was appropriately and necessarily directed to the then pending decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 1123 ( SZIAI ), judgment in which came to be delivered on 23 September 2009. The outcome in that case served to underscore the correctness of the submission made on behalf of the Minister in the present case, which was that, though the Tribunal was a type of inquisitorial forum, it was not under any general duty to conduct inquiries of its own motion. Given the reasoning and outcome in SZIAI , it is not necessary to refer to the predecessor authorities which the Minister called in aid in support of that submission in the present appeal.

It was further submitted for the Minister that, insofar as the male Appellant had invited the Tribunal so to do, it did not follow from this that the Tribunal was bound to take up that invitation, although it was evident that the Tribunal had given the invitation due consideration. I agree that the mere extending by a visa applicant of an invitation to the Tribunal to conduct inquiries itself does not thereby convert a course of action that it would be permissible but not obligatory for the Tribunal to undertake into one which it is bound to undertake. Rather, the singular circumstances of a particular case may, exceptionally, give rise to an obligation on the part of the Tribunal in that case to make its own inquiry with respect to a critical fact. A failure so to do could in such a circumstance give rise to a conclusion that the Tribunal had failed to exercise the review jurisdiction consigned to it and thereby made a jurisdictional error: SZIAI at [25]. In allowing for the possibility of such a jurisdictional error the language employed in the joint judgment in SZIAI counsel's restraint in concluding that it is present, "a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained".

In practice, with respect, whether such restraint has been observed by a reviewing court may be controversial for, in cases at the margin, reasonable minds might reasonably differ as to whether a particular inquiry was "obvious". The present may well be a case in point. The Tribunal had before it evidence in the form of the Departmental file notes to which I have referred of the facility with which telephonic inquiries had been able to be made at the fish farm in respect of the male Appellant's employment status in relation to what must have been the routine processing student visa applications. Especially given the nature of the class of visa sought by the Appellants and the impact which it would have on an assessment as to whether the Tribunal was satisfied in the way the Migration Act required for the granting of such a visa, it does not seem to me a transgression of the restraint counselled in SZIAI to hold that the making of a telephonic inquiry of the fish farm as to whether there had been a forfeiture or confiscation of an interest which the male Appellant had at that farm or perhaps just as to why he was no longer employed there was an obvious inquiry about a critical fact.

As it happens, there are, for the reasons set out above, other bases upon which it is possible to conclude that the Tribunal's decision was tainted by jurisdictional error. However, this is also, in my opinion, one of those exceptional cases in which it is possible in the circumstances to conclude that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise the review jurisdiction consigned to it by s 414 of the Migration Act because it failed to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact.

For these reasons, the appeal must be allowed, the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal to hear and determine the review application according to law. For that purpose, the Tribunal should not be constituted by a member who has hitherto heard and determined that review application. I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
