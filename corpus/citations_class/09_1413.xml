<text>Again on 10 December 2008, in Sleep v Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 1101 , the AAT made the following decision: 
 
 The decision of the Repatriation Commissioner dated 13 August 2007, as affirmed by a decision of a review officer dated 19 March 2008, which reduced Mr Sleep's rate of pension from 26 August 2007, is affirmed.

It is from those two decisions that the applicant appealed to a judge of this Court pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). The appeals were heard together and the orders dismissing those appeals were made on 12 May 2009.

It was not until 3 September 2009 that the applicant made an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal. Even then one application only was made in respect of both matters.</text>
