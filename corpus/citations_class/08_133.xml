<text>4 The Tribunal did consider in some detail the question of the alleged membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal set out the tests to be applied in consideration of the determination and membership of a particular social group. It cited and applied the tests set out in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 and Applicant S v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387. It identified the claimed group as being ' Tamil persons who borrow monies from loan sharks in Malaysia ' or ' persons who borrow money from loan sharks ' or ' persons who are unable to repay debts to loan sharks '.</text>

<text>4 The Tribunal did consider in some detail the question of the alleged membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal set out the tests to be applied in consideration of the determination and membership of a particular social group. It cited and applied the tests set out in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 and Applicant S v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387. It identified the claimed group as being ' Tamil persons who borrow monies from loan sharks in Malaysia ' or ' persons who borrow money from loan sharks ' or ' persons who are unable to repay debts to loan sharks '.

7 The second issue raised by the appellant is whether the Tribunal formulated the correct test in determining whether there was in existence the claimed particular social group and whether the appellant feared persecution for that reason. It is not suggested that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in principle in its application of the test set out in Applicant S at [36] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The Tribunal took into account the High Court's characterisation of a particular social group and relevant country information. It found nothing to enable it to be satisfied that the activities complained of by the appellant would be other than one of many such criminal activities causing concern to the Malaysian authorities, as such activities cause concern in many countries.

8 The Tribunal concluded that none of the country information satisfied it that a social group similar to that suggested by the appellant would be ' identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group ' or that the relevant ' characteristic or attribute would distinguish the group from society at large ' in order for them to be a social group for the purposes of the Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant would be persecuted for reason of his membership of a particular social group.

9 The appellant has not demonstrated that the Tribunal applied the wrong test.</text>

<tocase>SZJDH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1561</tocase>

<text>2 The Tribunal's reasons set out in some detail the claims of the appellant and the material it considered in coming to its decision. The appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZJDH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1561) and to this Court raises the issue of the Tribunal's determination of the particular social group to which the appellant claimed he belonged. In his notice of appeal the appellant says that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to hold that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration being the failure, ' to discern convention reason with that convention reason being a particular social group '.

3 The way this ground has been framed in the appellant's written submissions is that he says that the Tribunal failed to discern the relevant Convention reason for his application. The appellant says that he belonged to a particular social group with that social group ' being group of persons who had dealings with loan sharks in Malaysia and who have been threatened by those loan sharks '. In his further written submissions the appellant characterised it as ' a person who had dealings with the loan sharks in who was unable to pay back the debts to the loan sharks '.</text>
