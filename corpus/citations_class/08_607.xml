<text>45 In Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202 Deane and Fitzgerald JJ outlined a series of propositions to be considered in assessing whether conduct is misleading or deceptive under s 52 of the Act:
 
&#8226; It is necessary to identify the relevant section(s) of the public by reference to whom the question of whether conduct is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive falls to be tested (ie to whom the conduct is directed, as subsequently addressed in Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 22 ; [2006] ATPR 42-106 at [34] ).
 
&#8226; Once the relevant section of the public is established, the matter is to be considered by reference to all who come within it, including the astute or the gullible, the intelligent or not so intelligent, educated or not educated and men and women of various ages and vocations (citing Puxu Pty Ltd v Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 73 at 93 per Lockhart J).
 
&#8226; Evidence that some individual has in fact formed an erroneous conclusion is admissible and may be persuasive, but is not essential. Regardless, such evidence does not itself conclusively establish the conduct to be misleading or deceptive, the test is objective and one the court must determine for itself. 
 
&#8226; It is necessary to inquire why any proven misconception has arisen (citing Hornsby Building Information Centre v Sydney Building Information Centre (1977) 140 CLR 216 at 228). It is only by this investigation that the evidence of those who are shown to have been led into error can be evaluated and it can be determined whether they are confused because of misleading or deceptive conduct on the part of the respondent.
When I discuss doctors, pharmacists and patients, it is in the context of these principles.

58 No reason has been advanced to sub-divide these groups into any sub-classes or areas of specialisation. The question is whether the advertisements would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct, or silence, has been directed. Where, as here, the representations are made to various classes of the public, the characteristics of the members of that class are relevant in order to determine whether a misconception is likely to arise from the conduct alleged ( Campomar at [98] [103]; Astrazeneca at [34]). The question is whether a not insignificant number of doctors, pharmacists or patients will be misled ( ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 380-381 per French J; National Exchange Pty Ltd v ASIC (2004) ATPR 42-000 at [70]). It is therefore necessary to assess the reactions or likely reactions of the members of each class to whom the conduct was addressed ( Campomar at [105]). The representations are to be tested by their effect on ordinary and reasonable persons within those groups ( Campomar at [102]).

79 It is not necessary for GenRx to establish that Ms Crisp, or anyone else, was actually misled or that she took steps consequent upon her misunderstanding ( Astrazeneca at [33]). However, it is relevant that Ms Crisp laboured under an erroneous assumption as to the substitutability of new Coversyl, arising from the use of the stamp issued by Servier and used by the prescribing doctor ( Astrazeneca at [36]; Taco Bell at 202). I am not satisfied that Ms Crisp's assumption was extreme or fanciful. To the contrary it was, for a busy pharmacist who dispenses numerous different drugs daily, a reasonable reaction on the part of an ordinary and reasonable pharmacist. The stamp did not simply cause confusion or wonderment ( Campomar at [106]), it misled Ms Crisp. It caused her to take remedial action, without which she would have continued to believe that brand substitution for Coversyl was not generally permitted. Accordingly, Ms Crisp laboured under an error ( Taco Bell ).

83 Mere confusion on the part of patients is not sufficient to establish a contravention of s 52 of the Act. Where there is no evidence of actual misleading, the question raised by the pleading is whether patients were or were likely to have been misled by the use of the stamp on patient prescriptions ( Campomar at [106]; Astrazeneca at [38]).

95 Doctors who read medical journals would be familiar with advertising for different drugs. The first banner advertisement would be recognised by doctors as an advertisement for Coversyl. Although it is in small type, there is an "elucidator" ( Astrazeneca ) that Servier has placed the advertisement. The statement "BRAND SUBSTITUTION NOT PERMITTED" appears directly next to the red box containing a tick and the exhortation "tick the box". The hypothetical ordinary or reasonable medical practitioner is familiar with the tickable box adjacent to the words "BRAND SUBSTITUTION NOT PERMITTED" appearing on standard prescription forms and its purpose. A doctor appreciates that he or she has the option to tick that box when writing a prescription for a specific brand of drug and that, if ticked, the pharmacist is not entitled as a matter of law to substitute another brand of drug for that which appears on the prescription form. A doctor reading the advertisement as a whole would know that Coversyl is a branded product which, without the exercise of the doctor's discretion to tick the box, can be substituted by "a"-flagged generics.

96 The first banner advertisement is an exhortation to tick the box and would be read as such. The doctor would associate the advertisement with the box on the standard form of prescription which he or she can decide to tick. He or she would understand that the advertisement was urging the doctor to tick that box as part of the completion of the prescription for Coversyl. I do not accept that it would be read or understood by a doctor to represent that brand substitution for Coversyl is never permitted or permissible. It does not say that the doctor cannot instruct that there be no substitution, or that the doctor is not permitted to allow substitution, or that "a"-flagging has not been or is not permitted. There is no suggestion of a Government or TGA source. The fact that the box is pre-ticked is not sufficient to suggest that a regulatory body has made a decision not to permit substitution.

97 There would be no need for an advertisement or for the doctor to tick the box if there was no "a"-flagged generic, or substitutable generic, drug for Coversyl. The advertisement does not represent that there are no substitutable drugs or that brand substitution is not permitted, in the sense that the doctor could not permit such substitution. Doctors would not be misled into thinking there is some regulatory bar to brand substitution for Coversyl.

110 In Astrazeneca the Full Court considered whether advertising flyers that were sent to general practitioners regarding a particular asthma medication were misleading or deceptive under s 52 of the Act. The flyers contained references to a clinical study and its results. The Court noted that in order to determine whether any breach of s 52 had occurred, it was necessary to determine whether the conduct would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the mind of that section of the community to whom the conduct was directed (at [34]; [37]). The Court noted that the representations in the advertisement were not made to identified individuals or to the public at large (at [35]) but to ' ordinary or reasonable members of the community of general practitioners throughout Australia ...'. The representations as claimed were not misleading or deceptive when viewed, in their entirety, as marketing documents directed to that class (at [24]; [42]). It can be assumed that the class of medical practitioners would, as in Astrazeneca , have some knowledge of clinical trials and that the class would accordingly view such material in a different fashion to the public at large.

111 I do not accept that the references to non-clinical factors would be understood by doctors as referring to regulatory matters. Doctors, by reason of education and experience, would understand that drugs are publicly available as a result of expenditure on research by innovator or originator companies. These are factors of importance to some medical practitioners (see [63]). GenRx submits that, although it is apparent that some of the reasons are not clinically based, doctors would be misled into thinking the reasons are ' reasonable or proper reasons to take into consideration when prescribing Coversyl '. They may be so led but it would not be misleading. Doctors are entitled, in their discretion, to take into account matters that are clinically related, although not specifically concerning the medication for that patient. For some ordinary and reasonable doctors, such as Drs Barlow, Ferrari, Flecker and Lambie, investment by originator companies in Australia and the undertaking of research, funded by profit on existing drugs, are important, reasonable and proper reasons for ticking the box to prevent generic substitution. Doctors would understand the factors of "investment in Australia", "all profit to research" and "patient and doctor support" as linked to the company that manufactures and sells Coversyl and not as factors relevant to regulatory decisions. They would understand that they were being asked to take those factors into account in forming the decision whether or not to tick the box on the prescription.

112 These representations, in the first whole page advertisement, are not misleading as alleged.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>56 The inquiry as to whether a representation to the public or a section of the public contravenes s 52 of the Act is a question of fact to be decided by considering what was said and done against surrounding circumstances ( Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45).

57 This is not a case of representations alleged to have been made to specific individuals. GenRx's case is that the representations in the printed stamp and in the advertisements are made to the public or a section of the public. A prescription written by a medical practitioner provides information to the pharmacist and to the patient for whom the prescription was written. The sections of the public to whom the stamp representations are directed are medical practitioners (doctors), pharmacists and patients who take or who are prescribed new Coversyl.

58 No reason has been advanced to sub-divide these groups into any sub-classes or areas of specialisation. The question is whether the advertisements would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct, or silence, has been directed. Where, as here, the representations are made to various classes of the public, the characteristics of the members of that class are relevant in order to determine whether a misconception is likely to arise from the conduct alleged ( Campomar at [98] [103]; Astrazeneca at [34]). The question is whether a not insignificant number of doctors, pharmacists or patients will be misled ( ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 380-381 per French J; National Exchange Pty Ltd v ASIC (2004) ATPR 42-000 at [70]). It is therefore necessary to assess the reactions or likely reactions of the members of each class to whom the conduct was addressed ( Campomar at [105]). The representations are to be tested by their effect on ordinary and reasonable persons within those groups ( Campomar at [102]).

79 It is not necessary for GenRx to establish that Ms Crisp, or anyone else, was actually misled or that she took steps consequent upon her misunderstanding ( Astrazeneca at [33]). However, it is relevant that Ms Crisp laboured under an erroneous assumption as to the substitutability of new Coversyl, arising from the use of the stamp issued by Servier and used by the prescribing doctor ( Astrazeneca at [36]; Taco Bell at 202). I am not satisfied that Ms Crisp's assumption was extreme or fanciful. To the contrary it was, for a busy pharmacist who dispenses numerous different drugs daily, a reasonable reaction on the part of an ordinary and reasonable pharmacist. The stamp did not simply cause confusion or wonderment ( Campomar at [106]), it misled Ms Crisp. It caused her to take remedial action, without which she would have continued to believe that brand substitution for Coversyl was not generally permitted. Accordingly, Ms Crisp laboured under an error ( Taco Bell ).

83 Mere confusion on the part of patients is not sufficient to establish a contravention of s 52 of the Act. Where there is no evidence of actual misleading, the question raised by the pleading is whether patients were or were likely to have been misled by the use of the stamp on patient prescriptions ( Campomar at [106]; Astrazeneca at [38]).</text>

<text>58 No reason has been advanced to sub-divide these groups into any sub-classes or areas of specialisation. The question is whether the advertisements would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct, or silence, has been directed. Where, as here, the representations are made to various classes of the public, the characteristics of the members of that class are relevant in order to determine whether a misconception is likely to arise from the conduct alleged ( Campomar at [98] [103]; Astrazeneca at [34]). The question is whether a not insignificant number of doctors, pharmacists or patients will be misled ( ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 380-381 per French J; National Exchange Pty Ltd v ASIC (2004) ATPR 42-000 at [70]). It is therefore necessary to assess the reactions or likely reactions of the members of each class to whom the conduct was addressed ( Campomar at [105]). The representations are to be tested by their effect on ordinary and reasonable persons within those groups ( Campomar at [102]).

130 Ordinary and reasonable doctors so misled would not be insignificant in number or proportion. I am not satisfied that ordinary and reasonable doctors, including general practitioners not specialised in hypertension and the mechanisms of blood pressure regulation, would generally have been aware of the Europa study and so discount the message otherwise conveyed by the advertisement, as did Drs Barlow and Ferrari. Indeed, Dr Flecker acknowledged that doctors might have thought that Coversyl was only listed in relation to its previously established indication of hypertension. The fact that some doctors reading the advertisement might be aware of the Europa trial and its results, or were otherwise aware that perindopril erbumine had been indicated both for hypertension and for stable coronary artery disease since 2003, does not preclude the statements in the second whole page advertisement being misleading ( ConAgra at 543 per French J).

131 It follows that the representation conveyed by the second whole page advertisement is misleading or likely to mislead doctors in its reference to "now indicated for stable coronary artery disease". By linking that statement to perindopril arginine, the advertisement represents that perindopril erbumine is not so indicated. That also amounts to a misrepresentation, as perindopril erbumine has been so indicated since 2005.

132 Servier has undertaken not to place for publication any advertisement which contains the words "Now indicated for stable coronary heart disease" or any substantially similar phrase which contains the word "now", until determination of this matter.</text>

<tocase>GenRx Pty Limited v Les Laboratoires Servier (2007) 71 IPR 606</tocase>
<text>51 After GenRx sought interlocutory relief in these proceedings ( GenRx Pty Limited v Les Laboratoires Servier (2007) 71 IPR 606) , Servier undertook not to distribute the stamp further and has issued to doctors a second form of stamp. The text of that stamp, about which GenRx does not complain, is:

52 In the pleading, GenRx alleges that the stamp, when used on patient prescriptions, conveys the following express or implied representations ('the stamp representations'):
 
1. Brand substitution not permitted for COVERSYL.
 
2. &#945;Brand substitution not permitted for COVERSYL.
 
3. Brand substitution for New COVERSYL is never permissible. 
 
4. There are no other perindopril products substitutable with New COVERSYL.

53 GenRx submits that the stamp conveys an impression of a bulk, blanket prohibition on substitution for Coversyl. That impression, GenRx submits, is reinforced by the use of the passive voice in the stamp. In that regard GenRx contrasts the second stamp, which uses the active voice and makes it clear that it is the doctor's decision not to permit substitution. GenRx accepts that Servier is entitled to attempt to persuade doctors to tick the box. However, GenRx submits, in the stamp and in each advertisement Servier has represented that there is some regulatory prohibition on generic substitution of Coversyl. GenRx submits that those seeing the stamp will be misled into thinking the stamp, with a pre-ticked box, comes from a regulatory body such as the TGA. GenRx says that the stamp therefore represents that there is a regulatory reason why there can be no substitution for Coversyl and that doctors who accept this will use the stamp to convey that message to the pharmacist.</text>

<tocase>Janssen Pharmaceutica Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd (1985) 6 IPR 227</tocase>
<text>149 At the hearing GenRx did not address ss 53 or 55 of the Act except to point out two matters. First, that subs 53(c) uses the word "benefit" and prohibits representations that ' represent that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits they do not have '. Secondly, that the classes of alleged misleading conduct include a representation that the product has a difference where, it submits, any such difference is not a distinction of significance and is accordingly not a benefit ( Janssen Pharmaceutica Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd (1985) 6 IPR 227). No further submissions in relation to these matters and no other submissions in relation to these sections were made by GenRx or by Servier.

150 No submissions were directed to the other criteria in those sections. No submissions were made as to whether, if Servier were found to have contravened s 52, it would follow that subs 53(a) and (c) or s 55 would also have been contravened. Accordingly, I do not propose to deal further with these allegations.

151 For convenience and in summary, the conclusions to which I have come are as follows:
 
&#8226; The stamp issued by Servier to doctors to be printed on prescriptions for Coversyl contains representations that are misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead pharmacists and patients within s 52 of the Act. The stamp representations are not likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners. 
 
&#8226; Servier is liable for the stamp representations and has thereby contravened s 52.
 
&#8226; The first banner advertisement representations are not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners.
 
&#8226; The first whole page advertisement caused to be published by Servier contains a representation as to improved stability that is likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners, within s 52 of the Act. Servier has thereby contravened s 52.
 
&#8226; The second whole page advertisement caused to be published by Servier contains a representation in relation to the indication for Coverysl for stable coronary artery disease that is likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners, within s 52 of the Act. Servier has thereby contravened s 52.
 
&#8226; The second banner advertisement representations are not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive medical practitioners.</text>

<text>88 Servier distributed the stamp as part of its campaign to have prescriptions issued that would not permit pharmacists to substitute generic perindopril products for new Coversyl. The message on the stamp was devised by Servier. There can be no dispute that, in distributing the stamp and placing the advertisements, Servier tried to influence doctor's prescribing of perindopril compounds. Servier's suggestion that its responsibility is limited to the distribution of the stamp, unused and closed, is untenable. The stamp was clearly provided for use and intended by Servier to be used to print the text of the stamp and to communicate such representations as it conveys. The language of the stamp was devised by Servier. Servier seeks to avoid liability for the representations conveyed by the stamp as used. It cannot do so. The stamp was given to doctors by Servier's representatives who urged doctors to use it. Servier is directly liable for the misleading representations by putting the stamp into circulation in circumstances where it was intended to be used ( Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 30 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 ; Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (No 2) (2006) 70 IPR 574).</text>

79 It is not necessary for GenRx to establish that Ms Crisp, or anyone else, was actually misled or that she took steps consequent upon her misunderstanding ( Astrazeneca at [33]). However, it is relevant that Ms Crisp laboured under an erroneous assumption as to the substitutability of new Coversyl, arising from the use of the stamp issued by Servier and used by the prescribing doctor ( Astrazeneca at [36]; Taco Bell at 202). I am not satisfied that Ms Crisp's assumption was extreme or fanciful. To the contrary it was, for a busy pharmacist who dispenses numerous different drugs daily, a reasonable reaction on the part of an ordinary and reasonable pharmacist. The stamp did not simply cause confusion or wonderment ( Campomar at [106]), it misled Ms Crisp. It caused her to take remedial action, without which she would have continued to believe that brand substitution for Coversyl was not generally permitted. Accordingly, Ms Crisp laboured under an error ( Taco Bell ).</text>
