<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 228 CLR 566</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/50.html</AustLII>
<text>29 As noted earlier, the applicant came to have his transitional (permanent) visa by operation of reg 4 (1) of the Transitional Provisions Regulations, which provided: 
 
 Subject to regulation 5, [which is not relevant in these proceedings] if, immediately before 1 September 1994, a non-citizen was in Australia as the holder of a permanent entry permit, that entry permit continues in effect on and after 1 September 1994 as a transitional (permanent) visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia. 

The explanatory statement to the Transitional Provisions Regulations stated that reg 4 was "designed to ensure that, from 1 September 1994, all visas and entry permits held immediately before that date [were] converted into one of two transitional visa classes by operation of law". The validity of reg 4(1) of the Transitional Provisions Regulations was upheld by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 228 CLR 566 at [23] [28].

30 The Transitional Provisions Regulations were made pursuant to s 40 and s 42 of the 1992 Reform Act (see the discussion in Nystrom at [26]). Relevantly, s 40(5) and s 40(6), provided: 
 
 (5) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, visas or permits in a specified Principal Act class and held by specified persons immediately before that date are to continue in effect as visas in a specified amended Act class. 
 (6) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, specified persons are to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified amended Act class. 
 

Paragraph 42 of the explanatory memorandum to the 1992 Reform Bill provides an explanation as to the anticipated effect of s 40(5) and s 40(6):
 
 The clause [i.e. the relevant clause of the Migration Reform Bill 1992 which introduced proposed s 40(5) and s 40(6)] also provides that regulations may continue in force visas or entry permits of specified classes which were held immediately before the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas. Related to this provision, the regulations may also deem specified persons to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified class created after the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas.

31 The import of s 40(5) and s 40(6) appears to be that the regulations made pursuant to those provisions may differentiate between visas or permits that are deemed to "continue in effect" as at 1 September 1994, and visas that have been deemed to have been "granted" to a person as at 1 September 1994. Indeed, and in contradistinction to reg 4.01, reg 9 of the Transitional Provisions Regulations provides that the holders of particular types of visas are deemed to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa on 1 September 1994. As reg 9 states: 
 
 A non-citizen who, immediately before 1 September 1994, held an old visa of the kind known as: 
 (a) an Authority to Return; or 
 (b) a Return Endorsement; 
 is taken, on 1 September 1994, to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa permitting the holder: 
 (c) to travel to and enter Australia within 3 years after each departure from Australia; and 
 (d) to remain indefinitely in Australia.

32 An important element in the applicant's case was that the Minister's power to cancel under the then s 180A (now s 501) of the Principal Act was restricted to visas and entry permits that had been "granted" to persons (and not acquired by operation of law) and this manifested a deliberate choice. This proposition is said to be apparent from the temporal proximity between the enactment of the Offences and Undesirable Persons Act and the enactment of the 1992 Reform Act, which as noted earlier, created a distinction between visas that are taken to have been granted and visas that are deemed to continue in effect.</text>

<tocase>Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 415 ; (2000) 97 FCR 387</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/415.html</AustLII>
<text>16 Reference was made to the decision of Finkelstein J in Hall v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 415 ; (2000) 97 FCR 387 at 394, where his Honour observed (at [29]): 
 
 ... the power to cancel a visa that is conferred by s 501(2) should, in my opinion, be construed to allow the cancellation of a permit to remain in Australia, which by force of the transitional provisions continues in force as a visa. That is, because permission to remain in Australia granted before the Migration Reform Act continues in force as a visa, it may be cancelled as a visa. Any other construction would result in the absurd position that a non-citizen who constitutes a danger or threat to the Australian community by reason of his or her past criminal conduct could not be removed from Australia. 

To similar effect were the observations of Kiefel J in Andary v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1380 at [7] where her Honour said that a transitional (permanent) visa 'was liable to cancellation'.</text>

<tocase>Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236</tocase>
<text>12 Support for the applicant's contention can be found in the decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236 at 246, where a Full Court observed that the power conferred on the Minister to cancel a visa under s 501 only applies to visas that have been granted to a person. Where a visa has been granted to a person, s 501F(3) operates so that any other visa held by that person is cancelled. On this basis, where an absorbed person visa is cancelled, a transitional (permanent) visa held by that person is also cancelled. However, the Full Court indicated that this process could not operate in reverse. It will be necessary to say something more about this judgment later in these reasons.

13 The applicant also submitted that he had not "ceased to be an immigrant" prior to 2 April 1984, and hence has never held an absorbed person visa as contemplated by s 34 of the Principal Act. If so, it was submitted, the applicant is not the holder of an absorbed person visa and is the holder of only one visa, a transitional (permanent) visa, which cannot be cancelled.

14 The Minister submitted that there is no basis for treating the word "granted" in s 501(2) as limiting the cancellation power in the way submitted by the applicant. "Granted", in the context of s 501(2), encompasses any means by which a person is given or acquires a visa. The word "granted", as it appears in s 501(2), should be read as encompassing any means of giving under the law, including giving by statute as well as giving by administrative decision. Indeed, the purpose of the language in question ("granted to a person"), it was submitted, is to distinguish s 501(2), which concerns the cancellation of visas that are already in effect, from s 501(1), which concerns a refusal to grant visas on character grounds. For the purposes of s 501(2), what is significant is that the person has a visa and not the means by which that visa was acquired.

34 It is necessary to say something more about the Full Court judgment in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The observations of the Full Court in [42]-[45] of their reasons entail a fairly unequivocal statement that a power to cancel a visa "that has been granted" would not be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa because that type of visa had not been "granted" or could not be taken to have been granted. However these observations do not, in my opinion, form part of the ratio of the decision. The observations were made in a passage in which the Full Court was discussing ground one in the appeal. At [39], the Full Court indicated that two questions arose in the consideration of ground one. The first was whether the appellant could be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa (which depended on whether he had been absorbed into the Australian community). The second was if he had not obtained an absorbed person visa, had the Minister effectively cancelled his transitional (permanent) visa. At [60] the Full Court concluded that the appellant had been absorbed into the Australian community well before to April 1984. The Full Court then concluded that the appellant held an absorbed person visa which was taken to have been granted to him. In the result, it was a visa which had been "granted" and one the Minister was empowered to cancel. It does not appear to me that this chain of reasoning necessarily depended on a conclusion that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa which had not been granted.

35 Nonetheless, even though these observations do not form part of the ratio of the decision in Moore , it is necessary for me, as a single judge, to give them significant weight. However, I am firmly convinced that the power to cancel conferred by s 501 was intended to be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa. In this case, the applicant held such a visa because he had been originally granted an entry permit. When s 180A was enacted in 1992, the applicant held an entry permit that had been granted. That permit could have been cancelled by exercise of the power conferred by s 180A. The removal of the reference to a power to cancel "a valid entry permit that had been granted" occurred at a time when, by the combined effect of legislative amendments and the promulgation of regulations, visas became the sole means of conferring a right to remain lawfully in Australia.

36 It is inconceivable, in my view, that the amendments made in 1994 to s 180A were intended to render immune from the power to cancel, an entry permit which had been transmogrified into a transitional (permanent) visa. The power conferred by what was then the renumbered s 501 was plainly intended to authorise the Minister to cancel whatever visa was held by a person who the Minister thought ought no longer be able to remain in Australia having regard to that person's character. Obviously I am not concerned here with the appropriateness of the underlying policy or the way in which the power has been exercised in this or any other case. However, I have no doubt the power is intended to be exercisable in relation to any visa and the words "that has been granted" were not intended to condition or limit the power. These words remained as the truncated residue of the formulation first appearing in s 180A, namely "a valid visa or a valid entry permit that has been granted".

37 In my opinion, the Minister had power to cancel the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa. I order that the period within which the applicant is to file his application be extended, and the application be dismissed with costs. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.
