<text>In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Pt 9 of the Act, the Court has a discretion to refuse a scheme or confirm it with or without modification (s 194). Confirmation of a scheme pursuant to s 194 is not a mere formality ( ANZ Life Assurance Company Limited and ING Life Limited [2005] FCA 806 at [4] ). The Court must have regard to the object of protecting the interests of policy holders ( Re Royal at [3]). It must ensure that the scheme will not be prejudicial to the interests of policy holders and that policy holders are properly safeguarded ( NULIFE Insurance Ltd v Norwich Union Life Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 1635 at [24] ).</text>

<tocase>Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 160</tocase>
<text>I did not consider that delay to be fatal to the applications ( Re Royal at [18]; Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 160 at 162). The Notices were published in New South Wales in three other approved newspapers prior to the public inspection period. Public inspection of the schemes was also extended in New South Wales from 8 September 2006 to 12 September 2006 to compensate for the delay in publication in the Daily Telegraph . For these reasons, I was satisfied that the delay did not adversely affect policy holders.</text>

<text>The principal object of the Act is to protect the interests of owners and prospective owners of life insurance policies in a manner consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative life insurance industry (s 3(1)). One means adopted to achieve this objective is the regime in Pt 9 of the Act for supervision of the transfer or amalgamation of life insurance businesses by the Court (s 3(2)(f) ; Re Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 ; (2000) 104 FCR 37 at [3] ).

In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Pt 9 of the Act, the Court has a discretion to refuse a scheme or confirm it with or without modification (s 194). Confirmation of a scheme pursuant to s 194 is not a mere formality ( ANZ Life Assurance Company Limited and ING Life Limited [2005] FCA 806 at [4] ).

For these reasons, I was satisfied that the delay did not adversely affect policy holders.

Copies of the schemes and the actuaries' reports were provided to APRA in accordance with the Act and the Regulations. APRA is a significant participant in proceedings for confirmation of a scheme ( Re Royal [24]). It informed the Court that it has no objection to the implementation of either scheme. That was a factor of material significance in the exercise of the Court's discretion to confirm the schemes under s 194 of the Act ( The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd [2003] FCA 637 at [13] ).

Significantly, the costs of the schemes will not be borne by policy holders.

Lifetime and National will continue to exist after the schemes are implemented and have given undertakings to the Court to maintain their current telephone and email addresses for at least 12 months.</text>
