<tocase>CBFC Ltd v Sim [2006] NTSC 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nt/NTSC/2006/57.html</AustLII>
<text>On 3 August 2006, reasons for the orders made on 10 July 2006 were published: CBFC Ltd v Sim [2006] NTSC 57.

This application under s 60(1) of the Bankruptcy Act was made immediately following the learned Supreme Court judge delivering reasons for the orders made on 10 July 2006. It seeks a stay of the proceedings in the NTSC, and a discharge of the orders made on 10 July 2006 including the warrant for Mr Sim's arrest.

Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act relevantly provides: 
 
 
 '60(1) The Court may, at any time after the presentation of a petition, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) discharge an order made, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, against the person or property of the debtor under any law relating to the imprisonment of fraudulent debtors and, in a case where the debtor is imprisoned or otherwise held in custody under such a law, discharge the debtor out of custody; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) stay any legal process, whether civil or criminal and whether instituted before or after the commencement of this subsection, against the person or property of the debtor: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) in respect of the non-payment of a provable debt or of a pecuniary penalty payable in consequence of the non-payment of a provable debt;

<tocase>Storey v Lane [1981] HCA 47 ; (1981) 147 CLR 549</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/47.html</AustLII>
<text>Because there is extant a creditor's petition for the making of a sequestration order against the estate of Mr Sim, there is no doubt that the Court has jurisdiction under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act : see Storey v Lane [1981] HCA 47 ; (1981) 147 CLR 549.



In my view the Absconding Debtors Act is a law to which s 60(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act refers.

In my view, s 60 is directed to legislation which is intended to protect a creditor or creditors within a particular jurisdiction from adverse consequences of a debtor leaving the jurisdiction prior, or after, to the making of a sequestration order. Section 4(3)(c) of the Absconding Debtors Act indicates that the Absconding Debtors Act falls within that description. Those consequences may be the result of deliberate wrongful conduct by the debtor, or (as here) by innocent conduct of the debtor. The purpose of the law under which imprisonment may be imposed is the important feature, because s 60 is intended to provide relief in certain circumstances against the means of enforcement of a debt which is not consistent with the Bankruptcy Act: see Storey v Lane .</text>

<tocase>Commissioner for Motor Transport v Train [1972] HCA 62 ; (1972) 127 CLR 396</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1972/62.html</AustLII>
<text>One consequence of that decision was that the decision of Gibbs J (as a judge of the Court of Bankruptcy) in Re Hollis (1968) 15 FLR 386 was overruled. That decision concerned the Road Act. That it was overruled is not immediately significant. What is significant in that decision, in my view, are comments of Gibbs J about the operation of the then form of s 60(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. His Honour at 388-389 regarded s 60(1) as being directed to legislation which, by imprisonment and other orders, was a means of enforcing the payment of the debt. See also per Gibbs J in Re Caddies; Ex parte Stapleton (1962) 19 ABC 155 at 158. I do not think that either Barwick CJ or Stephen J in Train necessarily disagreed with those comments. They provide a different focus for determining whether the Absconding Debtors Act is a law relating to the imprisonment of fraudulent debtors.

The Absconding Debtors Act is clearly directed to the enforcement, or the better enforcement, of the payment of a debt. It is perhaps surprising that legislation permits the issue of a warrant to arrest a debtor, to better secure the enforcement of a debt in the light of the trend evident even in the nineteenth century to abolish the practice of enforcement of payment of debt by imprisonment. The review of Australian legislation by Walsh J in Train indicates that trend. See also per Barwick CJ in Train at 402. The general approach of Gibbs J in Re Hollis to the scope of operation of s 60(1) of the Bankruptcy Act seems more consonant with its purposes, and with the role of the Bankruptcy Act as regulating the relations between a creditor and a debtor once the processes for which it provides are invoked.</text>

<tocase>Malouf v Prentice [1998] FCA 1427</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1998/1427.html</AustLII>
<text>More importantly, I consider his initial imprisonment in Australia, and then his forced residence in the Territory, are not consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Act. Its policy in relation to such matters is indicated by s 78 (referred to above), and the learned judge found that Mr Sim's desire to return to Indonesia was not with a view to avoiding payment of his debts but for legitimate purposes. See also s 272 of the Bankruptcy Act. I note that, if a sequestration order is made, a bankrupt must then surrender his or her passport to the trustee: s 77. Permission to travel overseas from the trustee then becomes necessary. A decision of the trustee on such a matter is reviewable. In Malouf v Prentice [1998] FCA 1427 Sackville J said the withholding of permission to travel for apparently legitimate purposes should not be lightly exercised. In Re Tyndall (1977) 17 ALR 182, Deane J at 187 and 190 referred to the 'fundamental importance' of such applications for permission to travel overseas to pursue legitimate commercial or personal desires; and also in some cases to the financial rewards to be derived by the bankrupt's estate.</text>

<text>I have not overlooked the expense which CBFC and the CBA have clearly incurred in the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors Act . It was their choice to bring those proceedings. They did so to take advantage of the different, and lower, threshold for a warrant for arrest under the Absconding Debtors Act . They did so in the light of the risk of Mr Sim applying for an order under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act. That he did not bring this application earlier no doubt has increased the costs they have incurred, and that is a factor I have put into the balance. But I do not consider his defence of the proceedings in the NTSC involved him acting in a manner consistent only with Mr Sim having chosen not to exercise his right to apply under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act, either generally or in the light of the reasons for judgment: cf Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394. There is also no evidence from CBFC or from the CBA that they continued to conduct the proceedings under the Absconding Debtors act relying upon any assumption of fact induced by Mr Sim's continued defence of those proceedings.

One matter which counsel for CBFC and the CBA raised, which I reject, is that there was insufficient opportunity to make an application to this Court or to the FMC for an order under s 78 of the Bankruptcy Act at or immediately after the hearing of the petition, and so the application was made under the Absconding Debtors Act . The Registry of this court is open during normal hours and has an after-hours number. It is well known that a judge of the Court can be available at very short notice, if necessary, to hear any urgent application. That is not to say that it was inappropriate to have instituted the proceedings in the NTSC under the Absconding Debtors Act that was a matter for CBFC and the CBA but simply to reject one explanation for having done so. The reason for having done so, as appears from the transcript of the hearing in the SCNT and in his Honour's reasons at [63], is the judicial advantage under the Absconding Debtors Act compared to s 78 of the Bankruptcy Act that, as his Honour accepted, the Absconding Debtors Act does not require proof that Mr Sim was about to abscond with a view to avoiding payment of his debts. However, as I have sought to point out, that judicial advantage also illustrates a difference from the policy of the Bankruptcy Act in circumstances such as the present.

Another matter raised by counsel for CBFC and the CBA which I reject is that Mr Sim has improperly delayed in making this application. In fact, he did so within a day of the reasons for judgment of the SCNT being published. As the factual issues before his Honour included whether Mr Sim did intend to abscond so as to avoid paying his debts, it was sensible for Mr Sim to await the reasons to see what factual finding was made on the issue.

I have also had regard to Mr Sim's preparedness to undertake to the Court to return to Australia (by inference within a reasonable time) to assist his trustee in the event that he is made bankrupt. He is prepared to offer a surety for his return, Thomas Winter, in the sum of $15,000 and Mr Winter too has deposed to his preparedness to offer that surety and to his having assets sufficient to meet it. I propose to accept that undertaking, but to impose upon Mr Sim the time limit of three calendar months from this date, or such later date as may be agreed in writing by his trustee. He will, upon his return to Australia, have to surrender his passport to his trustee. His trustee, assuming Mr Sim is made bankrupt, will then have sufficient time to investigate Mr Sim's affairs in such manner as the trustee may consider appropriate, and to arrange for Mr Sim to be examined under s 81 of the Bankruptcy Act. The trustee will control Mr Sim's capacity to travel overseas so as to allow an adequate time to complete with Mr Sim such inquiries as he wishes. I am more disposed to accept that undertaking, supported by the surety, as Mr Sim has extensive family in Australia: an elderly parent, three children and seven grandchildren.

Finally, I note (largely by way of an aside) that the Chief Minister on 22 November 1978 said of the Absconding Debtors Bill: 
 
 '[I]t is really only a power that is exercised when the person will not comply with the order of the court. It is virtually imprisonment for contempt of the court's orders, not imprisonment for debt.' 
 

(Northern Territory, Parliamentary Debates, 22 November 1978, p 428-432).

As the decision in the NTSC indicates, the power is exercisable in much wider circumstances, but for that reason its exercise may be vulnerable to an order under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act.

For those reasons, I order under s 60(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act that upon the written undertaking of Mr Sim to the Court to be filed in a form approved by the District Registrar that, in the event that a sequestration order is made against his estate, he will return to Australia within three calendar months of the making of the sequestration order and will cooperate with his trustee in respect of all inquiries and procedures which his trustee requires in relation to his bankruptcy, and upon Thomas Harry Edward winter providing to and filing in the Court a surety in the sum of $15,000 in a form approved by the District Registrar to the effect that, in the event that Mr Sim does not fully comply in every respect with his undertaking, Mr Winter will forfeit to the Crown the sum of $15,000, and that process may be executed against his property for the said sum of $15,000, the orders of the NTSC made on 10 July 2006 and extended on 4 August 2006 under the Absconding Debtors Act in respect of Mr Sim be discharged.</text>
