<tocase>Agro Holdings Ltd v Flexi-Coil (Australia) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1658</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1658.html</AustLII>
<text>53 This case is pleaded against Global and In Touch. The ACCC alleges that upon an examination of each of the pleaded franchising agreements, the evidence of the systems and marketing plans adopted, the commercial symbols used and the payments made by the distributors, these agreements constitute franchising agreements within the plain meaning of cl 4 of the Franchising Code (the requirements of cl 4 are cumulative: Agro Holdings Ltd v Flexi-Coil (Australia) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1658 at [36] ). The exception was the agreement with Smith as the performance of the agreement was to take place in New Zealand and therefore does not fall within cl 4.</text>

<text>55 These obligations imposed by the Franchising Code are to be complied with prior to the making of the agreement. As stated by Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 200 ALR 491 at [191], the provisions of the Franchising Code are to be read literally.

56 Each of the distributors in both the Swisscom aspect and Vending Machine aspect of these proceedings entered into a distributorship or purchasing agreement with either Global or In Touch.</text>

<text>48 There is surprisingly little authority upon the provision in question. There is discussion of it in the judgment of the Full Industrial Court in Wells v John R Lewis (International) Pty Ltd (1975) 25 FLR 194 at 204 206 and in that of Franki J in Swan v Downes (1978) 34 FLR 36 particularly at 40 46. (See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; (2001) 114 FCR 472 at [67] , [76] [79]; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen [2003] FCA 897 ; (2003) 132 FCR 309 at [32] .)

51 The other relevant extension to personal liability is effected by s 6(3) relating to conduct involving the use of postal, telegraphic or telephonic services. There are a number of examples of the operation of this extension commencing with Wells v John R Lewis (International) Pty Ltd at 203 204 and including Handley v Snoid (1981) ATPR 40-219 at 42,990; Dickson v Gallagher (1985) ATPR 40-550 at 46,459; Haydon v Jackson (1988) ATPR 40-845 at 49,097 per Fisher J (agreed in by Lockhart J). The decision of Von Doussa J in Snyman v Cooper (1989) 24 FCR 433 at 440 442 favours a wide interpretation of the provision. That point did not arise on the appeal ( Snyman v Cooper (No 2) (1990) 25 FCR 470). Some recent examples include Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes (2002) ATPR 41-863 at 44,792; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen at [32]; Quality Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd v Millford Builders (Vic) Pty Ltd [2003] QSC 95 at [37] [41]; and Guglielman v Trescowthick [2004] FCA 326 at [85] [88].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1365.html</AustLII>
<text>54 The ACCC further alleges that the corporate respondents entirely failed to comply with Div 2.1 and Div 2.2 of the Franchising Code which set out the statutory obligations of a franchisor (relevantly the corporate respondents as alleged) prior to entering into a franchising agreement (see cl 6 to 11 of the Franchising Code ). The relevant parts of the legislation are discussed by Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead (Franchising) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [4] [11]. The obligations, which the corporate respondents failed to satisfy, include maintaining a disclosure document in the form annexed to the Franchising Code and, prior to entering into franchising agreements with franchisees (relevantly the distributors involved in the proceedings):
 
 (a) providing such a disclosure document to the franchisees;
 (b) providing a copy of the Franchising Code to the franchisees; and 
 (c) receiving certain signed statements from the franchisees.</text>

<tocase>Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/75.html</AustLII>
<text>68 Proof of the losses has to be examined. I am satisfied as to the quantum claimed in each case as to the losses flowing from each relationship. There is a question as to parties. In some cases, the relevant agreement was entered into by a company associated with and funded by the individual(s) who were influenced by the misleading conduct. The calculation of damages thus raises the issues discussed in the authorities referred to in Harris v Milfull [2002] FCAFC 442 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 542, particularly Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215. There may be difficulties in sorting out losses suffered by the shareholders on the one hand and the company on the other. However, in the context of s 87(1B), there does not appear to be any barrier to claiming the overall losses jointly (and not severally) between the shareholder(s) and the company in such a case without dissection where each has consented to the proceeding as required. That is the case with the claims by Radcliffe and Tauto Investments Pty Limited; Bu and Tinson Far Eastern Group Pty Limited; Woldemichael and Red Sea International Pty Limited; Tony Savino and SAV Enterprises Pty Limited (all in relation to Vending Machines); Loncarie and Caslow Pty Limited; King and Flexprint Pty Limited; Vella and Global Mobile Solutions Pty Limited and Smith and Gelco Limited (all in relation to Swisscom).

70 There is an issue where the only claim is personal, but where the business was conducted in whole or in part by a company. That was the case in relation to each of Bartlett and Singh (re Vending Machines) and Bowen (re Swisscom). Bartlett entered into the agreement himself, and the company was collateral to that agreement. Singh initially signed the agreement himself, and the early expenses were paid personally but there was a later novation to Perfect Communications Pty Limited. A second agreement was signed by Singh in person. The Swisscom agreement was signed by the Bowens personally. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the companies involved in these cases included external shareholders or carried on any separate businesses that could not be segregated from the company or of the subject businesses. That being so, Gould v Vaggelas permits an analysis that can include loss to the individuals by reference to the effect upon them of the affairs of the company. On that basis the evidence is sufficient to establish the loss claimed, although not as detailed as it might be.

71 Interest should be included in the compensation orders pursuant to s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) at the rate of 10.5 per cent per year on the whole of each award for the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which the judgment is entered.

72 The ACCC is entitled to a general order for costs including reserved costs except as against Global and In Touch. There should be a special order as sought in relation to the costs of 10, 25 and 26 May 2005 that were reserved.</text>

<text>57 The inference that the evidence of the individual respondents would not have assisted their respective cases is available Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 312 and 321 . There is now a plethora of cases explaining the context of that inference in various ways. It may be accepted that it does not provide positive evidence to fill a gap in the ACCC's case. However, it may strengthen an inference otherwise available on the evidence or, to put it another way, may make a court more comfortable in drawing such an inference. Of course, the inference has particular application where positive evidence is not challenged. I should add that I do not propose to act upon any inference arising out of the answers to, or the failure to answer, interrogatories in relation to Nicholas Yates or Nicholas Rhodin.

58 I do not accept the argument that there is any special standard of proof beyond the balance of probabilities applicable to this proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Quinlivan v Australian Competition and Consumer Competition [2004] FCAFC 175 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/175.html</AustLII>
<text>45 Until the decision of the Full Court in Quinlivan v Australian Competition and Consumer Competition [2004] FCAFC 175 there were unsettled questions concerning the interrelationship between s 51A and s 75B of the Act. Despite submissions to the contrary by counsel for the ACCC, in my opinion that decision settled those questions for the purposes of a single judge, with one possible qualification. The reasoning of the Full Court appears as follows (at [10] [15]):
 
 'From the interaction of these provisions three conclusions emerge. First, s 51A does not detract from the Yorke principle that actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention is required if s 75B or s 80 is to apply. Where the contravening conduct involves misrepresentation, whether as to a future matter or not, this principle requires actual knowledge by the accessorial respondent of the falsity of the representation. This is an essential matter which must be alleged and proved: Su v Direct Flights International Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 78 at [38] , Fernandez v Glev Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1859 at [18] . 
 Secondly, the reversal of onus in s 51A(2) does not apply where the accessorial liability of s 75B or s 80 is relied on. 
 ... 
 Thirdly, it is implicit in s 51A(1) that where a corporation does have reasonable grounds for making a representation with respect to a future matter then there will be no contravention of s 52. 
 ... 
 Accordingly, where s 75B or s 80 accessorial liability is in issue in relation to a representation with respect to a future matter, the existence or otherwise of reasonable grounds will be relevant. If reasonable grounds exist, there will have been no contravention and thus no question of accessorial liability will arise. However, as against the accessorial respondent, the onus will be on the applicant to show the respondent had actual knowledge that 
 
 &#8226; the representation was made and 
 &#8226; it was misleading or 
 &#8226; the corporation had no reasonable grounds for making it 
 
 (See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1439 at [303] .)'

46 The qualification is that in a case such as the present, where the corporations are parties, there is an argument available that the liability of the corporation should be decided in accordance with s 51A for all purposes including assessment of accessorial liability.</text>

<text>51 The other relevant extension to personal liability is effected by s 6(3) relating to conduct involving the use of postal, telegraphic or telephonic services. There are a number of examples of the operation of this extension commencing with Wells v John R Lewis (International) Pty Ltd at 203 204 and including Handley v Snoid (1981) ATPR 40-219 at 42,990; Dickson v Gallagher (1985) ATPR 40-550 at 46,459; Haydon v Jackson (1988) ATPR 40-845 at 49,097 per Fisher J (agreed in by Lockhart J). The decision of Von Doussa J in Snyman v Cooper (1989) 24 FCR 433 at 440 442 favours a wide interpretation of the provision. That point did not arise on the appeal ( Snyman v Cooper (No 2) (1990) 25 FCR 470). Some recent examples include Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes (2002) ATPR 41-863 at 44,792; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen at [32]; Quality Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd v Millford Builders (Vic) Pty Ltd [2003] QSC 95 at [37] [41]; and Guglielman v Trescowthick [2004] FCA 326 at [85] [88].</text>

<text>59 The submissions for the ACCC in relation to each of Nicholas Yates and Nicholas Rhodin referred to the use that may be made of falsehoods referring to the well-known passage from the judgment of Gibbs J in Steinberg v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1973] HCA 11 ; (1975) 134 CLR 640 at 694 in view of their participation in the setting up of false referees to corroborate the representations made to prospective distributors. I accept that the conduct did take place, and would infer that the false references were for the purpose of buttressing the representations made. That would assist in drawing the inference that those involved knew that the representations had been made and were false.</text>
