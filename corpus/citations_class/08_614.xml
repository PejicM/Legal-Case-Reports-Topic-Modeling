<text>15 But this Court should not be left to speculate. Grounds of Appeal should be drafted in such a manner as to expose to both the respondents and to this Court the errors alleged to have been committed. An unrepresented party has no licence to not comply with O 52, r 13(2)(b) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). That rule provides that a notice of appeal shall state " briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the appeal " . In Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 , 55 IPR 354 Branson J observed of this provision :
 [4] A ground of appeal is a basis upon which the appellant will contend that the judgment, or a part of the judgment, should be set aside or varied by the Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Not every grievance entertained by a party, or its legal advisors, in respect of the factual findings or legal reasoning of the primary judge will constitute a ground of appeal. Findings as to subordinate or basic facts will rarely, if ever, found a ground of appeal. Even were the Full Court to be persuaded that different factual findings of this kind should have been made, this would not of itself lead to the judgment, or part of the judgment, being set aside or varied. This result would be achieved, if at all, only if the Full Court were persuaded that an ultimate fact in issue had been wrongly determined. The same applies with respect to steps in the primary judge's process of legal reasoning. Although alleged errors with respect to findings as to subordinate or basic facts, and as to steps in a process of legal reasoning leading to an ultimate conclusion of law, may be relied upon to support a ground of appeal, they do not themselves constitute a ground of appeal. [5] A useful practical guide is that a notice of appeal which cannot be used to provide a sensible framework for the appellant's submissions to the Full Court is almost certainly a notice of appeal which fails to comply with the requirements of O52 r13(2)(b). Neither the notice of appeal nor the document containing the revised grounds of appeal was, or could have been, so utilised in this case.

<text>28 Indeed, the Tribunal's reasons set forth a detailed account of the evidence before it and a detailed account as to its " Findings and reasons " based upon the evidence. Findings were made on " material questions of fact " and reference made to the evidence upon which those findings were based. The reasons of the Tribunal, it is considered, " inform " the Appellant (and others) as to why the application for review was unsuccessful. Those reasons are not to be scrutinised in any " over-zealous " manner seeking to discern some inadequacy by the way in which the reasons have been expressed: cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 , 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

29 The second Ground of Appeal is also rejected.

30 The third Ground of Appeal asserts a jurisdictional error by reason of the fact that the Tribunal " mentioned that, ' the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's business suffered losses as a result of a harm from Hindu' " and thereafter the fact that the Tribunal " mentioned that the Tribunal has accepted that the applicant's business has suffered losses in India and has been forced to close ".</text>

<text>19 This aspect of the first Ground of Appeal also does not prevail. Section 424A(3)(a) excludes from the operation of s 424A information " that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member ". This provision imposes one test and does not contain two disjunctive elements; that is to say, the provision is referring to information that is not specifically about an applicant or another person (such as a witness) but is " by way of contradistinction about a class of persons of which an applicant or the other person is a member ": Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 at [64] , [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572 at 586 per Beaumont J; see also Merkel and Hely JJ at [138].

20 A review of what is understood to be the " information " only exposes information that is " not specifically about " the Appellant.

21 The " information " set forth by the Tribunal contains an outline of the formation of the " People's War Group ", its aims and ideology and an extract of a United States Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2000 . Further " information " is also set forth by the Tribunal as to freedom of religion in India and a Report from the UK Home Office on communal violence. None of this " information " refers at all to the Appellant.</text>

<text>33 The findings of fact made by the Tribunal were findings open to it, especially bearing in mind the adverse findings which had been made as to credit. If a tribunal does not believe a particular witness, no detailed reasons need be given for those adverse findings: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 , 168 ALR 407. Justice McHugh there concluded: 
 [67] In addition, the prosecutor alleges that the Tribunal breached s430(1) by failing to set out reasons for its finding that the prosecutor's claim that members of PLOTE tried to recruit him were "utterly implausible". However, this was essentially a finding as to whether the prosecutor should be believed in his claim -- a finding on credibility which is the function of the primary decision maker par excellence. If the primary decision maker has stated that he or she does not believe a particular witness, no detailed reasons need to be given as to why that particular witness was not believed. The Tribunal must give the reasons for its decision, not the sub-set of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence. ...

34 The final Ground of Appeal is also rejected.

35 The Orders of the Court are : 
 
1. The appeal be dismissed. 
 
2. The Appellant to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal.

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26</tocase>
<text>9 Section 424A(1) requires the Tribunal to provide " clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review ". It is a provision which imposes a mandatory requirement and a breach of that section constitutes jurisdictional error: SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 at [77] per McHugh J, at [173] per Kirby J, at [208] per Hayne J, [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294 ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [13] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 614 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.

14 Even if the deficiencies in the Notice of Appeal be left to one side, a review of the terms of the 4 April 2007 letter and the terms of the decision of the reconstituted Tribunal does not reveal any relevant " information " which should have been brought to the Appellant's attention and which was not referred to in the letter. In particular, it should be noted that the term " information " in s 424A(1) does not extend to " the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence ": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ there held:
 [18] ... if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word "information": ... does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc ... If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself. 
This may have been what was envisaged by the Appellant. The grounds of the application as made to the Federal Magistrates Court similarly contended that there had been a failure to comply with s 424A and separately contended that the Tribunal had not informed " the applicant regarding the inconsistent evidence ". It may be that the Appellant sought to combine these contentions into the first Ground of Appeal . But that is speculation. Even if that was what was intended, there has been no failure to inform the Appellant of the inconsistencies relied upon and no failure to comply with s 424A.</text>

<text>4 A reconstituted Tribunal heard the application and again the decision not to grant a Protection (Class XA) Visa was affirmed. Again the Tribunal made adverse findings as to the applicant's credit. The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application to review this subsequent decision of the Tribunal: SZJJC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1986.

5 The proceeding presently before this Court is an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. The Grounds of Appeal seek to raise three contentions, namely:
 
(i) that there has been a breach of s 424A(1) and (3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth);
 
(ii) that there has been a breach of s 430 of the 1958 Act; and 
 
(iii) that the Tribunal made a " jurisdictional error when the Tribunal mentioned that, 'the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's business suffered losses as a result of a harm from Hindu.' Then the Tribunal mentioned that the Tribunal has accepted that the applicant's business has suffered losses in India and has been forced to close." 
 
None of these Grounds has been made out and the appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. No error has been demonstrated in respect to the reasons for decision of the learned Federal Magistrate.

6 The Appellant appeared before the Court this afternoon unrepresented, although he did have the assistance of an interpreter.</text>

<tocase>VHAJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 186</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/186.html</AustLII>
<text>22 This class of " information " is that which falls within s 424A(3)(a): VHAJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 186 , 131 FCR 80. Justice Kenny there referred to information about entry rights of non-nationals and considered that such information was " just about " a class of persons. Her Honour continued: 
 [50] In reaching this conclusion, it is helpful to consider other instances in which a similar question has arisen. One example is country information. It is usual for the Tribunal to have regard to information about the social, political, religious and other conditions prevailing in a country relevant to an applicant's claim for refugee status, with a view to assessing whether other individuals who share his or her racial, religious, political, social or other attributes suffer treatment of a kind amounting to persecution on Convention grounds in that country. Sometimes information of this kind concerns religious practice, government elections, educational opportunities or other matters. This kind of country information is relevant to the Tribunal's decision-making task only because the applicant falls within the class of persons who share an attribute, which, according to his or her claim, gives rise to a well-founded fear of persecution in the country concerned. In this circumstance, the information does not cease to be information "just about" a class of persons simply because it can also be characterised as information about religious practice, government elections or educational opportunities. It has been repeatedly held that information of this kind falls within para424A(3)(a) of the [Migration] Act ... 

 
Justice Downes agreed. His Honour considered that " Official and semi-official information contained in documents assessing conditions in countries from which persons seeking refugee status regularly come ... has been held to fall within para 424A(3)(a) ": at [71].

23 In any event, it should be noted that the Tribunal disbelieved the evidence of the now Appellant as to his association with the " People's War Group ". The Tribunal's relevant finding was as follows:
 Having considered this evidence, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is, or has been, a member of the PWG. Nor does the Tribunal accept that the applicant has been a member of the All India Revolutionary Students Federation (AIRSF) or a member of the Communist Party of India. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has been targeted or in any way harmed by police or Hindus generally because of his involvement or association with the PWG or that he has been targeted by the PWG because he has attempted to resign from the PWG and/or because he has attempted to join other political parties. The Tribunal also does not accept that the applicant lost a child as a result of his membership or association with the PWG, that his house was bombed or that his wife was harmed as a result of his membership/association with the PWG.

24 The first Ground of Appeal is thus rejected.</text>
