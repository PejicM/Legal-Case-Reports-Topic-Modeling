<text>The Statutory Demand Proceeding and the Summary Dismissal Motion were listed for hearing on 1 June 2009 on which date I ordered that the Statutory Demand Proceeding be dismissed and that BCPL pay Mr Carroll's costs of that Proceeding: see Benson Communications Pty Limited v Carroll [2009] FCA 632.

The hearing therefore continued on the basis that it was only the Summary Dismissal Motion that was to be dealt with. The claims made in the ASC

Against this background, the material facts as alleged in the ASC can be summarised. I will use abbreviated forms of reference in the ASC. Numerals in bold in square brackets are references to paragraphs so numbered in the ASC.</text>

<tocase>Benson v Carroll [2008] FCA 1729</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1729.html</AustLII>
<text>On 6 November 2008, I dealt with the motion brought by the applicants in this proceeding to set aside the order of dismissal of 23 April 2008, and ordered that the order of dismissal be set aside: see Benson v Carroll [2008] FCA 1729.

On 26 May 2009, Mr Carroll as respondent in the Statutory Demand Proceeding filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the Statutory Demand Proceeding be heard concurrently with the present Summary Dismissal Motion.</text>

<tocase>Gordon v Gibbons (1873) 12 SCR (NSW)(L) 40</tocase>
<text>The applicants rely on Gordon v Gibbons (1873) 12 SCR (NSW)(L) 40. That case concerned an unincorporated mining company formed under a deed of settlement. In accordance with the terms of the deed, the directors sued a member for calls. It was held (by majority) that the action did not lie because any recovery would be partnership property and the defendant was a member of the partnership. The Court distinguished a claim for damages or money which, when recovered, would be the plaintiff's own property.

This case lends support to the applicants. The damages that they seek to recover would not be partnership property but would be their own property (in the case of BCPL, as trustee for the Grantham Project (Trust), but that is beside the point).

For the above reasons, the respondents' motion for summary dismissal should be dismissed with costs. The proceeding will be listed for the making of directions.
 I certify that the preceding one hundred and twelve (112) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.

<tocase>Henderson v Henderson [1843] EngR 917 ; (1843) 3 Hare 100 (67 ER 313)</tocase>
<text>In summary, the respondents submit, first, that the claims or some of the claims made in this proceeding could only have been made in the Supreme Court Proceeding, and, second, that the subject matter of this proceeding properly belonged to the Supreme Court Proceeding so that the applicants are precluded from pursuing this proceeding by reason of the principle commonly associated with Henderson v Henderson [1843] EngR 917 ; (1843) 3 Hare 100 (67 ER 313) and Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ( Anshun ).

In Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1996) the learned authors state (at [452]): 
 
 There is no doubt that the Henderson principle and the Kilbrandon test (a reference to Lord Kilbrandon's remarks in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Yat Tung Investment Co. Ltd. v Dao Heng Bank Ltd. [1975] AC 581) apply with full rigour to proceedings for an account. A simple account may be taken at the trial, and where this occurs, the nature of the proceedings may be obscured. A judicial account involves the offsetting of credit items on both sides to reach a balance in favour of one party. The result can only be final if all relevant claims and cross-claims are either brought forward for adjudication or treated as abandoned. 
 

 
Again, this passage leaves open the question what are "all relevant claims and cross-claims". Clearly, it would not be open to a partner to advance a later claim to recover property that had been treated as partnership property in the taking of accounts or to contend in a later proceeding that the partners' "loan accounts" in the partnership books, on the basis of which the partnership accounts had been taken, were otherwise than what they had been treated as being in the taking of those accounts. The claims for unliquidated damages made by the applicants outside the scope of the partnership are of a different kind.</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>In summary, the respondents submit, first, that the claims or some of the claims made in this proceeding could only have been made in the Supreme Court Proceeding, and, second, that the subject matter of this proceeding properly belonged to the Supreme Court Proceeding so that the applicants are precluded from pursuing this proceeding by reason of the principle commonly associated with Henderson v Henderson [1843] EngR 917 ; (1843) 3 Hare 100 (67 ER 313) and Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ( Anshun ).

As noted earlier, the respondents submit that some of the claims made by the applicants in this proceeding could only have been asserted in a taking of partnership accounts. The respondents have not, however, adequately identified the claims said to be of that kind. The respondents accept that there are other claims made by the applicants in this proceeding that could not have been addressed as part of a taking of partnership accounts, and submit that those claims should have been advanced by cross-claim in the Supreme Court Proceeding in accordance with what I shall describe as "the Anshun principle". The respondents submit that the claims of the second kind are so intertwined with those of the first kind that both kinds should have been dealt with in the Supreme Court Proceeding.

In my opinion, the respondents' submissions gloss over many difficulties.

In the first place, as noted earlier, there were two partnerships. There was the partnership between BCPL as trustee and HCPPL as trustee constituted by the MoU dated 25 November 2004 (the Earlier Partnership) and in the second place, at least according to Mr Carroll and apparently accepted in the Supreme Court Proceeding by BCPL, there was a partnership between Mr Carroll and BCPL from 30 September 2005 down to the time of the termination or dissolution of that partnership, whenever that was (the Later Partnership).

I turn now to Anshun .

According to Anshun , the question to be asked in Australia in relation to the respondents' second ground of attack is not whether the claims advanced in the later proceeding "could" more conveniently have been advanced in the earlier proceeding. The test is not whether it would have been more efficient and less wasteful, in terms of judicial and other resources, if the issues in the later proceeding had been made the subject of the earlier proceeding.

Anshun itself was a case of inconsistency between the determination of the earlier proceeding and the making of a claim in the later proceeding a circumstance that does not attend the present case. In Anshun , a workman was injured in the course of his employment when a load of girders handled by a crane being used by Anshun Pty Ltd (Anshun) and hired from the Port of Melbourne Authority (Authority) struck him. Under the crane hiring agreement, the Authority enjoyed an indemnity by Anshun in relation to any injury arising directly or indirectly out of the use of the crane during the hiring period. The workman sued the Authority and Anshun. They claimed contribution from each other. The Authority's contribution notice, however, did not claim the indemnity. In the earlier proceeding, judgment was entered in the action against both defendants with costs, and it was ordered that Anshun should recover from the Authority contribution to the extent of 90% and the Authority from Anshun to the extent of 10% of those damages and costs.

In the later proceeding, the Authority sued Anshun under the indemnity agreement to recover the amounts that the Authority had paid as damages and interest and for legal costs and disbursements. The primary Judge ordered that the Authority's proceeding be perpetually stayed on the ground that the Authority should have pleaded the indemnity in the earlier litigation.

It will be seen that the determination of the cross-claims in the earlier proceeding decided the question of the extent of the liabilities inter se of Anshun and the Authority. It would be inconsistent with that determination for the Authority to be held entitled to recover 100% in the later proceeding. As Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ noted, in the later proceeding the Authority asserted a right inconsistent with the right asserted in the earlier proceeding.

The circumstances and issues in Anshun are far removed from those of the present case.

In Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 , Brennan and Dawson JJ stated (at 345) that it may be that Anshun is a case of mere issue estoppel. Pertinently for the present case, their Honours said (at 346): 
 
 A plaintiff who has an unadjudicated cause of action which can be enforced only in fresh proceedings ( Duedu v Yiboe [[1961] 1 W.L.R. 1040, at p.1046] cannot be precluded from taking fresh proceedings merely because he could have and, if you will, should have counterclaimed on that cause of action in a forum chosen by the opposite party in proceedings in which the opposite party sued him. We do not read the majority judgment in Port of Melbourne Authority v. Anshun Pty. Ltd. as holding the contrary, except in a case where the relief claimed in the second proceeding is inconsistent with the judgment in the first: see especially at pp. 599-601. That is not the present case. [My emphasis] 
 

 
The passage emphasised is applicable to the circumstances of the present case.

Like Anshun , the case raised an issue of inconsistency. Whether the farm was or was not partnership property lay at the heart of the Master's inquiry and must be taken to have been determined by the Master's certificate.</text>

<tocase>Public Trustee v Kenward [1967] 1 WLR 1062</tocase>
<text>Public Trustee v Kenward [1967] 1 WLR 1062 was also a case of the taking of partnership accounts. The plaintiff was judicial trustee of a deceased's estate. He sued the defendant for the balance found due by the defendant to the estate on an account and inquiry taken in earlier administration proceedings to which the defendant was a party. The defendant had not challenged the Master's certificate in that proceeding. The enquiry before the Master had related to a farming business carried on by the defendant in partnership with the deceased, in whom the farm was vested, and no evidence was adduced before the Master to suggest that the land was not the sole property of the deceased.

On the plaintiff's application for summary judgment, the defendant sought leave to defend on the ground that he had a valid counterclaim for a share in the proceeds of sale of the farm land and the income thereof since the deceased's death and for the cost of certain improvements, on the basis that the land was an asset of the partnership. He offered an explanation of his failure to raise this point before the Master on the taking of partnership accounts.

Buckley J held that the defendant was estopped by the Master's certificate from setting up the claim that the land was a partnership asset, since an allegation that it was would have been germane to the accounts and enquiry before the Master, which was directed to determining finally what sum the defendant should pay to the estate. At 1067C, His Lordship stated: 
 
 I think the question in the present case must be whether it is right to regard the claim which the defendant now wants to raise as something which properly belonged to the subject-matter of the account and inquiry directed by the order of March 21, 1962. If it were a matter which can be said properly to have belonged to that investigation of the relative rights of the defendant and testatrix's estate, then the fact that the defendant, whether it be by inadvertence or accident or as the result of his being unwisely advised or lacking advice, did not raise the point on any of those grounds would be no justification for allowing him to raise it now.</text>

<tocase>Sheaffe v Hungerford (1879) 1 QLJ (Supp) 51</tocase>
<text>The present case has some similarity to Sheaffe v Hungerford (1879) 1 QLJ (Supp) 51. In that case the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to enter into a partnership to form and carry on the business of a cattle station. The plaintiff was to provide the grazing country; the defendant 5200 head of cattle by instalments. After supplying some of the cattle, the defendant refused to supply any more.

The plaintiff sought: 
(1) that the parties' rights and interests under the partnership agreement might be defined;
 
(2) damages for breach of the agreement consisting of the defendant's failure to send the cattle;
 
(3) a dissolution of the partnership if any had been created.

Lilley CJ said (at 53) in relation to the claim for damages: 
 
 The action is substantially for damages, and under the old system the defendant would be entitled to a verdict. But the plaintiff has asked that the suit may be treated as one for the administration of the partnership affairs, and for a dissolution. There are in my opinion sufficient grounds to grant this application, but I need not state them as the defendant does not oppose a decree on this point." 
 

 
In view of the consent and the absence of reasons on the point, the case is weak or no authority for the proposition that a claim for damages by one partner against another can, let alone should, be dealt with in a suit for the taking of partnership accounts. In any event, the claim for damages was one between the partners alone and was for breach or repudiation of the partnership agreement itself. The complexities to which I have already referred show that the circumstances of the present case are far removed from those in Sheaffe v Hungerford .</text>
