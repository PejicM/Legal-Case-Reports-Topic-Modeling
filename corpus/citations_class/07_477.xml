<text>22 The Williams &amp; Hughes/Hillcrest retainer appears to have been for limited legal services ("[a]dvising and negotiating on behalf of Chris Gurtler in communications with Kosta Patsan and Finance Now Pty Ltd's solicitors"). It described Hillcrest as the "client" for the purposes of the agreement. It envisaged that Hillcrest would give instructions (cl 22). I would simply note in passing that this agreement did not provide Hillcrest with a level of control of the litigation comparable to that had by the litigation funder in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 ALR 58; for aspects of the terms of which see Fostif Pty Ltd v Campbells Cash &amp; Carry Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 83 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 203 at [78] - [82] .</text>

<tocase>Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360</tocase>
<text>31 I would simply note in passing that this affidavit does not suggest, expressly or impliedly, that the decision to join Mr Turnbull was the subject of, or was contributed to by, legal advice from Williams &amp; Hughes let alone did it "put in issue ... advice received": Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 at 372. However, it does indicate that instructions were given to join Mr Turnbull. And as the joinder motion filed on 31 August 2006 by Williams &amp; Hughes illustrates, those instructions were acted on.

32 The challenge to the privilege claim is put on four discrete bases. They are that:
 
 (i) by putting in issue his state of mind in applying to join Mr Turnbull, Mr Gurtler has waived privilege in respect of that matter ("issue waiver"); 
 (ii) by disclosing he instructed his solicitors, Williams &amp; Hughes, to apply to join Mr Turnbull, he has waived privilege in those instructions ("disclosure waiver")'
 (iii) there is a prima facie case that the substantial purposes of the legal advice was for Hillcrest's own purposes, and hence was not subject to any privilege claimed by Mr Gurtler ("Hillcrest pursuing its own purposes"); and
 (iv) there is a prima facie case that the communications with Williams &amp; Hughes concerning the joinder were in pursuance of a deliberately improper purpose and as such were not protected by legal professional privilege ("the fraud/improper purpose exception").

35 What is notable of issue waiver cases, as the Full Court indicated in Rio Tinto (at [47]), is their fact specific character. Nonetheless, observations in that case on the joint judgment of Kiefel and Finn JJ in Spalvins are appropriate to the present matter. In Spalvins Kiefel J and I said (at 371-372):
 
 "The usual type of case said to illustrate issue waiver at common law is one in which, in order to establish a particular right, claim, or defence a party who previously has been legally advised, or has provided advice, needs to show that the advice so given did, or did not, have a particular character, for example that it was or was not negligent where the claim is for professional negligence against the adviser: see Kershaw v Whelan [1996] 1 WLR 358; that it was not based on full information or was not meaningful, in an undue influence claim: see Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar [1929] AC 127 at 130-131; see also Bester v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [1970] 3 NSWR 30 and Brusewitz v Brown [1923] NZLR 1106 or that it did not address or properly address a matter which, if addressed or properly addressed, would defeat or call into question the right or claim asserted as in claims where the applicant has to demonstrate he or she acted with or without adequate knowledge of a matter: see Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council (1939) 39 SR (NSW) 347; Hongkong Bank of Australia Ltd v Murphy [1993] 2 VR 419; Pickering v Edmunds (1994) 63 SASR 357. In other words the cases are ones in which, in the substantive proceeding brought, the privilege holder has put in issue the very advice received. We observe in passing that it is questionable whether advice can properly be said to be in issue in a proceeding merely because it may be relevant to an issue in it: see Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc v The Home Indemnity Company (3 rd Cir 1994) 32 F (3d) 851 at 863; save, perhaps, where the proceeding is between client and legal adviser and the advice is relevant to the adviser's defence of that proceeding: see Lillicrap v Nalder &amp; Son [1993] 1 WLR 94; 1 All ER 724.

36 The Full Court in Rio Tinto said of this (at [53]-[54]):
 
 "... this correctly summarises the effect of previous authorities, such as Thomason, United States Surgical and Benecke . Referring to the observation of Kirby J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 137 ALR 28 at 34; [1996] HCA 15 ; 70 ALJR 603 at 607; [1996] HCA 15 that a mere reference to legal advice will not amount to disclosure, the Spalvins court found that, for the most part, the ASC had done no more than this and had not, therefore, waived privilege. 
 
 Although the Full Court was necessarily guided by the authorities prior to Mann , there is little, if anything, in the passage quoted above that would require modification to take account of Mann . It is plain enough that the majority in Mann also saw the 'issue waiver' cases as a species of waiver, to which the same basic principle applied. Their Honours' analysis in Spalvins emphasises, as does the majority in Mann , that waiver comes about because the privilege holder's conduct is inconsistent with the continued confidentiality of the communication because he or she has put in issue the character or contents of the communication in pursuing a right or claim , or has created a situation where another party must reasonably do so by way of a defence."

34 Given that the privilege issue arises here on a pre-trial motion it is governed by the common law of legal professional privilege, not by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Issue waiver, a form of implied waiver of privilege, is governed by the principle of "inconsistency" stated in the majority judgment of the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [29]:
 
 "Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is 'imputed by operation of law'. This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege ... What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large."

36 The Full Court in Rio Tinto said of this (at [53]-[54]):
 
 "... this correctly summarises the effect of previous authorities, such as Thomason, United States Surgical and Benecke . Referring to the observation of Kirby J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 137 ALR 28 at 34; [1996] HCA 15 ; 70 ALJR 603 at 607; [1996] HCA 15 that a mere reference to legal advice will not amount to disclosure, the Spalvins court found that, for the most part, the ASC had done no more than this and had not, therefore, waived privilege.

 (Emphasis added)

38 I would add the following which is of some present importance given the first respondent's oral submissions. As the High Court emphasised in Mann v Carnell , it is inconsistency, not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large that governs implied waiver.

39 I reject the first respondent's contention.

40 This contention can be disposed of shortly. Mr Gurtler has disclosed the fact of a particular instruction having been given - a fact, moreover, which would reasonably be inferred if no such disclosure had been made from the later filing of a motion to join Mr Turnbull. No disclosure was made of the actual content of the communication made or of any advice given in consequence of it. If a disclosure of this variety could result in the loss of privilege by the calling into question of why the particular procedural step it involved had been taken, the basis of the privilege itself would in my view be seriously weakened.

41 All that the affidavit did is to indicate the nature of the instruction given. It did not reveal the basis of, the terms of, or a "version of": cf Mann v Carnell at [28] the communication. Mr Gurtler has not acted in a way which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege protects.

42 Finance Now's contention is that there is a prima facie basis for alleging that the substantial purpose of advice provided by Williams &amp; Hughes in respect of which privilege is claimed, was advice to Hillcrest for the purpose of Hillcrest conducting the litigation for its own benefit.

43 The prima facie basis relied upon to demonstrate that the advice was to Hillcrest are:
 
 (a) the litigation funding agreement and, in particular, the two retainers both of which showed Hillcrest as a client and able to give instructions; and 
 (b) the list of privileged documents shows that, subject to limited exception, Williams &amp; Hughes received correspondence regarding the 31 July 2006 email and the proposed joinder of Mr Turnbull, from Hillcrest rather than Mr Gurtler himself.</text>

<tocase>Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Anderson &amp; Co (1997) 70 SASR 166</tocase>
<text>37 I set out earlier Mr Gurtler's affidavit evidence concerning his proposed joinder of Mr Turnbull. While his evidence related to the fact that he gave instructions to Williams &amp; Hughes to apply to have Mr Turnbull joined and that instruction was acted upon he did not either expressly or impliedly refer to, let alone put in issue, the character or contents of any communications made to, or by, Williams and Hughes. While Finance Now has put in issue the reasons why Mr Gurtler proposed to join Mr Turnbull and Mr Gurtler has sought to answer that, he has not done so in a fashion which could reasonably relate his reasons for the decision, explicitly or implicitly, to communications made in the lawyer-client relationship. Thus he has not engaged in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of lawyer-client communications. Whatever was the substance of the communications made by Williams &amp; Hughes to Mr Gurtler and Mr Van Noort which related to the decision to join Mr Turnbull and which are listed in Mr Gurtler's affidavit, there is on the material before me no reasonable grounds for believing that legal advice contributed to that decision: cf Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Arthur Anderson &amp; Co (1997) 70 SASR 166 at 175-176.

58 It has been put on behalf of Mr Gurtler that while the email should neither have been couched in the terms it was nor have been sent at all, all it involved was a sharp practice and demonstrated a lack of commercial probity: cf Southern Equities Corporation at 174. The email itself indicated that the accounts had been analysed and the conclusion arrived at from that analysis (i.e. the accounts were "cracked"). It also indicated that the stated conclusion were, in Mr Van Noort's view, supported by the bank statements. This, it is said, is not an allegation of fraud knowingly raised without any basis. A sufficient basis had been given at that stage the matter was not as yet the subject of a pleading and that was enough to dispel the allegation of deliberately improper purpose.

59 My own view is that the email was a disreputable and inflammatory vehicle through which to make imputations against Mr Hambrett and, by implication, Mr Turnbull. This said, the email does not have the particular character ascribed to it by Finance Now. It cannot be said that it lacks any disclosed and proper basis for its core allegation "the accounts are a complete and total fabrication". On this I agree with the submissions made by Mr Gurtler. Yet it is upon the supposed lack of such a basis that the challenge to the claim of legal professional privilege has been made. Reliance, as Finance Now places, on the apparent regularity of the accounts on their face as a foundation for asserting there were prima facie grounds for saying there was no proper basis for the allegations of fraud, simply ignores the basis of the allegation being made. I equally agree that, at the time the allegation was made, i.e. prior to the pleading of the alleged fraud, the basis given for the allegation was sufficient to dispel the assertion that it lacked foundation. Whether it proves to be correct or not is not of present concern.

60 I cannot in the circumstances see why Mr Gurtler's alleged failure to withdraw the allegation is in any way of assistance to Finance Now. Nor do I consider he can relevantly be faulted for present purposes for not disavowing the sharp and unauthorised practice of his agent. There is no material before me suggesting Mr Gurtler knew of, and condoned that practice. While, as a matter of reasonable commercial standards, one may have expected some reassurance from Mr Gurtler of appropriate behaviour in "the Federal court action" an action in any event subject to judicial management and scrutiny the lack of this is not, in the circumstances, suggestive of the improper purpose alleged.</text>

<tocase>Farrow Mortgage Services Pty Ltd (in liq) v Webb (1996) 39 NSWLR 601</tocase>
<text>48 Before dealing directly with the first respondent's contention there is one matter to which I need refer concerning the characterisation of Gurtler-Hillcrest relationship for the purposes of legal professional privilege. It relates to common interest privilege. Having regard to their relationship inter se in light of the funding agreement and the common retainer, and of their common interest in the successful prosecution of the litigation and in advice given in relation thereto, I am satisfied that a possibly distinctive form of common interest privilege exists between them in relation to lawyer-client communications in the Gurtler proceedings: on common interest privilege see generally Farrow Mortgage Services Pty Ltd (in liq) v Webb (1996) 39 NSWLR 601 at 609 ff; Patrick v Capital Finance Corporation (Australasia) Pty Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 272 at [17]-[19]; Cross on Evidence, 25-265 (Aust ed). I do not, for present purposes, consider it appropriate to characterise their individual interests as selfish and potentially adverse to each other: cf Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 409-410. Rather, while each stands to gain differentially from the litigation, their interests are nonetheless common in that their individual interest came together in the successful prosecution of it.

49 I have described the common interest as possibly distinctive for this reason. It is well accepted that while, normally, all holders with a privilege based on common interest must concur in waiving it, fairness can require that disclosure by one holder of common interest privilege can have effect as a waiver by all: Farrow Mortgage Services Pty Ltd (in liq) , at 608; Patrick , at [23]-[29]. In the case of funded litigation, where the party who waives the litigation is the applicant or respondent in the proceedings, that waiver may well as of course bind the litigation funder, whether or not it has consented to the waiver. It is unnecessary that I express a concluded view on this.</text>

However and despite the "no oral modification" clause in the agreement, it was open to Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest to vary this if they so wished: see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at [213] - [227] . I would note, though, that the funding agreement probably did not preclude Mr Gurtler's use of the agency of Hillcrest in giving instructions in any event.

51 What is clear on the material before me is that, whether or not Hillcrest has acted in strict accordance with the written terms of the funding agreement, the manner of his communication with Williams &amp; Hughes was acquiesced in by Mr Gurtler. This is made clear in his affidavit verifying the list of documents produced. He designedly, as a matter of convenience, had Mr Van Noort deal directly with the lawyers to confirm his instructions or to comment upon their advice in order to enable the lawyers to further advance his case. It is unsurprising that he adopted this course given that as between them Mr Van Noort, as a lawyer, was likely to be more able to make forensic choices than Mr Gurtler: cf Fostif NSWCA at [137].

52 The 31 July email was one Mr Van Noort should never have sent. Nonetheless, on its face, and for the purposes of the Finance Now's present contention, it purports to have been in furtherance of the common interests of Mr Gurtler and Hillcrest. Mr Gurtler may have been unaware of its contents. Still he authorised Mr Van Noort's contact with Mr Hambrett. Whatever complaint Mr Gurtler may have had of his agent's conduct a matter between himself and his agent to which Finance Now was a stranger the email itself provides no basis for suggesting that Van Noort was acting other than in Gurtler's, hence their common, interest in the matter.</text>

<text>57 It is well recognised that a claim of legal professional privilege will not be upheld if the party resisting the claim for legal professional privilege can show reasonable grounds for believing that the communication effected by the document for which privilege is claimed was made for an illegal or improper purpose: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501; Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500; and see generally AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [211] - [219] . This does not require a demonstration that the legal advisers were themselves conscious participants in fulfilling the improper purpose: Yunghanns v Elfic Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 113 ; (2000) 1 VR 92 at 106. While it is not sufficient merely to allege improper purpose, it is not necessary fully to prove the allegations. There has to be something to give colour to the charge a prima facie case: Propend at 514.</text>
