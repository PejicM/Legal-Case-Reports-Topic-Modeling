<tocase>District Council of Coober Pedy v Collector of Customs [1993] FCA 187 ; (1993) 42 FCR 127</tocase>

<text>32 It cannot, in my opinion, be the position that, where an applicant has multiple purposes for engaging in conduct in Australia, no matter how relatively unimportant the s 91R(3) purpose may be, its existence will prevent the decision-maker from having regard to it. In a different context, this result might be avoided by a familiar technique of statutory construction: construing "the purpose" to mean "the real and substantial purpose": see eg. District Council of Coober Pedy v Collector of Customs [1993] FCA 187 ; (1993) 42 FCR 127. However such a simple solution would still leave problems.

33 An example prompted by current events may make this clear. Suppose that a Tibetan claiming refugee status here is asked by a friend to participate in a public protest against China's alleged maltreatment of Tibetan dissidents who include friends of his. Suppose his main purpose is to express his genuine outrage and to try to send a message to the Chinese government; suppose that he has another purpose, namely to have his protest photographed and sent back to dissident elements in Tibet in order to encourage them; suppose further that he also intends to use photographs thus taken to support his application for a protection visa but that he already possesses abundant, incontrovertible evidence of participating in similar protests outside Australia, so that, as he perceives matters, the intended photographs will be, as it were, merely the icing on the cake. Nevertheless, assume that supporting his refugee claim is a real and substantial purpose of his, albeit a relatively quite minor one. Suppose finally that before he can deliver his other, incontrovertible evidence to the Tribunal he loses it and cannot replicate it. It would, in my view, clearly be unfair by ordinary standards to prevent him from using the sur place evidence, and absent the clearest statutory language such an unfair result should not be imputed to be Parliament's intention.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Mohammed [2000] FCA 576 ; (2000) 98 FCR 405</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/576.html</AustLII>
<text>34 True it is that the example may be extreme and that hard cases can make bad law. True it is also that s 417 provides, at least in theory, a means for dealing with such hard cases (though its practical application seems in recent years to have been uncertain, and a parliamentary preference for the fiat of the Minister over a process that includes recourse to an independent tribunal should not readily be inferred). Nevertheless, the background to the enactment of s 91R(3) was the practice that arose of refugee status applicants participating in demonstrations of protest against the governments of their countries of nationality with the sole or at least dominant purpose of manufacturing evidence for their applications. Decisions of this Court may unintentionally have encouraged this practice, see eg Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Mohammed [2000] FCA 576 ; (2000) 98 FCR 405. Such at least was the Minister's view in his Second Reading speech. He said:
 
 I am also concerned about court decisions that have recognised the claims of applicants who have deliberately set out to contrive claims for refugee status after they have arrived in Australia.
 
 Such action, deliberately seeking to attract hostile attention from a home country government, makes a mockery of an applicant having a real fear of persecution.
 
 The legislation will make it clear that any actions by a person taken after arrival in Australia will be disregarded unless the minister is satisfied that the actions were not done just to strengthen claims for protection.
 
 The convention was not intended to provide protection to applicants who contrive claims in second or third countries and who have no other basis for claims to refugee status.
 
 However, in exceptional cases where a person has acted purely to strengthen their claims, and so as a result needs some protection, my ministerial intervention powers will allow me to intervene if it is in the public interest.
 (Emphasis added.)

35 In my opinion the problem referred to can be adequately overcome, and the real mischief that concerned the legislation's framers met, by interpreting "the purpose" as meaning "the dominant purpose". The Second Reading speech gives a sharper account of the mischief the subsection was aimed at than the Explanatory Memorandum and it supports the approach I favour. The context generally speaks against giving the statute an over-literal interpretation. There is some textual, as well as contextual, support in the statute for such an approach. The statutory test is whether the person concerned "engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening" his or her claim to refugee status. The use of the word "the" rather than "a" suggests that there will be a single purpose that can be regarded as "the" purpose. In a real world where behaviour commonly has multiple motivations and purposes, to fulfil the statutory notion it would be sufficient to read "purpose" in the way I propose (but also in no lesser way). That is obviously not to say, as the appellant would have it, that wherever there are multiple purposes, no matter how strong the purpose of simply aiding one's case, s 91R(3) will not apply. I therefore think that the draconian construction favoured in the court below was erroneous.

36 That error, however, does not in my opinion avail the appellant. In the first place, while his Honour may have erred, it is by no means clear to me that the Tribunal did so.

37 
 
Secondly, as the respondent points out, the Tribunal affirmatively found that it was "not satisfied that the applicant engaged in [the relevant] conduct ... otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his refugee claims" (emphasis added). That is, s 91R(3) , construed as I conceive that it should be, would still require that conduct to be disregarded. In the necessary exercise of discretion as to whether a constitutional writ should go, I would for that reason decline the relief sought.

38 Again, on a correct understanding of the Tribunal Member's reasons and findings, if there were any error by the Tribunal in understanding s 91R(3) it was, in my opinion, quite immaterial here.</text>

<text>39 The Tribunal member was clearly alive to the distinction between religious activity (or conduct) and the belief which allegedly motivated it. The Tribunal spoke, for example, of whether, "leaving aside his conduct", the appellant had "a genuine and sustained interest" in higher order religious practice. (That is so despite what may be the Tribunal's slightly confusing or ambiguous use of the term "role" as distinguished from conduct I think the Tribunal was using "role" to indicate the perception of him that others would have.) The distinction between motivation or belief on the one hand and "conduct" on the other has been noticed in this Court: see Wang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1599 ; (2000) 105 FCR 548 at [16] per Gray J and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [91] - [96] per Young J.</text>

<tocase>SZHAY v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 261</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/261.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The appellant submits that the Tribunal erred in so doing. Once the Tribunal held that the conduct in question was to be disregarded due to s 91R(3) , it had to disregard that conduct for all aspects of its decision. The appellant relies on two authorities to support his construction of s 91R(3) , both decisions of Driver FM: SZHAY v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 261 and SZJSD v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 604.

40 I agree with the respondent's analysis that the Tribunal rejected the appellant's sur place motivations and beliefs, but did not have relevant regard to his conduct, as an indicator of a likely "higher profile" if returned to China than he previously had there (on the Tribunal's findings). I accept, as the respondent seems to have done sub silentio , that Driver FM's point in SZHAY [2006] FMCA 261 and SZJSD [2007] FMCA 604 is correct: the word "disregard" in the subsection admits of no ambiguity. For the reasons given, however, there was no breach by the Tribunal of that statutory injunction. If, contrary to my view and that of the other judges I have referred to, sur place "conduct" in s 91R(3) should be regarded as including ideas and beliefs motivating the conduct, the only infraction of the subsection by the Tribunal was in looking at such ideation with a view to considering whether it might assist the appellant in relation to his likely future conduct if returned to China, and coming to a negative conclusion. It is very plain that, had no such regard been had to that ideation, the appellant's application was in any case doomed to failure. Again therefore, any error was immaterial, did not taint the decision and would not result in the issue of writs.</text>
