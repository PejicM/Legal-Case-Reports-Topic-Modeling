<tocase>Re Evandale Estates Ltd (Supreme Court of Victoria, June 1962, unreported)</tocase>
<text>12 In Re Evandale Estates Ltd (Supreme Court of Victoria, June 1962, unreported), Adam J directed an amendment as follows:
 The adoption and coming into operation of this Scheme of Arrangement shall for the purpose of any Statute of Limitations be an acknowledgement.

16 I do not purport to define or circumscribe the circumstances in which the Court may properly exercise the discretion to approve subject to alterations. The circumstances in which the Court may be asked to exercise the power vary. For example, the purpose may be to overcome minor technical errors or oversights present in the scheme as agreed to by the shareholders (see, for example, Re H Craig Pty Ltd ); to bring the scheme as agreed to by them into line with the explanatory statement that was sent to them (see, for example, Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd ); or to protect creditors (see, for example, Re Evandale Estates Ltd ). The alterations may be suggested by the plaintiff or by the Court. Apparently, however, the plaintiff would be entitled, if faced with alterations on which the Court insisted but to which it did not agree, to withdraw its application for approval.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2002/1177.html</AustLII>
<text>14 In Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601 , Barrett J approved a scheme subject to alterations which his Honour described as "peripheral" (at [21]). His Honour stated that the scheme in respect of which approval was sought differed in certain respects from the form of scheme that had been sent to members in accordance with the orders of the court previously made. Barrett J added (at [21]):
 It is clear, however, that the changes or differences are of a minor and technical kind and that their effect is to improve the smooth working of the scheme.
