<tocase>ACCC v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd (2003) ATPR 41-908</tocase>
<text>4 The test whether an undertaking given under s 87B has been breached is objective in the sense that intent of the party who breaches the undertaking is not relevant: see ACCC v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd (2003) 25 ATPR 41-908 at [41].

5 The ACCC submits that StoresOnline has breached certain terms of the undertaking it gave to the ACCC on 24 April 2006. The present application is said by the ACCC to be urgent because StoresOnline is likely to continue to breach the undertaking when its representatives arrive in Australia next Monday 22 October 2007 to give further presentations relating to the products it offers for sale. It argues that the power of the Court to grant interlocutory relief is grounded in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("FCA Act"), which gives the Court " power, in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction, to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders ... as the Court thinks appropriate ". It says that the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the matter is not limited by the TPA. Finally, it submits that the balance of convenience falls in favour of the Court exercising its power to grant the relief, and thereby protects what it claims is the " very strong public interest " in ensuring StoresOnline complies with the terms of its undertaking.</text>

<tocase>Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/30.html</AustLII>
<text>8 In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at 29 (" Patrick Stevedores "), Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said:
 
 'Once the jurisdiction conferred on the Federal Court by the Act is invoked, that Court has power under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ... to make "orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders ... as the Court thinks appropriate". That power may be exercised in any proceeding in which the Federal Court has jurisdiction unless the jurisdiction invoked is conferred in terms which expressly or impliedly deny the s 23 power to the Court in that class of proceeding. It cannot be invoked to grant an injunction where the Court acquires its jurisdiction under a statute which provides an exhaustive code of the available remedies and that code does not authorise the grant of an injunction .' 
 (Emphasis added.)

9 An Act conferring jurisdiction upon the Federal Court may limit the scope of the Court's power under s 23 of the FCA Act by providing an exhaustive statement of the orders which the Court may make in relation to breaches of the conferring Act. The Act which conferred jurisdiction on the Federal Court in Patrick Stevedores was the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth). No " exhaustive code " limiting the range of remedies which the Federal Court could grant was found in that Act by their Honours.

10 In the present case, s 87B(4) of the TPA gives the Court jurisdiction to make any order it deems appropriate in circumstances where a respondent has breached an undertaking given to the ACCC under s 87B(1). The ACCC has approached the Court for orders compelling compliance with the undertaking. More specifically, the ACCC seeks injunctions to restrain StoresOnline from committing further breaches. There is nothing in the language of s 87B which limits the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the ACCC's application and, if appropriate on the evidence, make the orders it sees fit.

11 StoresOnline disagrees with the proposition that the TPA does not exclusively set out the powers of this Court to make injunctions in respect of relief sought under the TPA. It refers to s 80 of the TPA, which set out circumstances in which injunctions may be granted for contravention or possible contravention of specified provisions in the TPA, and submits that there can be no other source of power for this Court to grant injunctions as relief in applications made under the TPA.</text>

<tocase>Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/48.html</AustLII>
<text>6 StoresOnline submits that it has complied with most of the terms of the undertaking it gave to the ACCC, and that any breaches were minor and should not persuade the Court to exercise its discretion to grant the relief sought. It says that it has taken steps to ensure there are no further breaches. In addition, StoresOnline says that the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief, citing Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 (" Thomson ") and arguing that s 80 of the TPA is an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which injunctive relief sought under the TPA may be granted, to the exclusion of s 23 of the FCA Act . StoresOnline also submits that the balance of convenience does not favour the ACCC because there has been no material harm or prejudice to the ACCC or its purchasers; reliance on the public interest is not decisive; and the breadth of the ACCC's Amended Application travels beyond the scope and duration of some of the terms of the original undertaking.

7 Three issues therefore arise. The first concerns the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain this application and, if it sees fit, its power to grant the relief sought. The second is whether the evidence establishes breaches by StoresOnline of the undertaking necessary to invoke the power of the Court to make orders under s 87B(4) of the TPA. The final issue is whether the balance of convenience weighs in favour of granting or refusing the relief sought.

12 StoresOnline relies on Thomson as authority for the proposition that the Federal Court cannot grant injunctive relief in respect of matters under the TPA unless it does so pursuant to s 80 of the TPA, therefore rendering the ACCC's application for orders beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. It refers to the reasons of Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ, where there Honours comment at 162 on s 80 (as it then stood):
 
 '... s. 80 proceeds upon the footing that it constitutes the Federal Court's exclusive charter to grant injunctions restraining, or relating to, contraventions of the Trade Practices Act . In various sub-sections of s. 80 references are made to injunctions granted "under" the section or a particular sub-section and to applications for injunctions "granted" under the section or a sub-section see sub-ss. (1A), (4) (a) and (b), (5) (a) and (b) and (6). Section 80 makes special provision in several respects for the grant of injunctions under the section see sub-ss. (4), (5) and (6). It is scarcely to be supposed that the Parliament intended to draw a distinction in these respects between two classes of injunctions, one class of injunctions granted under s. 80 and another class granted under ss. 22 or 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act . The inference is irresistible that Parliament looked upon s. 80 as a complete and comprehensive statement of the circumstances in which injunctions might be granted in respect of relief sought under the Trade Practices Act .' 
 (Emphasis added.)

13 There are several reasons why the observations of their Honours do not mandate that this Court dismiss the present application as beyond jurisdiction. The first is that, when Thomson was decided in 1981, the TPA did not include s 87B which was later inserted by s 13 of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act 1992 (Cth). Counsel for StoresOnline invited me to infer that the insertion by Parliament of s 87B must have been done with the High Court's decision in Thomson in mind and as a guiding principle. This suggested inference is not supported by the language of the TPA itself or any extrinsic material to which I have been referred. The preferable approach, in my view, proceeds on the basis that Parliament introduced s 87B into the TPA to enhance enforcement by the ACCC by increasing the scope and flexibility of the powers of the Court to provide effective means of dealing with breaches or apprehended breaches of the TPA. The fact that Parliament granted power to the Court in s 87B(4) points to the conclusion that it did not intend the powers in relation to s 80 to be the exclusive expression of the Court's ability to grant relief of an injunctive nature. It is not correct, in my view, to regard s 87B as limited in its operation to the scope of the powers conferred by s 80.

14 The second difficulty for OnlineStores is that s 87B of the TPA regulates the particular circumstances in which an undertaking is given directly to the ACCC rather than to the Court. The Court is not involved in that process, and the undertaking is a binding agreement which arises in the context of a statutory regime. The power under s 87B is designed to give effect to and reinforce the undertaking where there has been non-compliance. The Court is given power for the purposes of more effective enforcement if the undertaking is breached. The ordinary and natural meaning of s 87B(4) is to give the Court power to better enforce undertakings by converting them into orders of the Court, and to make other orders in its discretion, if and when it becomes appropriate.

15 Section 80 is a provision invoked when there has been contravention or possible contravention of specified provisions in the TPA. Section 87B is not one of those provisions. The limitations imposed by s 80 on the ability of the Court to make " any other order ... [it] considers appropriate " under s 87B(4)(d) must, on the reasoning advanced by StoresOnline, be found to be implicit in s 80. In my view, there is no basis to imply such a limitation. Section 87B is directed to investing the Court with powers. To limit the Court's ability to grant injunctions at the request of the ACCC where undertakings given under s 87B have been breached is a non-beneficial and inappropriate interpretation of s 87B.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Santos Ltd (1992) 38 FCR 382</tocase>
<text>26 Finally, I reject the submission by StoresOnline that it should have an undertaking as to damages from the ACCC. The giving of such an undertaking is not a condition of the granting of injunctions: see Trade Practices Commission v Santos Ltd (1992) 38 FCR 382 at 388 (per Davies J). In any event, having refused to grant the blanket injunctions sought by the ACCC in paragraph [19] of its Amended Application, no significant damage should accrue to StoresOnline as it is still entitled to conduct its presentations in Australia, provided it does so within the ambit of the undertaking and the injunctions granted in these reasons.

27 As to costs, I consider that the respondents should pay the costs of the applicant in this application.

28 In giving effect to these reasons, I am of the view that it is appropriate to make orders in the form sought by the ACCC in paragraph [20] of its Amended Application, until further order, with the respondents to pay the applicant's costs. However, given the unusual circumstances surrounding this application, I direct the parties to agree Short Minutes of Order giving effect to these reasons, and to provide them to my associate no later than 5.00 pm on Friday 26 October 2007.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.
