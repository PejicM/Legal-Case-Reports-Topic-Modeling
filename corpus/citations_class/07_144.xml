<text>2 The CEPU contested the allegations made against it. The proceeding, in so far as it involved allegations against the CEPU, went to trial before Young J. On 19 December 2006 his Honour made orders declaring that the CEPU had been an accessory to the contraventions, by Edison, of ss 45E(3) and 45EA of the Act . His Honour further ordered that the CEPU be restrained for a period of three years from engaging in any repetition of such conduct directed to Edison: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Having heard further submissions relating to the quantum of penalty and costs his Honour, on 16 January 2007, ordered that the CEPU pay a penalty of $125,000 and costs of $200,000: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11. The CEPU has lodged an appeal against his Honour's decision. The appeal grounds challenge his Honour's findings in relation to liability and penalty.</text>

<text>2 The CEPU contested the allegations made against it. The proceeding, in so far as it involved allegations against the CEPU, went to trial before Young J. On 19 December 2006 his Honour made orders declaring that the CEPU had been an accessory to the contraventions, by Edison, of ss 45E(3) and 45EA of the Act . His Honour further ordered that the CEPU be restrained for a period of three years from engaging in any repetition of such conduct directed to Edison: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Having heard further submissions relating to the quantum of penalty and costs his Honour, on 16 January 2007, ordered that the CEPU pay a penalty of $125,000 and costs of $200,000: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11. The CEPU has lodged an appeal against his Honour's decision. The appeal grounds challenge his Honour's findings in relation to liability and penalty.

11 Initially, I was concerned that the imposition of a monetary penalty on Edison which was only slightly less than that imposed on the CEPU might not be in accord with the parity principle having regard to the finding of Young J that the CEPU was the instigator of the offending conduct and that the CEPU could not claim the benefit of any discount by reason of any cooperation with the ACCC's investigation or an early willingness to acknowledge liability. However, having heard argument on the point, I was persuaded that the imposition of a penalty of $120,000 on Edison would not contravene the parity principle. I have come to this view having regard to a number of factors. The first is that the CEPU was penalised as an accessory rather than a party principal. Moreover it was penalised in respect of a single course of conduct which extended over two weeks: see [2007] FCA 11 at [40] - [41] , [50]. Edison, on the other hand, committed two separate contraventions of the Act , one under s 45E and the other under s 45EA. The contravention of s 45E occurred when Edison, in August 2001, entered into the agreement with the CEPU. The contravention of s 45EA , which occurred when Edison gave effect to the agreement, involved conduct undertaken over a period of more than two years (21 August 2001 until 20 November 2003).

12 The nature of the contravening conduct to which Edison has admitted and the circumstances in which it occurred appear from the passages in the agreed statement of facts extracted above at [5]. The demand, by the CEPU, which led to the making of the offending agreement, was made at a time when Edison was peculiarly susceptible to industrial pressure by reason of pressing commercial imperatives. The principal victim of the agreement was DJN. It was unable to obtain work from Edison at the Loy Yang site for over two years. Edison was deprived of the option of engaging DJN and any other subcontractors who did not have certified agreements with the CEPU. It is not possible to quantify the losses sustained by DJN and Edison which were caused by the agreement. Those losses do not appear to have been significant in monetary terms.

13 It is necessary, in fixing an appropriate penalty, to have regard to the need to deter other companies from engaging in similar conduct. In my view a penalty of the magnitude proposed serves this purpose.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851</tocase>
<text>8 The maximum monetary penalty which may be imposed upon a corporation for a contravention of ss 45E and 45EA of the Act is, in each case, $750,000: see s 76(1A) of the Act . Edison's admissions, therefore, render it liable to a maximum aggregate penalty of $1.5m. It was submitted that an appropriate penalty, absent any ameliorative factors, was one tenth of that amount, namely $150,000. A discount of $30,000 was applied to take account of Edison's cooperation with the ACCC in the course of the ACCC's investigation and Edison's early admission of liability: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851.</text>

<text>6 The declarations, proposed by the parties, and made by the Court, identify the relevant conduct and declare that it involved contraventions of the Act . Such declarations are appropriate in circumstances such as the present. They serve the public interest by making it plain that conduct of the kind admitted by Edison contravenes the Act : see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at 333; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91.</text>

<text>9 In determining the "proper range" within which a monetary penalty for contravention of the Act falls a wide range of considerations has potential application. The Court is required, by s 76(1) of the Act , to have regard "to all relevant matters including the nature and extent of the act or omission and of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission, the circumstances in which the act or omission took place and whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under ... Part [VI] to have engaged in any similar conduct." Additional factors have been identified by the Court: see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-153; ACCC v NW Frozen Foods (1996) ATPR 41-515 at 42,444-42,445. To the extent that these factors have application in the circumstances in the present case, I have taken them into account.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1984/46.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The agreement between the ACCC and Edison had been entered into well before Young J determined that a penalty of $125,000 should be imposed on the CEPU. In these circumstances the principle of parity assumes considerable importance in determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed on Edison. That principle of parity, better known in the context of criminal sentencing, is applicable in cases such as the present: see Northwest Frozen Foods at 295. It requires, inter alia, that disparate penalties should not be imposed on co-offenders such as to engender "a justifiable sense of grievance" on the part of one of them or as to "give the appearance that justice has not been done": see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 611; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26 ; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301, 338. The tests are objective and they are to be applied "having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of [culpability]": Postiglione at 302.</text>

<text>7 The parties were agreed that a single pecuniary penalty should be imposed in respect of all of the contravening conduct. It was submitted that the appropriate amount was $120,000. The parties acknowledged that it remained a matter for the Court to make an independent judgment as to the amount of the penalty. The exercise of the Court's powers in this regard is guided by the principles outlined in the joint judgment of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 291 . Their Honours said:
 
 "There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, except in a clear case."
