<text>4 In Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 at 480, McHugh J, citing Hughes v National Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co of Australia Ltd [1978] VR 257 at 262 observed that the discretion to extend time for an appeal was for 'the sole purpose of enabling the court [or a judge] to do justice between the parties' and stated, in that context, it is always necessary to consider the prospects of success. In that case, his Honour decided that the proposed appeal in the matter before him had no prospect of success with the consequence that leave to appeal out of time was refused.

5 The grounds of appeal in the draft notice of appeal were expressed as follows:
 
 
 "GROUNDS: 
 1. The Court has not allow the applicant an adjournment to obtain further evidence required. 
 2. The Court has ignored in principal the affidavit sworn by the applicant. 
 3. The appeal is of public importance. 
 
 
 
 ORDERS SOUGHT: 
 
 
 1. To allow this appeal to go ahead. 
 2. Compensation for loss 
 3. Costs. 
 4. And any other remedy the Court will allow."</text>
