<text>In Auspine Ltd v H S Lawrence &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1749 , O'Loughlin J refused an application to cross-examine the deponent of an affidavit of discovery. He clearly accepted that there was a power to order cross-examination, but did not think it should be exercised in the circumstances of the case before him. O'Loughlin J's reasons suggest that he considered that the power should be exercised only in very limited circumstances.</text>

<tocase>AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1234.html</AustLII>
<text>I think the applicants' contention is correct. The respondents instructed Perks to carry out an analysis of the Joint Venture and Perks reached a conclusion as to the balance owing by or to the various members of the Joint Venture. No doubt that was done, in part at least, to satisfy the applicants that a proper accounting had been performed. The respondents decided to expressly waive privilege over the material they provided to the applicants. They thereby waived privilege over associated material ( AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [127] - [176] ). The class of documents in Schedule 1 Part 2 is associated material because it deals with the same subject matter as the material over which privilege has been waived and it forms the basis of that material.

I will make an order that the respondents produce for inspection the documents in Schedule 1 Part 2 of the List of Documents. Conclusion

In my opinion, an order should be made that each respondent file a further affidavit of discovery. Furthermore, an order should be made that the documents in Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Amended List of Documents filed and served on 14 October 2009 should be produced to the applicants by the respondents. I will hear the parties as to the precise terms of the orders to be made. 
 I certify that the preceding fifty-eight (58) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

<text>In Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited [2000] FCA 1389 , Moore J declined to make an order for cross-examination of a deponent of an affidavit sworn in response to an order for particular discovery. He considered that there was a power to order cross-examination, but that, as the affidavit of discovery should generally be treated as conclusive, the power should only be exercised "in order to do justice between the parties or to prevent an abuse of the Court's processes". The deponent had filed a supplementary affidavit to explain what he meant by "discarded" in his affidavit of discovery.</text>

<text>The fact that O 15A incorporates a number of processes and obligations in O 15 is established by the authorities. I refer to Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust [1999] FCA 162 (" Global Intertrade "); Tyco Australia Pty Limited v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; Imperial Chemical Industries Plc v Echo Tasmanian Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731. However, the fact that O 15A incorporates certain parts of O 15 does not mean that it incorporates all parts of the Order. Order 15A does incorporate the provisions of O 15 dealing with inspection (that is, Division 2) but that is done expressly by O 15A r 10. By contrast, O 15 r 8 is a free-standing power available in cases of discovery in existing proceedings. It is not expressly incorporated into O 15A and there is no compelling reason to think that it was intended to be available in a case where an applicant does not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in this Court, that is to say, an applicant for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6. Put another way, while it might be convenient for there to be a power of the type identified in O 15 r 8 in the case of orders for preliminary discovery, it is not so obviously necessary in such cases that it can be implied in the same way as, for example, the provisions dealing with the contents of a List of Documents (O 15 r 6).</text>

<tocase>IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1147.html</AustLII>
<text>In IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 , a deponent of an affidavit of discovery was cross-examined. The deponent of the affidavit had not opposed an order for cross-examination. Flick J described the course of allowing cross-examination as unusual. His Honour did make the following observation (at [50]): 
 
 "As events unfolded, it [cross-examination] was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided."

In my opinion, the examples given by the applicants of the insufficiency of the affidavit of discovery in relation to the five classes of documents in Schedule 2 demonstrate the insufficiency. I reject the respondents' contention that the affidavit of discovery is conclusive and that the Court is unable to make orders remedying the defects. In this case, the insufficiency of the affidavit appears on the face of the affidavit. At the same time, I do not think that this is a case where cross-examination should be ordered, at least at this stage. The respondents can be ordered to each file a further affidavit of discovery and this is not a case where there is no effective means other than cross-examination of preventing an injustice to the applicants.

Each respondent must file a further affidavit of discovery in relation to the five classes of documents in Schedule 2 of the List of Documents. Further and better discovery or an order for particular discovery under O 15 r 8 (the orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Motion)

For the reasons I have already given, I do not think that O 15 r 8 is incorporated into O 15A. In those circumstances, it is not open to me to make an order for particular discovery under O 15 r 8. Nevertheless, as I have said, an affidavit of discovery under O 15A may be insufficient, and an order may be made that a further affidavit of discovery be filed.

The principles are those set out above (see [28]-[34]). I must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for being fairly certain that discoverable documents exist. I may not have regard to a contentious affidavit.</text>

<tocase>Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/23.html</AustLII>
<text>In Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 (" Mulley v Manifold ") (at 343), Menzies J said in a well-known passage: 
 
 "So far as O. 32, r. 13 is concerned, it cannot be shown by a contentious affidavit that the discovery made is insufficient. Before 1912, it was thought that the insufficiency had to appear from the pleadings, the affidavit of documents itself or the documents therein referred to. However, in British Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers Ltd. v. Nettlefold , it was established that the insufficiency might appear not only from the documents but also from any other source that constituted an admission of the existence of a discoverable document. Furthermore, it is not necessary to infer the existence of a particular document; it is sufficient if it appears that a party has excluded documents under a misconception of the case. Beyond this, the affidavit of discovery is conclusive."

As the passage from Mulley v Manifold set out above makes clear, there are limits on the material which may be considered by a Court in determining the sufficiency of an affidavit of discovery. The most significant is that the insufficiency cannot be established by a contentious affidavit.

The insufficiency of an affidavit of discovery will ordinarily lead to an order requiring the filing of a further affidavit of discovery. It may, in certain limited circumstances, lead to an order allowing cross-examination of the deponent. I turn now to examine the circumstances in which the Court will make an order for cross-examination of the deponent.

In Fruehauf Finance Corporation Pty Ltd v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 359 , Giles J considered an application to cross-examine the deponent of an affidavit put forward in support of a claim for privilege. He referred to Mulley v Manifold and to the principle that the affidavit of discovery is generally conclusive not only as to the amplitude of discovery, but also in relation to any claim for protection from production. Giles J declined to allow cross-examination in that case. He referred to authority to the effect that there was no power to allow cross-examination and to authority suggesting that there was a power, albeit a power to be exercised in limited circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Olympic Airways SA v Spiros Alysandratos &amp; Consolidated Travel (Vic) Pty Ltd (Unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, Harper J, 26 May 1997)</tocase>
<text>In Olympic Airways SA v Spiros Alysandratos &amp; Consolidated Travel (Vic) Pty Ltd (Unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, Harper J, 26 May 1997), Harper J allowed cross-examination on an affidavit of discovery of particular documents. The case was a strong one because of the features identified in the following passage from his Honour's reasons: 
 
 "It seems to me that the evidence is at present in such a state as to raise serious doubts as to whether the process of the court is being abused by the defendants in relation to discovery. I have, of course, formed no concluded view about this. It would be quite improper for me to do so. I simply say that on the material now before the court serious questions have arisen as to the legitimacy of the position thus far taken by the defendants in relation to discovery. Discovery being of particular importance in this matter, it may well be that if the defendants are seeking illegitimately to avoid their obligations in this regard, the plaintiffs will be disadvantaged in a way which will not subsequently be able to be rectified. 
 

 
 
 The only process by which an important aspect of these proceedings can be explored at this stage is, it seems to me, by ordering the first defendant to attend for cross-examination. I appreciate that such a step is unusual."</text>
