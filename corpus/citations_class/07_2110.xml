<tocase>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Merribee Pastoral Industries Pty Limited [1998] 84 FCR 367</tocase>
<text>13 In my opinion, it is appropriate to grant a stay and to extend the injunctions: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Merribee Pastoral Industries Pty Limited [1998] 84 FCR 367.

<text>1 I made orders earlier today including orders for the discharge of injunctions previously made against each of the respondents. In order to avoid repetition and to give relevant context, these reasons ought to be read together with the reasons for making those orders: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082.

2 Immediately following the pronouncement of those orders the applicant, Clough Engineering Ltd, by an amended motion invited the Court to stay their execution and further, to extend the injunctions previously made, pending the determination of an application for leave to appeal from my judgment in respect of those orders.

3 In an ex tempore judgment I granted the stay of execution and extended the injunctions.</text>

<text>10 Such a limited stay and injunction is open to be made, although the court has ordered the dissolution of the injunctions already made: Erinford Properties Ltd v Cheshire County Council [1974] 1 Ch 261 at 267-268. It is necessary for the applicant to establish that there are reasonably arguable grounds of appeal: Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1991] HCA 59 ; (1991) 66 ALJR 219 at 220.</text>
