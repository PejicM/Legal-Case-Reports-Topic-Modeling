<text>31 As stated by the Full Court in HP Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 126 ; (2005) 143 FCR 553 at [44] :
 
 It is clear, both having regard to the modern principles of interpretation as enunciated by the High Court in cases such as CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 and s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) that the Court will prefer an interpretation of a statute which would give effect to the legislative purpose, as opposed to one that would not. This requires the Court to identify that purpose, both by reference to the language of the statute itself and also any extrinsic material which the Court is authorised to take into account.</text>

<tocase>Sterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1166</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1166.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The first instance decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1166 per Stone J, and the Full Court decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 12 ; (2006) 149 FCR 255, did not directly consider the operation of the provisions before me, and the purchase of the land there was completed before 1 July 2000, although the relevant stratum units were not registered under the relevant legislation until 2 March 2002. The focus of the Court's attention in that case was upon the operation of s 75-5(2) of the GST Act.

38 The applicant also relied upon some observations of Stone J in Sterling [2005] FCA 1166. In the course of her judgment, her Honour made the following comments:
 
 Although it is common to speak of the "stratum units" or "home units" being sold, technically it is the fee simple estate in the relevant stratum unit, being the lot(s) and common property, that is the subject matter of the sale. The fee simple is a proprietary interest in land and, as with all interests (as opposed to the subject of those interests), it is intangible. The point is made in the following extract from an essay by K Gray and SF Gray, "The Idea of Property in Law" in Land Law: Themes and Perspectives , Bright and Dewar eds, 1998 at p 15: 
 
 
 
 '[T]he beginning of truth about property is the realization that property is not a thing but rather a relationship which one has with a thing. It is infinitely more accurate, therefore, to say that one has property in a thing than to declare that the thing is one's property. To claim property in a resource is, in effect, to assert a strategically important degree of control over that resource; and to conflate or confuse this relationship of control with the actual thing controlled may often prove to be an analytical error of some substance.' 
 
 
 The attraction of the identity submission diminishes somewhat when its implications are considered. If that approach is correct, s 75-5(2) does not apply in this case because the taxable supplies acquired for the purpose of building the home units were of property that is not identical to the stratum units that were sold. It follows that the margin scheme could apply to any such development, even if the land subject to the development was acquired pursuant to a taxable supply. In other words, on the applicant's approach, a developer could buy the land, the construction materials and everything else required for the building of home units pursuant to a taxable supply and still pay GST only on the margin which, in general terms, is the difference between the costs and the sale price. It would be irrelevant whether the land was acquired before or after the commencement of the GST Act. That would not be the case, however, for a developer who bought individual lots for development as individual residences rather than for strata development. 
 ... 
 The respondent submitted that the GST Act is not concerned with whether property in land is a matter of physical fact or abstract right but rather with supplies as business transactions "made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that you carry on"; s 9-5. According to the respondent, the GST Act proceeds "on the basis that a supply of real property is a supply of tangible asset" not the disposal of an intangible interest or bundle of rights. Putting the matter another way, one can say that the applicant acquired the Camperdown land (technically the fee simple estate in the land) prior to the GST Act commencing and disposed of it after subdivision by registration of the Strata Plan and construction of the home units. The disposition was piecemeal as each stratum unit was sold but ultimately the whole of the land (or the entire interest) that was acquired was sold. The reference in s 75-15 (see [12] above) to the stratum unit supplied being a supply of "part of the land" acquired supports this practical analysis rather than a technical legal analysis. Had the latter approach been intended one might expect the section to refer to the part as being less than the whole of the interest in the land rather than to the land itself. This practical approach is consistent with the approach taken by Mason J in Moruben Gardens Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1972) 46 ALJR 559 at 562. 
 
 The respondent's approach is also supported by the role of the margin scheme and the context in which it operates as described above ... . The explanation given in the EM ... makes it abundantly clear not only that GST is only payable on value added after the GST Act commenced on 1 July 2000 but also that the cost of improvements to the property made since that date could not be taken into account when calculating the original purchase price. The EM ignores the fact that improvements may not only have added to the value of the real property but become, in law, part of the real property. It is not the juridical nature of the improvements that is critical but the fact that they have been brought about pursuant to a taxable supply. The clear thrust of the GST Act, both in its wording and as explained in the EM, is that of a practical business tax imposed with respect to elements of commerce. As Senior Counsel for the respondent pointed out, although in economic terms the burden of the GST is borne by the ultimate consumer, in terms of "imposition, collection and administration" it is a tax on business. It is for the taxpayer to prepare business activity statements and pay the appropriate GST and in this context abstract propositions about interests in land and the acquisition of a brand new set of rights arising from registration of a strata plan are irrelevant. ... [T]he applicant's submissions are not consistent with this purpose. 
 
 For these reasons I do not accept the applicant's identity submission. In my view, it therefore follows that unless the margin on which the GST is payable is to be calculated without reference to the non-land costs the application of the margin scheme would be precluded by s 75-5(2) of the GST Act.

39 The reference to the 'identity submission' was a similar submission to the one addressed above, but her Honour was not specifically dealing with the operation of s 75-10(3) or s 75-10(2), but s 75-5(2) of the GST Act. Her Honour did not consider the specific wording of s 75-10(3) or s 75-10(2), or the factual scenario before me. In my view, the comments of Stone J do not lead in this proceeding to the applicant's construction of s 75-10(3) being accepted.

40 Whilst my above conclusion as to the proper interpretation to be given to s 75-10(3) disposes of this proceeding in favour of the respondent, it is appropriate to make some further observations on submissions made by the parties in respect of this first issue.</text>

<tocase>Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 12 ; (2006) 149 FCR 255</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/12.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The first instance decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1166 per Stone J, and the Full Court decision in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 12 ; (2006) 149 FCR 255, did not directly consider the operation of the provisions before me, and the purchase of the land there was completed before 1 July 2000, although the relevant stratum units were not registered under the relevant legislation until 2 March 2002. The focus of the Court's attention in that case was upon the operation of s 75-5(2) of the GST Act.

27 However, before me the respondent contended as follows:
 
 In the present case the stratum units that were sold by way of the Supply Contracts did not exist at 1 July 2000, those legal interests only came into existence on the registration of a plan of subdivision after 1 July 2000. Accordingly, it could be contended that s 75-10(3) has no application to the present circumstances as the stratum units could not have been acquired (within the meaning of Item 1 in the table) or held (within the meaning of Item 3 in the table) as at 1 July 2000 as they did not exist at that time. 
 
 However, it is the Respondent's position that the references in s 75-10(3) to an "interest, unit or lease" should be interpreted in accordance with the principles set out by the Federal Court at first instance in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA, at [23-40] in relation to Section 75-10(2). In that case, Stone J held that, where the property was subdivided after the purchase, the acquisition cost of each unit for the purposes of s 75-10(2) was the cost of the corresponding portion of the "parent" title and it was irrelevant that the individual stratum units did not exist at the time of acquisition. 
 
 Applying these principles to the present case the Respondent contends that the stratum unit is only acquired or held on 1 July 2000, if the parent freehold title was acquired or held on that date and it is not to the point that the stratum unit interests did not exist at that time. This approach appears to have been implicitly assumed by the Applicant in its submissions.

28 My view is that the initial contention posited by the respondent is correct. Whilst the respondent sought to take a different position, I must construe the provisions as I consider they are to be properly understood as a matter of law. The failure of one party to adopt a particular interpretation cannot prevent a court from adopting that interpretation if the court considers the interpretation is correct: see generally Pearce DC and Geddes RS, ' Statutory Interpretation in Australia ' (6 th ed, LexisNexis, 2006) at [1.5].

29 The property (in the juridical sense) that was sold by way of the Supply Contracts was not the same property that was acquired or held (no matter what meaning is given to those terms). Accordingly, s 75-10(3) does not apply; the applicant did not on any view acquire or hold before 1 July 2000 the Stratum Unit which it sold, and the requirements specified in the second column of the table were therefore not met. This, in my view, is the correct way to interpret and apply s 75-10(3) and the table.

32 The margin scheme was introduced to obviate unfairness on some forms of business activity see Sterling 149 FCR at [16]. However, I cannot ignore the text of the GST Act, particularly here Div 75, and the clear wording of the operation of the provisions under consideration before me. Further, the interpretation I favour does give effect to the legislative purpose of obviating unfairness, but as confined by the words of the provisions themselves.

33 Whilst the Explanatory Memorandum to the relevant legislation talks in general terms, nowhere can the applicant demonstrate that the Explanatory Memorandum addresses the first issue before the Court. The appropriate way to consider the ambit of s 75-10(3) is to look to the text itself, keeping in mind the ordinary principles of statutory construction.

34 In my view, the table in s 75-10(3), when referring to (relevantly here) the unit acquired, refers to the corresponding 'juridical concept or intangible legal interests' referred to in s 75-5(1), namely the 'stratum unit': see Sterling 149 FCR at [21] (per Heerey, Dowsett and Conti JJ). The table specifically refers to 'the' unit. This is consistent with the approach in s 75-10(2) the margin is normally to be calculated by the comparison of the consideration for supply and acquisition in respect of the unit 'in question'. The margin scheme envisages the comparison between the same units and, for that matter, between the same interests or leases. One would readily expect this to occur so that the calculation of the margin can be determined, putting aside the identification of a date, on the basis of the acquisition and supply of the same unit, interest or lease.

35 Therefore, the margin scheme can only apply to the same property (in the juridical sense) being acquired and subsequently sold. The specific wording of s 75-10(3), of the table in s 75-10(3) and of s 75-5(2), and then the specific reference back in these provisions to the supply of the stratum unit in s 75-5(1) supports this view.

36 The applicant, in an attempt to refute the approach that the acquired property should be identical to the supplied or sold property, referred to s 75-15, which provides:
 
 
 Subdivided land 
 
 For the purposes of section 75-10, if the freehold interest, stratum unit or long-term lease you supply relates only to part of land or premises that you acquired, the consideration for your acquisition of that part is the corresponding proportion of the consideration for the land or premises that you acquired.</text>
