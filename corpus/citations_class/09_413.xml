<tocase>Haydon v Magistrates Court [2001] SASC 65 ; (2001) 87 SASR 448</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/2001/65.html</AustLII>
<text>The Full Court held that the applicability of PII was a question of substantive law, appellable on its merits and that in applying PII in civil proceedings, the Court should undertake a balancing exercise to determine whether the public interest which requires that documents privileged from production by PII should not be produced outweighs the public interest that a court of justice performing its functions should not be denied access to relevant evidence. Critically, the Full Court conformably with the reasoning in Haydon v Magistrates Court [2001] SASC 65 ; (2001) 87 SASR 448 , held that "the partial disclosure of an informer's identity, even to the person informed against, is not conclusive" and that immunity from further disclosure was not necessarily lost by the partial disclosure of informers' identities. The Full Court decided that the documents were protected from production as they did not have sufficient importance to the applicants' conduct of the litigation to outweigh the importance of not disclosing the identity of the informers.

(In the hearing of the present motions, Mr Watson said, and I accept his evidence, that the applicants and their legal advisers were unaware up until delivery of the Full Court's reasons for judgment on 4 July 2008 of the basis of ASIC's claim for PII and, in particular, were unaware that that claim rested solely on the ground of informer privilege. (I analyse his evidence later in these reasons)).

The applicants applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court. ASIC filed a summary of its argument for the purpose of the leave application. In that summary ASIC stated: 
 "The basis for ASIC's claim of public interest immunity was that various documents produced on subpoena would (directly or indirectly) identify some informants who had given ASIC information in its investigations."</text>

<tocase>D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker [1996] 2 VR 582</tocase>
<text>The present state of authorities reveals that there are two divergent views as to the circumstances in which a court will entertain a second interlocutory application in respect of the seeking of the same order as was sought in an earlier interlocutory application which was dismissed. There is: 
(a) what is said to be the strict view of Brooking and Hayne JJA in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker [1996] 2 VR 582 (" Christie ") and Mason P in Manning ;
 
 
(b) what is said to be the liberal view of Charles JA in Christie and of Heydon JA and Foster AJA in Manning .

ASIC and Multiplex submitted that a second interlocutory application will be an abuse of process if it is not based upon fresh material which was not available at the time of the original interlocutory application or a material change in circumstances since that application. In Christie , Brooking JA and Hayne JA held that as the purported new material had been available at the time of the first application and as the applicant had not offered any explanation for the reason why it was not being adduced, that the second application should have been stayed as an abuse of process. Charles JA dissented and said at 610-611: 
 "I do not think it is open to this court to adopt a rule which would preclude, as an abuse of process, the making of a second application for an extension of time simply because the applicant seeks to bring forward additional relevant facts which would not satisfy the 'fresh evidence' rule. 
 ... 

 
 ... I conclude that it is not possible for this court to adopt a rule which would preclude an unsuccessful applicant for interlocutory orders from repeating the application, on the ground of abuse of process, simply because the applicant sought to rely on additional relevant facts which did not amount to fresh evidence. Some other factor must, in my view, be present before an abuse of process is established, although, since the respondent is being faced a second time with an application for extension of time to bring proceedings, the potential for the second application to amount to an abuse is readily apparent." 

 
ASIC's written submissions asserted that Batt J's ruling in Guss v Magistrates' Court of Victoria [1998] 2 VR 113 established Christie as a rule of general application.

The applicants submitted that as a matter of principle, a second interlocutory application may be made where there has been a material change in circumstances since the original application was heard, or where there has been discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the hearing of the original application referring to Manning . The applicants submitted, however, that recent authorities suggest that the ability to make a subsequent application is not limited only to these circumstances, as has been considered in Manning . The applicants submitted that by a majority, the New South Wales Court of Appeal in that case refused to follow Christie . It was submitted that the Court of Appeal held that whether a second or subsequent application should be stayed was ultimately a matter for the discretion of the Court. Further, the applicants submitted that Christie does not stand as a general authority applicable to all interlocutory applications. Instead, the majority decision of Brooking JA and Hayne JA was said to make it clear that they were not laying down a general rule to be applied carte blanche. The decision of Mandie J in Global Realty Development Corp (a Dellaware Company) v Dominion Wines Ltd (in liq) (2005) 225 ALR 361 was cited in support of this proposition.

In Manning , Heydon JA made the following observations at 155-156, [70]-[72]: 
 "The assumptions made by Charles JA in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker as to the construction of the New South Wales legislation and the likelihood of evidence being received on interlocutory appeals appear to correspond with the approach of the New South Wales Courts. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the majority reasoning in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker should, as a matter of comity or otherwise, be followed. Rather, the position in New South Wales is such that the principles propounded by Charles JA should be applied in order to avoid an anomalous difference arising between the relative liberality with which evidence is admitted on interlocutory appeals and the extremely restrictive approach to permitting second interlocutory hearings based on additional (but not fresh) evidence urged by the Nominal Defendant. Whether Charles JA is, or the majority in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker are, correct on the true view of the Victorian legislation is not a matter that need be commented on. 

 
 For present purposes it is not necessary to go further than to reject the test proposed by the Nominal Defendant, and to decline to apply the view of the majority in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker that the applicant making a second interlocutory application is guilty of an abuse of process unless the other party is guilty of fraud or the application rests on evidence which could not reasonably have been relied on before. It is not necessary, and it is probably undesirable, to seek to define a test capable of application to all cases involving statutory extensions of time to start proceedings, or even all cases arising out of s 52(4) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 . The Nominal Defendant did not submit that if the test contended for did not exist, the conduct of the respondent constituted an abuse of process on any other basis. 

 
 Nothing in the above reasoning rejecting the Nominal Defendant's submission is intended to encourage litigants to avoid putting their best cases forward in any interlocutory application. The deliberate non-tender of evidence for use in a second interlocutory application should the first fail, or for use in an interlocutory appeal from the interlocutory application, might of itself be fatal to success; and even the non-deliberate failure to tender evidence is extremely risky. The Nominal Defendant's proposition that no second interlocutory application can be entertained unless there is a change of circumstances or unless evidence is relied on which could not reasonably have been obtained earlier is too extreme, but a litigant bringing a second application where circumstances have not changed on evidence available earlier is facing serious and self-created risks of an adverse exercise of judicial discretion. The real evils to which Hayne JA referred in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker (at 602-603) the risk of conflicting decisions, the unnecessary vexing of respondents, judge-shopping and the diminution of certainty in the conduct by respondents of their affairs and others damaging public confidence in the integrity of judicial decisions, expending time and money on litigation unnecessarily are evils which each court in its individual discretion will rightly strain to avoid."

Whilst acknowledging that there is conflict in the authorities concerning the applicable legal principles governing a second interlocutory application, ASIC submitted that the view of the majority of court in Christie and Mason P in Manning was to be preferred. This preference was said to be based on a close examination of the reasons for the divergence in views and the applicable Rules of Court in Victoria and New South Wales. ASIC submitted that the minority view of Charles JA in Christie was predicated on the basis that it would be anomalous to hold that a further interlocutory application was an abuse of process because it was based on fresh evidence that was reasonably available at the first application, when, under the applicable Rules of Court, such evidence could be adduced on appeal. In Victoria, it was said that there is no longer a requirement for "special grounds" to admit new evidence in appeals from final orders or in appeals from interlocutory orders: see Supreme Court Rules , r 64.22(3).

ASIC submitted that having regard to the rules in the Federal Court applicable to the reception of evidence in appeals from interlocutory orders, the correct approach in the Federal Court is, or should be, the strict view of Brooking and Hayne JJA in Christie and Mason P in Manning . The result is, according to ASIC, that the applicants must show that the fresh material they rely upon was not reasonably available to them on the first application or else the second application must be dismissed as an abuse of process.

To the extent that there is conflict or inconsistency between the decisions or rationes in Christie and Manning , it is not for me to resolve that conflict or inconsistency or decide which is the correct or preferable principle to adopt. I leave that exercise to more eminent judicial authority.</text>

<tocase>Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2000/80.html</AustLII>
<text>In respect of the factor of "exceptional circumstances", the observation of the majority of the High Court in Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 178 that: 
 "A court must remain in control of its interlocutory orders. A further order will be appropriate whenever, inter alia, new facts come into existence or are discovered which render its enforcement unjust ..." , 

 
is a relevant consideration. I also take into account the observation of Heydon JA in Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139 (" Manning ") at par [46]:
 
 
 "... These 'general rules' and 'ordinary rules of practice' [as to when a further interlocutory application can be made when an earlier interlocutory application has been determined] are to be administered bearing in mind the 'over-riding principle governing the approach of the Court to the interlocutory applications', namely 'that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case': Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (at 4)" , 

 
and of Palmer A-JA (with whom Mason P and Santow JA agreed) in National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 at 318:
 
 
 "...the over riding principle governing the approach of the court to the interlocutory applications is that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case: per Foster A-JA in Nominal Defendant v Manning (at 161)".

The present state of authorities reveals that there are two divergent views as to the circumstances in which a court will entertain a second interlocutory application in respect of the seeking of the same order as was sought in an earlier interlocutory application which was dismissed. There is: 
(a) what is said to be the strict view of Brooking and Hayne JJA in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker [1996] 2 VR 582 (" Christie ") and Mason P in Manning ;
 
 
(b) what is said to be the liberal view of Charles JA in Christie and of Heydon JA and Foster AJA in Manning .

The applicants submitted that as a matter of principle, a second interlocutory application may be made where there has been a material change in circumstances since the original application was heard, or where there has been discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the hearing of the original application referring to Manning . The applicants submitted, however, that recent authorities suggest that the ability to make a subsequent application is not limited only to these circumstances, as has been considered in Manning . The applicants submitted that by a majority, the New South Wales Court of Appeal in that case refused to follow Christie . It was submitted that the Court of Appeal held that whether a second or subsequent application should be stayed was ultimately a matter for the discretion of the Court. Further, the applicants submitted that Christie does not stand as a general authority applicable to all interlocutory applications. Instead, the majority decision of Brooking JA and Hayne JA was said to make it clear that they were not laying down a general rule to be applied carte blanche. The decision of Mandie J in Global Realty Development Corp (a Dellaware Company) v Dominion Wines Ltd (in liq) (2005) 225 ALR 361 was cited in support of this proposition.

In Manning , Heydon JA made the following observations at 155-156, [70]-[72]: 
 "The assumptions made by Charles JA in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker as to the construction of the New South Wales legislation and the likelihood of evidence being received on interlocutory appeals appear to correspond with the approach of the New South Wales Courts. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the majority reasoning in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker should, as a matter of comity or otherwise, be followed.

Whether Charles JA is, or the majority in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker are, correct on the true view of the Victorian legislation is not a matter that need be commented on. 

 
 For present purposes it is not necessary to go further than to reject the test proposed by the Nominal Defendant, and to decline to apply the view of the majority in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker that the applicant making a second interlocutory application is guilty of an abuse of process unless the other party is guilty of fraud or the application rests on evidence which could not reasonably have been relied on before. It is not necessary, and it is probably undesirable, to seek to define a test capable of application to all cases involving statutory extensions of time to start proceedings, or even all cases arising out of s 52(4) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 . The Nominal Defendant did not submit that if the test contended for did not exist, the conduct of the respondent constituted an abuse of process on any other basis. 

 
 Nothing in the above reasoning rejecting the Nominal Defendant's submission is intended to encourage litigants to avoid putting their best cases forward in any interlocutory application. The deliberate non-tender of evidence for use in a second interlocutory application should the first fail, or for use in an interlocutory appeal from the interlocutory application, might of itself be fatal to success; and even the non-deliberate failure to tender evidence is extremely risky. The Nominal Defendant's proposition that no second interlocutory application can be entertained unless there is a change of circumstances or unless evidence is relied on which could not reasonably have been obtained earlier is too extreme, but a litigant bringing a second application where circumstances have not changed on evidence available earlier is facing serious and self-created risks of an adverse exercise of judicial discretion. The real evils to which Hayne JA referred in D A Christie Pty Ltd v Baker (at 602-603) the risk of conflicting decisions, the unnecessary vexing of respondents, judge-shopping and the diminution of certainty in the conduct by respondents of their affairs and others damaging public confidence in the integrity of judicial decisions, expending time and money on litigation unnecessarily are evils which each court in its individual discretion will rightly strain to avoid."

It is to be noted that in National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 , Palmer A-JA said that nothing said by the majority in Manning could be construed: 
 "... as indicating a permissive or relaxed attitude of the court to the bringing of more than one interlocutory application for the same order indeed, quite to the contrary: see eg, per Heydon JA (at 156 [72])".

Whilst acknowledging that there is conflict in the authorities concerning the applicable legal principles governing a second interlocutory application, ASIC submitted that the view of the majority of court in Christie and Mason P in Manning was to be preferred. This preference was said to be based on a close examination of the reasons for the divergence in views and the applicable Rules of Court in Victoria and New South Wales. ASIC submitted that the minority view of Charles JA in Christie was predicated on the basis that it would be anomalous to hold that a further interlocutory application was an abuse of process because it was based on fresh evidence that was reasonably available at the first application, when, under the applicable Rules of Court, such evidence could be adduced on appeal. In Victoria, it was said that there is no longer a requirement for "special grounds" to admit new evidence in appeals from final orders or in appeals from interlocutory orders: see Supreme Court Rules , r 64.22(3).

ASIC submitted that having regard to the rules in the Federal Court applicable to the reception of evidence in appeals from interlocutory orders, the correct approach in the Federal Court is, or should be, the strict view of Brooking and Hayne JJA in Christie and Mason P in Manning . The result is, according to ASIC, that the applicants must show that the fresh material they rely upon was not reasonably available to them on the first application or else the second application must be dismissed as an abuse of process.

In New South Wales, however, a distinction is drawn by the legislation between appeals from final orders and from interlocutory orders. In interlocutory orders, there is no requirement for "special grounds" to adduce fresh evidence. This, it was submitted, explained why Heydon JA and Foster AJA in Manning preferred the approach of Charles JA's dissenting judgment . To this extent, it was submitted that as s 27 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) and O 52 r 36 of the Federal Court Rules draw no distinction between appeals from final orders and appeals from interlocutory orders (as per the Victorian position) that "special grounds" (or some similar exceptional circumstances) must be established to receive fresh evidence.

To the extent that there is conflict or inconsistency between the decisions or rationes in Christie and Manning , it is not for me to resolve that conflict or inconsistency or decide which is the correct or preferable principle to adopt. I leave that exercise to more eminent judicial authority.

I have concluded that the circumstances upon which the applicants rely to renew their call for production of documents pursuant to the Subpoena to Produce issued on 13 July 2007 constitute either a material change in circumstances since their original application heard before me on 11 and 17 September 2007 and since the hearing before the Full Court or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before me on 11 or 17 September 2007 or before the Full Court. I have also concluded that those circumstances constitute such exceptional circumstances as, consistently with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Manning warrant the exercise of my discretion in favour of allowing the applicants' motion filed on 16 January 2009 to be heard and determined on its merits. I am also of the view that it would be unjust not to allow the applicants to make a further application to inspect the documents produced by ASIC under the subpoena in respect of which ASIC claims privilege from production on the ground of PII: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated (supra); National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (supra) (par [39] above).</text>

<text>It has been well established for well over one hundred and fifty years that a party moving a court for an injunction ex parte, that is to say in the absence of the party against whom the order is sought, is obliged to put before the Court all the material and relevant facts and circumstances of which it is aware which bear upon the determination of the application for the relief sought: Hilton v Lord Granville [1841] EngR 827 ; (1841) 4 Beav 130 ; 49 ER 288 ; Hemphill v M'Kenna (1842) 3 Dr &amp; War 183 at 194.

<tocase>Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock [1912] HCA 72 ; (1912) 15 CLR 679</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1912/72.html</AustLII>
<text>The extent of the duty and responsibility imposed upon a party seeking an ex parte order was explained by Isaacs J in Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock [1912] HCA 72 ; (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 681-682: 
 " Dalglish v. Jarvie , a case of high authority, establishes that it is the duty of a party asking for an injunction ex parte to bring under the notice of the Court all facts material to the determination of his right to that injunction, and it is no excuse for him to say he was not aware of their importance. Uberrima fides is required, and the party inducing the Court to act in the absence of the other party, fails in his obligation unless he supplies the place of the absent party to the extent of bringing forward all the material facts which that party would presumably have brought forward in his defence to that application. Unless that is done, the implied condition upon which the Court acts in forming its judgment is unfulfilled and the order so obtained must almost invariably fall. I add the word "almost" in deference to such an exceptional case as Holden v. Waterlow . The obligation is stated by Turner L.J. in that case to be to "state their case fully and fairly," and so by Sugden L.C. in Dease v. Plunkett ...(at p.261), where he said:- "The plaintiff had not fully and fairly disclosed the entire facts of the case." Lord Cottenham L.C., in Brown v. Newall ... (at p. 579) observes that the power to grant such an injunction should exist is indispensable, but, from the liability to injustice, must be exercised with caution. Then he says:- "The Court can have no ground upon which it can proceed, in granting an ex parte injunction, but a faithful statement of the case." The learned Lord Chancellor distinguishes between mis-statement, or suppression likely to influence the Court in acceding to the application, and that which is immaterial. 

 
 In the present instance the admitted circumstances are most material: no order could have been made had they been stated, without considering and weighing them, and therefore the order for injunction was improperly obtained."

This duty of full disclosure and candour is usually found in the context of an application for an injunction but the principles and jurisprudence which underlie and warrant the performance of the duty are, in my view, equally applicable to any application made to a court ex parte for an order against a party who is either not put on notice of the application or who is excluded for one reason or another from participating in the hearing.

The performance of the duty of full disclosure by a party moving a court ex parte for orders was recently restated by Allsop J (as he then was) in Walter Rau Neusser Oel Und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd [2005] FCA 955 at [38] : 
 "In an ex parte hearing, it is the obligation of the party seeking orders, through its representatives, to take the place of the absent party to the extent of bringing forward all the material facts which that party would have brought forward in defence of the application: Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 678 at 681-82 per Isaacs J. That does not mean stating matters obliquely, including documents in voluminous exhibits, and merely not mis-stating the position. It means squarely putting the other side's case, if there is one, by coherently expressing the known facts in a way such that the Court can understand, in the urgent context in which the application is brought forward, what might be said against the making of the orders. It is not for the Court to search out, organise and bring together what can be said on the respondents' behalf. That is the responsibility of the applicant, through its representatives ." 

 
(emphasis added)
Allsop J's observation that matters should not be stated "obliquely" is of particular relevance in the present context where it is put against the applicants that they should have realised what Senior Counsel for ASIC meant when he referred "delphically" to "means and sources".

In Lane v Channel 7 Adelaide Pty Ltd [2004] SASC 47 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia said at [12]: 
 "The obligation to make proper disclosure requires the moving party not only to place before the Court all relevant matters which would have been raised by the other party if that party had been present but to make express reference to those matters. The obligation must extend so far because the ex parte procedure constitutes an exception to the rules of natural justice. Furthermore, it is not reasonable to impose upon the Court the obligation to sift through the papers for the purpose of ascertaining everything which is material to its decision whether to grant the relief sought. As Lander J said in Zadow v Tolmer Fuels Pty Ltd [(Lander J, 1 February 1995, unreported, Judgment No S5085] at [20]: 

 
 True it is that that affidavit was on the District Court file, and it is probable ... that the District Court file was before his Honour at the time that the application for leave was granted. However, it seems to me no counsel can assume that the Judge has the time to read the whole of the contents of a District Court file before the application for leave to appeal. Nor can it be assumed by counsel that a Judge can read the file, on an application for leave to appeal, knowing the matters to which he or she ought to be addressing their mind, for the purpose of determining what is material. 
 
 
 While the Court will, of course, conscientiously examine the papers, it is possible that relevant material may be overlooked, particularly given that the Court is not as familiar with all relevant facts as are the parties and it is not always immediately apparent what is relevant." 

 
See also Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (7 th ed, 2007), 496-497.

ASIC submitted that the hearing before me on 11 September 2007 could not be characterised as an ex parte hearing. It was submitted that ASIC at that stage was not an applicant but was rather a respondent seeking to resist an order which had been sought against it. ASIC submitted that no duty of full disclosure could be imposed upon a respondent.

ASIC submitted further that in any event, in the course of the ex parte hearing in camera I expressed a tentative view then a firm view which was fatal to the case which ASIC was seeking to maintain and that as a result, consideration of any wider disclosure of the identity of the whistleblowers became irrelevant, and any issue relating to disclosure of the Four Corners broadcast on 5 September 2005 was still-born. In support of this submission counsel for ASIC relied on a number of passages in the confidential transcript of the in camera hearing on 11 and 17 September 2007. I refer to those passages in the confidential appendix to these reasons which are only to be published to ASIC and its legal advisers until further order.</text>

<tocase>Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/39.html</AustLII>
<text>In respect of the factor of "exceptional circumstances", the observation of the majority of the High Court in Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 178 that: 
 "A court must remain in control of its interlocutory orders. A further order will be appropriate whenever, inter alia, new facts come into existence or are discovered which render its enforcement unjust ..." , 

 
is a relevant consideration. I also take into account the observation of Heydon JA in Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139 (" Manning ") at par [46]:
 
 
 "... These 'general rules' and 'ordinary rules of practice' [as to when a further interlocutory application can be made when an earlier interlocutory application has been determined] are to be administered bearing in mind the 'over-riding principle governing the approach of the Court to the interlocutory applications', namely 'that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case': Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (at 4)" , 

 
and of Palmer A-JA (with whom Mason P and Santow JA agreed) in National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 at 318:
 
 
 "...the over riding principle governing the approach of the court to the interlocutory applications is that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case: per Foster A-JA in Nominal Defendant v Manning (at 161)".

I have concluded that the circumstances upon which the applicants rely to renew their call for production of documents pursuant to the Subpoena to Produce issued on 13 July 2007 constitute either a material change in circumstances since their original application heard before me on 11 and 17 September 2007 and since the hearing before the Full Court or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before me on 11 or 17 September 2007 or before the Full Court. I have also concluded that those circumstances constitute such exceptional circumstances as, consistently with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Manning warrant the exercise of my discretion in favour of allowing the applicants' motion filed on 16 January 2009 to be heard and determined on its merits. I am also of the view that it would be unjust not to allow the applicants to make a further application to inspect the documents produced by ASIC under the subpoena in respect of which ASIC claims privilege from production on the ground of PII: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated (supra); National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (supra) (par [39] above).</text>

It is to be noted that in National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315 , Palmer A-JA said that nothing said by the majority in Manning could be construed: 
 "... as indicating a permissive or relaxed attitude of the court to the bringing of more than one interlocutory application for the same order indeed, quite to the contrary: see eg, per Heydon JA (at 156 [72])".
