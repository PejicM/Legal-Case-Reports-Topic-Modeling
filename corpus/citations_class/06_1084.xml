<tocase>Niemann v Electronic Industries Ltd [1978] VR 431</tocase>
<text>Further, the first respondent in written submissions cited Niemann v Electronic Industries Ltd [1978] VR 431 as authority that the following principles are applicable to the grant of leave to appeal: (a) whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court and (b) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong.

In respect of the principles in Niemann the first respondent submitted the following: &#8226; the application does not create any doubt as to the correctness of the judgment of Driver FM, much less sufficient doubt, to warrant reconsideration by this Court &#8226; no error is raised as to the approach or findings of Driver FM &#8226; Driver FM was plainly correct to dismiss the application for the reasons he did &#8226; the Court ought not to interfere with the exercise of judicial discretion in the making of an interlocutory decision unless it is satisfied that there has been some error of law or logic or some unfairness which is apparent on the face of the reasons or implicit in the result &#8226; no substantial injustice would result because there is no error in the Tribunal's decision.</text>
