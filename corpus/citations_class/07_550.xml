<text>7 
 
The application to strike out the defence was brought on the basis that it was an abuse of the process of the Court under O 11 r 16. The onus is on the party bringing the application to satisfy the court that there is an abuse of process: KC Park Safe (SA) Pty Ltd v Adelaide Terrace Investments Pty Ltd (unreported, Mansfield J, 17 September 1998). There is no exhaustive list of what would constitute an abuse of process: Sea Culture International Pty Ltd v Scoles (1991) 32 FCR 275, at 279.</text>

While it is permissible for evidence to be adduced in proceedings such as these (see Re Elders Australia Ltd; Super John Pty Ltd v Futuris Rural Pty Ltd (No 2) (unreported, Foster J, 24 December 1997); Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor [1993] HCA 66 ; (1994) 118 ALR 385, at 389; Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 109), the Court should be cautious not to preclude a party from relying on a defence that might be proved at trial merely because evidence exists which brings it into doubt: National Mutual Holdings v The Sentry Corporation (unreported, 27 September 1989); Sea Culture International v Scoles (1991) 32 FCR 275.</text>

<tocase>Remington v Scoles [1897] 2 Ch D 1</tocase>
<text>15 The plaintiff argued that the defence was an abuse of process because the substantive defence was a sham. I accept that a sham defence may amount to an abuse of process and may be struck out: see Remington v Scoles [1897] 2 Ch D 1.</text>

<tocase>Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/34.html</AustLII>
<text>16 The plaintiff sought to adduce evidence to show that the claim that the signatory to the agreement and to the mortgage on behalf of the owner did not have the requisite authority could not genuinely be raised. Obviously, the Court should be slow to be persuaded that a pleaded defence based on a matter of fact is not genuinely raised. However, if the Court is satisfied that a defendant has pleaded a fact which it does not genuinely maintain, the inference must follow that it has some extraneous reason for asserting that fact. It may be as simple as an attempt to delay the inevitable. There may be other reasons. If the fact is pleaded for an extraneous purpose, then it may amount to an abuse of process: see e.g. Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509. Care must be taken, as Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ pointed out at 526-527, to ensure that the relevant or immediate purpose is not misunderstood.</text>

<tocase>Bank of South Australia v Ferguson [1998] HCA 12 ; (1998) 192 CLR 248</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/12.html</AustLII>
<text>28 In Australian law, even if the defence of the lack of authority of Al-Enazy to have signed the documents on behalf of the owner were established, it is likely on the presently available material that
 
 (a) the owner would be required to repay the monies advanced in any event: Bank of South Australia v Ferguson [1998] HCA 12 ; (1998) 192 CLR 248; and
 (b) the owner would be estopped by its conduct from saying that the two documents were not validly executed, provided that the plaintiff showed that it had acted on the representations as to the existence of the agreement and of the agreement/mortgage.

29 No evidence exists as to whether Kuwaiti law would have the same consequences, and of course the matter in (a) would only result in the existence of an unsecured indebtedness to the plaintiff.

30 The second category of evidence takes the matter further.</text>

<text>42 The defendant and the owner should pay the costs of the notice of motion to date to the plaintiff in any event. I accept the contention of counsel for the plaintiff that those costs should be payable on an indemnity basis, given my reason for striking out the defence: see Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 per Sheppard J at 232-234.

43 I direct that the time from which any application for leave to appeal from this decision should run from the date of publication of these reasons for decision.
 I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.
