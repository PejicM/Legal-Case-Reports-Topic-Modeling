<tocase>Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1,347</tocase>
<text>26 There are a number of principles relevant to the exercise of the Court's power under s 477(2B) which are worth restating:
 
 (1) the court does not simply "rubber stamp" whatever is put forward by a liquidator. As Giles J said in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742 at 1,745 in relation to the powers of a liquidator to compromise claims: 
 
 
 "[T]he Court is necessarily confined in attempting to second guess the liquidator in the exercise of his powers, and generally will not interfere unless there can be seen to be some lack of good faith, some error in law or principle, or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's conduct. The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis. Of course, the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis, and a liquidator will be expected (as was made plain in Re Chase Corporation (Australia) Equities Ltd ) to obtain advice and, as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs, advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims. But in all but the simplest case, and demonstrably in the present case, commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of creditors." 
 
 
 (2) a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: Re United Medical Protection (No 4) (2002) 20 ACLC 1,647;
 (3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable: Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642;
 (4) in reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the Court is: 
 
 
 "[not] to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in....a hearing de novo [but]... simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up."

The Court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter;
 (5) further, in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement (whether retrospective or not), it is important to ensure, inter alia, that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a "grossly excessive profit": Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1,347 at [11] and Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1,551 at [28]; 
 (6) generally, the Court grants approval under s 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company: GDK Financial Solutions at [58] and the cases cited therein.</text>

<tocase>Seeley International Pty Ltd v Newtronics Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1862</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1862.html</AustLII>
<text>4 On 12 February 1998, Seeley commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Newtronics seeking damages arising from the supply of faulty products by Newtronics to Seeley. On 21 December 2001, the Honourable Justice O'Loughlin ordered Newtronics to pay Seeley $8.9 million together with interest and costs: Seeley International Pty Ltd v Newtronics Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1862. Interest was later fixed at $5 million.

5 On 8 January 2002, Atco served a demand upon Newtronics pursuant to a mortgage debenture and appointed receivers to Newtronics. On 26 February 2002, Mr Stewart was appointed the liquidator of Newtronics by an order of this Court on the application of Seeley. At the time of his appointment, Newtronics had no tangible assets and its creditors included Atco (in the sum of approximately $20 million but which was apparently secured), Seeley (in the sum of $19 to $20 million and which was unsecured) and other unsecured creditors (for approximately $60,000). Newtronics' assets position and principal creditors have not changed. Seeley is Newtronics' judgement creditor and remains Newtronics' largest unsecured creditor.

6 From the time of his appointment, Mr Stewart retained legal advisers to act on his behalf in relation to the liquidation of Newtronics. Initially, Mr Stewart retained Mr Rydon of Thomson Playford. That retainer was terminated on or about 22 October 2002. On the same day, Mr Stewart retained Mr Jonathon Kramersh, then a partner of Holding Redlich and from 1 February 2003, a partner of Corrs Chambers Westgarth.</text>

<text>26 There are a number of principles relevant to the exercise of the Court's power under s 477(2B) which are worth restating:
 
 (1) the court does not simply "rubber stamp" whatever is put forward by a liquidator. As Giles J said in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742 at 1,745 in relation to the powers of a liquidator to compromise claims: 
 
 
 "[T]he Court is necessarily confined in attempting to second guess the liquidator in the exercise of his powers, and generally will not interfere unless there can be seen to be some lack of good faith, some error in law or principle, or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's conduct. The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis. Of course, the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis, and a liquidator will be expected (as was made plain in Re Chase Corporation (Australia) Equities Ltd ) to obtain advice and, as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs, advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims. But in all but the simplest case, and demonstrably in the present case, commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of creditors." 
 
 
 (2) a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: Re United Medical Protection (No 4) (2002) 20 ACLC 1,647;
 (3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable: Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1,642;
 (4) in reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the Court is: 
 
 
 "[not] to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in....a hearing de novo [but]... simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up."

The Court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter;
 (5) further, in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement (whether retrospective or not), it is important to ensure, inter alia, that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a "grossly excessive profit": Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 1,347 at [11] and Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1,551 at [28]; 
 (6) generally, the Court grants approval under s 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company: GDK Financial Solutions at [58] and the cases cited therein.</text>
