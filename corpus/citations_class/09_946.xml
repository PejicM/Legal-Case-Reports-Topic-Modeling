<tocase>SZMYG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (No 2) [2009] FMCA 503</tocase>

<text>On 25 June 2009, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application for judicial review: see SZMYG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (No 2) [2009] FMCA 503. It is from that decision that the Appellant appeals to this Court. There are three grounds of appeal. They are: 
 (1) The tribunal member failed to consider carefully in relation to allegations of domestic violence and in relation to China's one child policy.
 (2) I was denied procedural fairness in connection with the making of the decision.
 (3) The tribunal does not amount to a proper basis for review in judicial review proceedings then [sic].

I shall consider each of these grounds of appeal in turn.

Ground 1 does not, in terms, specify a ground of administrative law error, much less a failure on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court to find such an error. It is important to appreciate that in matters such as the present, the Court does not exercise original jurisdiction. There is a need for an Appellant to demonstrate error of law in the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. I accept, though, that in respect of a person such as the Appellant, who is representing herself, and particularly in a case touching upon a claim for a protection visa, that a benign construction ought to be given to grounds of appeal, subject, of course, to ensuring that procedural fairness is given to the Minister, as active respondent, in meeting a ground so construed.</text>

<tocase>SZMYG v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 52</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/52.html</AustLII>
<text>The Federal Magistrates Court dealt with the question of whether there was any error, in the administrative law error sense, in respect of the factual conclusions reached by the Tribunal initially in an interlocutory judgment: SZYMG v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 52. The court found no such error. Having considered that question afresh out of an abundance of caution, having regard to a benign construction of ground 1, I can see no error in the pre-emptory way in which the Federal Magistrates Court dealt with this subject. That is because the conclusions which the Tribunal reached were reasonably open. It is nothing to the point that others may have reached different views. It is especially nothing to the point that judicial officers may have reached different views, for that would impermissibly intrude into functions consigned under our law to officers of the executive branch. However, then, one approaches ground 1, there is no merit in it.

As to ground 2, there is an absence of particularity as to how procedural fairness was denied to the Appellant in the proceedings before the Tribunal, much less how there was any error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court in dealing with such an issue. That court found there was no actual or apprehended bias evidenced in respect of the Tribunal proceedings. The only evidence of the course of proceedings before the Tribunal is to be found in the comprehensive recitation in the Tribunal's reasons of those proceedings. On behalf of the Minister, it was very properly put forward that if there were evidence of a failure to afford a hearing which was a meaningful hearing, a breach of s 425 of the Migration Act might be demonstrated.

The difficulty is there is no such breach evidenced. Further, there is no evidence of any hectoring or overly rigorous inquisition, such as might give pause for thought as to whether an apprehension of bias arose in respect of the member constituting the Tribunal, on the basis that nothing that an Appellant could say or do would change a preconception held by a Tribunal member.</text>

<text>Again very properly, the Minister's counsel, in effect, posed against the Minister whether what lay behind the allegation of a want of procedural fairness was non-compliance with a mandatory requirement found in s 424A of the Migration Act . It is evident, though, that the Tribunal did comply with that section and, indeed, perhaps went further than the strictness of that section would require having regard to what is expressed by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at [18] as in relation to the concept of "information". No error in that regard arises.

Even if one regards the ground as embracing, as a procedural fairness ground could, a failure to afford an opportunity to be heard, it is self evident that the Appellant was given such an opportunity and took advantage of it. I therefore dismiss ground 2.

Ground 3 is not, with respect to the Appellant, a meaningful ground of appeal, even approaching it in the benign way I have earlier described. At best it might be said, in my opinion, that the Tribunal had not truly considered the Appellant's visa application and that the Federal Magistrates Court should have so held. I have already decided, though, for reasons earlier given, that a meaningful opportunity was extended and that the Tribunal did comprehensively engage with the basis ultimately put forward by the Appellant for her protection visa application. I therefore dismiss ground 3.</text>
