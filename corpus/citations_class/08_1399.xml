<tocase>Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 24 ALR 577</tocase>
<text>49 Before leaving the form of orders, it is necessary to address a submission made by Murdaca that, on remittal, the AAT's findings of fact in relation to particular corporations should not be re-agitated. The way in which the AAT conducts a review of the disqualification is prescribed by the AAT Act and the authorities that have considered it. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that the question for the AAT is "not whether the decision which the decision-maker made was the correct or preferable one on the material before him . The question for the determination of the [AAT] is whether that decision was the correct or preferable one on the material before the [AAT] ": Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 24 ALR 577 at 589 and Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 at [98] - [101] . Where, as here, there is no statutory provision confining the AAT to the material before ASIC, the material before the AAT on remittal may include such information about conduct and events that occurred after the decision under review as exists at the time the AAT makes its decision : Shi .</text>

<text>14 As those earlier decisions make clear, the preconditions to the operation of the section are just that preconditions. For example, ASIC is not denied jurisdiction if the matters contained in a s 533 report have been wholly or partly rectified: Jorgensen v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 30 ACSR 481 at 483 and Dwyer v National Companies and Securities Commission (1988) 13 ACLR 716 at 720. As Heerey J said in Jorgensen , once s 533 reports have been lodged regarding two or more relevant corporations in respect of which the person was an officer within the previous seven years, the jurisdiction to make the order is established: at 483. Whether the matters in the report have been wholly or partly rectified is a matter that goes to the merits of whether ASIC, or in this case the AAT standing in the shoes of ASIC, should exercise the jurisdiction to make a disqualification order, not the existence of that jurisdiction.</text>

<text>11 "Officer" of a corporation is defined in s 9 of the Act and is in analogous terms. "Officer" includes:
 
 
 (a) a director or secretary of the corporation; or 
 
 (b) a person: 
 
 
(i) who makes, or participates in making, decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of the business of the corporation; or 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) who has the capacity to affect significantly the corporation's financial standing; or 
 
 
 
 
 
(iii) in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors of the corporation are accustomed to act (excluding advice given by the person in the proper performance of functions attaching to the person's professional capacity or their business relationship with the directors or the corporation); or ... 
A person (not a director of a corporation) may be disqualified from managing a corporation if they are otherwise involved in, or participate in, the management of the corporation in the prescribed ways. These latter capacities are sometimes described as being a "deemed director" or a "shadow director": Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526. Such descriptions can, at times, be misleading. Names and labels aside, what is required is a critical assessment of the way in which a corporation is managed and then an assessment as to whether the conduct of the person concerned falls within one or more of the categories identified.

12 Returning to the substantive provision at issue, s 206F(1)(a)(ii) specifies two conditions to be satisfied "within 7 years immediately before ASIC gives a notice under paragraph (b)(i)" (emphasis added). The conditions are: (1) the person must have been an officer of 2 or more corporations; and (2) while the person was an officer, or within 12 months after the person ceased to be an officer of those corporations, each of the corporations was wound up and a liquidator lodged a report under s 533(1) of the Act about the corporation's inability to pay its debts .

13 Section 206F , in its current form, was introduced as part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 (Cth) ("CLERP"). The predecessor to s 206F was s 600 of the Corporations Law ("the Law"). Although the language of the sections is not identical, a number of earlier decisions that considered s 600 of the Law continue to be of assistance.</text>

<tocase>Jorgensen v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 30 ACSR 481</tocase>
<text>14 As those earlier decisions make clear, the preconditions to the operation of the section are just that preconditions. For example, ASIC is not denied jurisdiction if the matters contained in a s 533 report have been wholly or partly rectified: Jorgensen v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 30 ACSR 481 at 483 and Dwyer v National Companies and Securities Commission (1988) 13 ACLR 716 at 720. As Heerey J said in Jorgensen , once s 533 reports have been lodged regarding two or more relevant corporations in respect of which the person was an officer within the previous seven years, the jurisdiction to make the order is established: at 483. Whether the matters in the report have been wholly or partly rectified is a matter that goes to the merits of whether ASIC, or in this case the AAT standing in the shoes of ASIC, should exercise the jurisdiction to make a disqualification order, not the existence of that jurisdiction.

16 Moreover, once the preconditions are met, ss 206F(1)(b) of the Act specifies what ASIC must then do. It requires ASIC to give the person a notice in the prescribed form requiring them to demonstrate why they should not be disqualified. In the present case, the notice was in the form set out in [3] above. Prior to reaching a decision, ASIC, in addition to giving the notice, must also make available to the person all the material available to ASIC on which the decision will be based and provide the person with an opportunity to respond to, make submissions and call evidence in relation to the material before ASIC: Laycock v Forbes (1997) 150 ALR 186 at 193-94. That does not necessarily mean an oral hearing: Jorgensen at 486.</text>

<text>16 Moreover, once the preconditions are met, ss 206F(1)(b) of the Act specifies what ASIC must then do. It requires ASIC to give the person a notice in the prescribed form requiring them to demonstrate why they should not be disqualified. In the present case, the notice was in the form set out in [3] above. Prior to reaching a decision, ASIC, in addition to giving the notice, must also make available to the person all the material available to ASIC on which the decision will be based and provide the person with an opportunity to respond to, make submissions and call evidence in relation to the material before ASIC: Laycock v Forbes (1997) 150 ALR 186 at 193-94. That does not necessarily mean an oral hearing: Jorgensen at 486.

41 Before reaching a decision, the decision-maker must make available to the person all the material available to it on which the decision will be based and provide the person with an opportunity to respond to, make submissions and call evidence in relation to the material before ASIC: Laycock . Provided that proper notice and opportunity to be heard are given, the fact that a relevant matter is not stated in the initial s 206F notice will not in itself provide a basis for consideration of that matter to be excluded. That obligation to provide due process is an obligation which exists separately from (though it is not unrelated to) the requirement to issue the notice. A s 206F(1)(b) notice is merely the initial way in which ASIC puts certain of those matters before the person in respect of whom a disqualification order is being considered. That view is fortified by the fact that s 206F(2) provides that ASIC is to proceed to determine whether the disqualification is justified by reference to prescribed and authorised matters including the following authorised matters:
 
 
 (i) the person's conduct in relation to the management, business or property of any corporation; and 
 
 (ii) whether the disqualification would be in the public interest; and 
 
 (iii) any other matter that ASIC considers appropriate. 
 
 
As s 206F(2)(i) expressly provides, ASIC is authorised to have regard to a person's conduct in relation to any corporation, whether or not that corporation is listed in the notice. Murdaca's complaint about the form of the notice is also without foundation.

42 Murdaca's third contention was that ASIC had to satisfy itself as to the merits of the matters contained in the s 553 reports as a precondition to the exercise of the power to disqualify Murdaca from managing a corporation. That contention is also rejected. As noted earlier (see [17]), s 206F has a structural logic and operation pursuant to which the jurisdictional analysis and merits analysis are separate.

43 Section 206F(1)(a) provides the filter if a person has been an officer of two or more corporations within the last seven years where the liquidator of each company has filed a s 533 report - then ASIC is entitled to serve a notice on that person requiring them to demonstrate why they should not be disqualified. The person served with such notice has a choice. They may take the opportunity (see [16]) to demonstrate why they should not be disqualified or they may choose to stand silent. The contents of the s 533 reports will be before ASIC. Absent a challenge to the contents of a s 533 report (in whole or in part) or material in the possession of ASIC casting doubt on the veracity of a s 533 report, I can identify no reason why ASIC should be required to conduct some further or separate enquiry to verify the matters contained in a s 533 report prepared by a liquidator of a company. If there are matters contained in a s 533 report that a person subject to a possible disqualification order seeks to challenge, then the person will have notice of those matters and an opportunity to address them.</text>

<text>36 To understand why, it is necessary to return to the basic structural provisions of the AAT Act and the authorities explaining those provisions. Section 43(1) of the AAT Act gives to the AAT "all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision...". Important consequences flow from that provision. It is all the "powers and discretions" which ASIC had when making the disqualification order, not the procedures which bind ASIC, to which the AAT accedes: cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ahmed [2005] FCAFC 58 ; (2005) 143 FCR 314 at [41] and [44]. The AAT's procedures are prescribed by s 39 of the AAT Act : see also Sullivan v Secretary, Department of Transport (1978) 1 ALD 383 at 402-403. As a result, any failure on the part of ASIC to comply with its statutory procedures will not deprive the AAT of statutory authority to deal with an application for review of the decision of ASIC. Any such defect is "cured" by the AAT when an applicant is made aware of the substance of the allegation made against them and the AAT provides them with an opportunity to respond to the allegations: eg Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at [32] .</text>

<tocase>Murdaca v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] AATA 209</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2008/209.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 29 September 2006, pursuant to s 206F(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act "), a delegate of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") disqualified the respondent, Antonio Murdaca ("Murdaca"), from managing corporations for two years ("the disqualification"). Murdaca applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT") under s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act "), for review of the disqualification. On 18 March 2008, the AAT set aside the disqualification: Murdaca v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] AATA 209.

2 ASIC has appealed to this Court, pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act , contending that the decision of the AAT is affected by several errors of law. ASIC's principal complaint is that the AAT misconstrued and misapplied s 206F of the Act . I agree. These reasons for decision identify the errors and explain why the matter will be remitted to the AAT, differently constituted, to be heard and determined according to law.

3 On 10 July 2006, ASIC issued a notice to Murdaca pursuant to s 206F(1)(b) of the Act . The notice required Murdaca to demonstrate why he should not be disqualified from managing corporations. In relevant part, it stated:
 
 
 The records of [ASIC] show that you are or were an officer of three (3) corporations that have been wound up, being:
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Australian Automotive Motor Inspection Centre Pty Ltd ACN 104 887 863 (in liquidation) ["AAMIC"];
 
 2. Amalgamated Motor Industries Pty Ltd ACN 094 472 741 (deregistered) ["AMI"];
 
 3. Market Place Properties Pty Ltd [ACN] 095 039 795 (deregistered) ["MPP"] 
 
 
 
 
 
 where a liquidator has reported under subsection 533(1) of the [Act] that each of the corporations may be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar.
 
 In these circumstances, you are required to demonstrate, in accordance with subparagraph 206F(1)(b)(i) of the Act , why you should not be disqualified from managing corporations.
 
 ...
 
 In making a decision under subsection 206F(1) of the Act ASIC is required to give you an opportunity to be heard in relation to why you should not be disqualified from managing corporations.
 
 AREAS OF CONCERN 
 
 ASIC has identified a number of concerns about your conduct which are described in Attachment "A".
 
 The documents on which these concerns are based are listed in Attachment "B".

20 The AAT decided that it was not necessary for it to consider Murdaca's involvement in AAMIC ([2008] AATA 209 at [13] and [41]). It provided three reasons:
 
(1) approximately 18 months of the 2 year disqualification period imposed by ASIC had passed;
 
(2) the decision the AAT had reached in respect to Murdaca's involvement in AMI and MPP was said to make it unnecessary to consider AAMIC; and
 
(3) s 206F(1)(a) applies only where the requirements of the section had been met and they had not. 
 
The determination by the AAT that it was not necessary to consider Murdcaca's involvement in AAMIC was an error.

21 In the present case, contrary to the third of the conclusions of the AAT set out above, the preconditions to the operation of s 206F were satisfied within seven years immediately before ASIC gave the notice under s 206F(1)(b)(i) to Murdaca, Murdaca had been an officer of three corporations (being the three corporations specified in the notice including AAMIC) and within 12 months after Murdaca ceasing to be an officer of those corporations, each was wound up and a liquidator lodged a report under s 533(1) of the Act about the corporation's inability to pay its debts. The relevant entities and dates are as follows:
 Name of Corporation Murdaca's Status Date company wound up Relevant s 533 report AAMIC Appointed sole director on 21.04.04 12.11.04 Yes. 17.05.05 AMI Director and secretary from 13.09.00 02.01.03 04.03.03 Yes. 08.03.05 MPP Director from 10.11.00 02.01.03 04.03.03 Yes. 12.10.04

22 The preconditions of s 206F(1) having been satisfied, ASIC's jurisdiction (and the jurisdiction of the AAT standing in ASIC's shoes) under s 206F(2) was enlivened regardless of whether it later turned out that s 533 reports in respect of one or even all of the corporations in question had been lodged erroneously. What is relevant for purposes of s 206F(1) , as noted earlier, is no more and no less than the mere fact that the reports had been lodged and contained statements to the effect that it appeared that the company in question might be unable to pay more than 50 cents in the dollar to its unsecured creditors. The AAT was thus not entitled to exclude Murdaca's involvement in AAMIC from consideration on the basis that, because the s 533 reports in respect of MPP and AMI were erroneous or should not have been lodged, there were less than the two corporations required by s 206F(1) and thus the jurisdiction under s 206F(2) was not enlivened. What impact or significance should attach to Murdaca's conduct in relation to AAMIC in the context of the making of a disqualification order is ultimately a matter for the AAT when the matter is remitted to it to be determined according to law. On remittal, the AAT may yet decide that Murdaca's involvement in AAMIC is not relevant to, or does not justify, disqualification; the point here is only that it cannot do so on the basis that it lacks jurisdiction. The contrary view expressed by the AAT in the decision under review reveals that the AAT failed to properly construe s 206F(1)(a)(i) and that error may have affected the result below.

23 The AAT decided that MPP was not a company that fell within s 206F(1)(a)(ii) because the AAT was satisfied that, contrary to the contents of the s 533 report lodged with ASIC in respect of MPP, there were no creditors of MPP. As a result, the AAT concluded that the liquidator of MPP had incorrectly reported to ASIC under s 533 of the Act when a condition for the operation of s 533 of the Act (that it appear that MPP might be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar) had not been fulfilled.

24 In this respect, the AAT failed to properly construe s 206F(1)(a)(ii) and s 533(1)(c) of the Act .

28 Delitat and TMVP were not subjects of the notice issued by ASIC under s 206F(1)(b) of the Act . As a result, the AAT decided that they could not "arise for consideration for disqualification". The AAT went on to state that "their relevance was related to the justification for disqualification and the period of that disqualification, if that became necessary": [2008] AATA 209 at [5] .

29 The AAT's reasons for decision on this aspect of the matter are by no means clear. It appears that the AAT accepted that it had a discretion to consider Delitat and TMVP under ss 206F(1)(c) and 206F (2), but not under s 206F(1)(a). To the extent that the AAT intended to suggest that because the notice (see [3] above) did not refer to Delitat and TMVP it was not open to the AAT to have regard to Murdaca's involvement in these two latter corporations for purposes of the jurisdictional analysis, that is an error of law for the reasons set out in [39]-[41] below.

30 Moving to the merits analysis, the preconditions to the operation of s 206F having been satisfied, the Delitat and TMVP circumstances were, as the AAT appears to have accepted, relevant to its consideration of whether to exercise the disqualification power under ss 206F(1)(c) and 206F (2). As with AAMIC, the significance to be attached to Murdaca's conduct in relation to Delitat or TMVP in the context of the making of a disqualification order is ultimately a matter for the AAT when the matter is remitted to it to be determined according to law.</text>

10 The phrase "managing corporations" is addressed in s 206A of the Act . It provides in s 206A(1) that a person disqualified from managing corporations under Pt 2D.6 commits an offence if:
 
 
 
 (a) they make, or participate in making, decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of the business of the corporation; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) they exercise the capacity to affect significantly the corporation's financial standing; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) they communicate instructions or wishes (other than advice given by the person in the proper performance of functions attaching to the person's professional capacity or their business relationship with the directors or the corporation) to the directors of the corporation: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) knowing that the directors are accustomed to act in accordance with the person's instructions or wishes; or 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) intending that the directors will act in accordance with those instructions or wishes.</text>
