<text>38 Although Brennan J expressed a narrower view than Mason and Wilson JJ on the question of when legal professional privilege attaches to confidential professional communications between government agencies and salaried legal officers, their Honours were in agreement as to the need in every case for the legal adviser to be "independent" (see also Deane J at p 80).

<tocase>Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/237.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The parties were in agreement that the appropriate test to be applied in determining whether or not the respondents have waived privilege in the external legal advice referred to in the letter of 19 April 2005 is whether they have in effect disclosed the substance or conclusion of that advice. The test was expressed this way by Gyles J, with whom Tamberlin J agreed, in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at [65] where his Honour said:
 
 ... The voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion.

30 In his additional observations in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service , Tamberlin J at [13] said:
 
 Various expressions are used in the formulation of principles relating to waiver of legal professional privilege, such as references to 'the substance', 'effect', or 'content' of the advice. The weight of the authorities, in my view, supports the conclusion that the disclosure of the conclusion reached in or course of action recommended by, an advice can amount to waiver of privilege in respect of the premises relating to the opinion which has been disclosed, notwithstanding that this reasoning is not disclosed. By way of illustration, if there is a disclosure that a client has been advised that interpretation 'A' is preferable to interpretation 'B' of a legislative provision, then even if there is no disclosure of the reasoning leading to that conclusion, the reasoning and content of the advice may be waived, including the factual premises and circumstances leading to that conclusion.
 

His Honour had earlier observed that it "may perhaps have been different" if it had simply been asserted that, in effect, the client had taken legal advice and thereafter adopted a particular position.

31 The critical question concerning the letter dated 19 April 2005 is thus its proper construction. For this reason only limited assistance is provided by consideration of the facts of other cases. It is necessary for me to form a view, after consideration of the whole of the letter of 19 April 2005, as to whether the respondents by that letter deployed the substance or effect of their external legal advice for forensic purposes. Assuming for present purposes the correctness of the proposition tentatively advanced by Tamberlin J (see [30] above), there would have been no waiver if the letter simply asserted, in effect, that PwC had taken legal advice and thereafter acted from 2 July 2004 in the way complained of by Ms Rich.

32 In my view, a fair reading of the letter of 19 April 2005 leads to the conclusion that it was calculated to convey the message that the conduct of PwC from 2 July 2004 was undertaken on external advice and in accordance with that advice, and, for that reason, PwC did not believe that there had been any victimisation or other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought. This conclusion can, it seems to me, be tested by asking whether, were it the case that PwC had acted in disregard of its external advice, or were it the case that its belief that there had not been any victimisation or other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought was inconsistent with its external advice, would the letter have been misleading? In my view, it is plain that it would have been. The statement that PwC had "acted at all times with the benefit of external advice" was apparently made for the purpose of fortifying the claim that it had not engaged in victimisation, or in other conduct for which compensation could properly be sought. Implicit in the calling-in-aid of the external legal advice for this purpose was the claim that the external legal advice supported the conduct of PwC.

33 I therefore reject the submission of the respondents that the letter does not disclose the substance or conclusion of the external advice received by the respondents and that the statement in the letter reproduced in [18] above amounts to a simple assertion that the client has taken legal advice and has acted with the benefit of it.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/86.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 the Full Court gave careful consideration to modern authorities, including recent judgments of the Full Court of this Court, on issue waiver. It is not necessary for me to refer extensively to what their Honours there said as they summarised their conclusions at [60]-[61]. At [60] their Honours emphasised that the authorities reveal that whether or not privilege has been waived will in every case depend very much on the particular circumstances of the case. At [61] their Honours identified the governing principle in the following way:
 
 Both before and after Mann , the governing principle required a fact-based inquiry as to whether, in effect, the privilege holder had directly or indirectly put the contents of an otherwise privileged communication in issue in litigation, either in making a claim or by way of defence. In DSE [ie DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; (2003) 127 FCR 499] [58], Allsop J put the matter somewhat more descriptively, saying waiver arises when 
 
 
 
 "the party entitled to the privilege makes an assertion (express or implied), or brings a case, which is either about the contents of the confidential communication or which necessarily lays open the confidential communication to scrutiny and, by such conduct, an inconsistency arises between the act and the maintenance of the confidence, informed partly by the forensic unfairness of allowing the claim to proceed without disclosure of the communication" (emphasis in original).</text>

At [121] his Honour noted that his views were in conformity with those of Wheeler J in Commonwealth v Ternwood Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] WASC 107 at 10 where her Honour said:
 
 ... it is the conduct of the party who possesses the privilege which is capable of waiving it. It is not apparently open to another party to litigation to force waiver of a party's legal professional privilege by making assertions about, or seeking to put in issue, that party's state of mind.</text>

<tocase>Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/67.html</AustLII>
<text>4 The common law of legal professional privilege (or client legal privilege as it has commonly been called since the enactment of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)) provides the test for determining whether confidential written communications between lawyer and client must be produced for inspection ahead of trial ( Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 (" Esso Australia ")).

5 Client legal privilege protects the confidentiality of certain communications, which may be but need not be written, made in connection with giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services. The communications accorded protection are those made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation in reasonable prospect ( Esso Australia per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [61]).

6 Client legal privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers. As Mason and Wilson JJ stated in Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 ( "Waterford" ) at 62, "the proper functioning of the legal system is facilitated by freedom of consultation between the client and the legal adviser". Their Honours went on to observe at pages 64-65 that legal professional privilege is the product of a balancing exercise between competing public interests whereby, subject to the well-recognised crime or fraud exception, the public interest in the administration of justice is accorded paramountcy over the public interest in a fair trial conducted by reference to all relevant documents (see also Esso Australia per Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [35]). There is no further balancing exercise to be carried out; if client legal privilege attaches to a communication, the privilege may be waived or overridden by statue but is otherwise absolute ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 ( "Telstra" ) at [21]).</text>

<tocase>Goldberg v Ng in Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253</tocase>
<text>78 The respondents argued that, even if there were not a sufficient identity of interest between Mr Harrington and Mr Edwards, it does not automatically follow that the limited disclosure to Mr Harrington resulted in a waiver of privilege in the advice against the rest of the world. They placed reliance in particular on the majority judgment in Mann v Carnell at [30] where their Honours said:
 
 In Goldberg v Ng this Court considered a case in which there was disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party, for a limited and specific purpose, and upon terms that the third party would treat the information disclosed as confidential. The Court was divided upon whether, in the circumstances of the case, privilege was waived. However, the reasoning of all members of the Court was inconsistent with the proposition that any voluntary disclosure to a third party necessarily waives privilege. No application was made on the present appeal to re-open Goldberg or any of the earlier authorities on the subject. In Goldberg , reference was made to the statement of Jordan CJ in Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council :
 
 
 
 "The mere fact that a person on some one occasion chooses to impart to another or others advice which he has received from his solicitor indicates no intention on his part to waive his right to refuse on other occasions to disclose in evidence what that advice was, and supplies no sufficient reason for depriving him of a form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client". (Citations omitted)

79 Shortly before the publication of the High Court's judgment in Mann v Carnell , Sackville J had followed Goldberg v Ng in Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253. At [44] his Honour said:
 
 In my view, the mere fact that otherwise privileged communications at the meeting took place in the presence of persons who did not represent clients of [a legal firm], does not justify a conclusion that the ARU had expressly or intentionally waived privilege in those communications. The disclosure of the privileged communications was to a limited group, namely those attending the meeting. While there is no evidence of an express undertaking by the non-clients present at the meeting to preserve confidentiality, the circumstances suggest that the non-clients were under an implied obligation to respect the confidentiality of the communications at the meeting.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>9 At common law a person who would otherwise be entitled to the benefit of client legal privilege will waive that privilege, perhaps unintentionally, if he or she engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege protects ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ at [28]).

10 A central allegation made by Ms Rich is that, by imposing access restrictions on her, the first respondent, Mr Harrington, the Country Senior Partner for Australia, acting on behalf of the partners of PwC who answer the description of "Management" in the Partnership Deed ("the Management"), and with the subsequent approval of the Board of Partners ("the Board"), committed an act of victimisation against her within the meaning of s 94 of the Sex Discrimination Act .

11 Section 94(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act relevantly provides:
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to commit an act of victimization against another person if the first mentioned person subjects, or threatens to subject, the other person to any detriment on the ground that the other person: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) has made, or proposes to make, a complaint under this Act or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 ;
 (b) has brought, or proposes to bring, proceedings under this Act or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 against any person;
 ...
 
 (d) has attended, or proposes to attend, a conference held under this Act or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 ;
 ...
 (f) has reasonably asserted, or proposes to assert, any rights of the person or the rights of any other person under this Act or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 ; or
 (g) has made an allegation that a person has done an act that is unlawful by reason of a provision of Part II ; 
 
 
 
 
 or on the ground that the first-mentioned person believes that the other person has done, or proposes to do, an act or thing referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (g), inclusive.

20 The form of implied waiver that Ms Rich seeks here to invoke is known as "issue waiver". In Mann v Carnell at [29] the majority of the High Court stated the governing principle concerning waiver of privilege as follows:
 
 Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is "imputed by operation of law". This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege. ... What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large. (Citation omitted)

21 In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 the Full Court gave careful consideration to modern authorities, including recent judgments of the Full Court of this Court, on issue waiver. It is not necessary for me to refer extensively to what their Honours there said as they summarised their conclusions at [60]-[61]. At [60] their Honours emphasised that the authorities reveal that whether or not privilege has been waived will in every case depend very much on the particular circumstances of the case.

29 At [68] his Honour, after referring to Australian Unity Health Ltd v Private Health Insurance Administration Council [1999] FCA 1770 ; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee (Canberra) Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 12; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 137 ALR 28 at 34; [1996] HCA 15 ; 70 ALJR 603 at 607 per Kirby J; Adelaide Steamship Company Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 at 366 367; BT Australasia Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 7) (1998) 153 ALR 722 at 743 744; BT Australasia Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 207 and Mann v Carnell observed:
 
 ... The test looks to inconsistency between the disclosure that has been made by the client on the one hand and the purpose of confidentiality that underpins legal professional privilege on the other. It is not a matter simply of applying general notions of fairness as assessed by the individual judge. The authorities to which I have referred show that it is well established that for a client to deploy the substance or effect of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that attracts legal professional privilege.

78 The respondents argued that, even if there were not a sufficient identity of interest between Mr Harrington and Mr Edwards, it does not automatically follow that the limited disclosure to Mr Harrington resulted in a waiver of privilege in the advice against the rest of the world.

<tocase>National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203</tocase>
<text>7 It is not sufficient for a party merely to assert a claim for client legal privilege; the party making the claim must establish the facts giving rise to the privilege ( National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211). Where the claim is made in respect of a document, the Court has power to examine the document for itself ( National Crime Authority v S at 211). I interpolate that in this case, to avoid the risk of my seeing privileged communications that might render it impossible or undesirable for me to be the trial judge, I have undertaken not to examine any document in respect to which privilege is claimed without first hearing from the parties. If, having done so, I am persuaded that it is necessary for the Court to examine the document but that it would be inappropriate for me to do so, another judge will be asked to determine the status of the document in question.</text>

<tocase>Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 672</tocase>
<text>42 Ms Rich did not argue that a salaried, or in-house lawyer, necessarily lacks the independence necessary for client legal privilege to attach to his or her advice. Rather she placed reliance on the approach adopted by Graham J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2005) 225 ALR 672 at [15] where his Honour said:
 
 In my opinion, an in-house lawyer will lack the requisite measure of independence if his advice is at risk of being compromised by virtue of the nature of his employment relationship with his employer. On the other hand, if the personal loyalties, duties and interests of the in-house lawyer do not influence the professional legal advice which he gives, the requirement for independence will be satisfied.

44 In arguing that OGC was in a position to provide independent advice to them, the respondents placed weight on the following passages from the reasons for judgment of Tamberlin J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2005] FCA 142 concerning documents generated by an in-house counsel:
 
 
 4. The dominant purpose test has particular importance in relation to the position of in-house counsel because they may be in a closer relationship to the management than outside counsel and therefore more exposed to participation in commercial aspects of an enterprise. The courts recognise that being a lawyer employed by an enterprise does not of itself entail a level of independence. Each employment will depend on the way in which the position is structured and executed. For example, some enterprises may treat the in-house adviser as concerned solely in advising and dealing with legal problems. As a matter of commercial reality, however, both internal and external legal advisers will often be involved in expressing views and acting on commercial issues. 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. The authorities recognise that in order to attract privilege the legal adviser should have an appropriate degree of independence so as to ensure that the protection of legal professional privilege is not conferred too widely. Commercial reality requires recognition by the courts of the fact that employed legal advisers not practising on their own account may often be involved to some extent in giving advice of a commercial nature related to the giving of legal advice. Such involvement does not necessarily disqualify the documents relating to that role from privilege. The matter is necessarily one of fact and degree and involves a weighing of the relative importance of the identified purposes. 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 38. ... I am cognisant of the fact that there is no bright line separating the role of an employed legal counsel as a lawyer advising in-house and his participation in commercial decisions. In other words, it is often practically impossible to segregate commercial activities from purely "legal" functions. The two will often be intertwined and privilege should not be denied simply on the basis of some commercial involvement. In the present case, however, I am persuaded that Mr Philip was actively engaged in the commercial decisions to such an extent that significant weight must be given to this participation. In many circumstances where in-house counsel are employed there will be considerable overlap between commercial participation and legal functions and opinions. As can be seen from the specific rulings below, I am not persuaded that in this proceeding Mr Philip was acting in a legal context or role in relation to a number of the documents in respect of which privilege was claimed. Nor am I persuaded that the privilege claims were based on an independent and impartial legal appraisal.

45 In reliance on the above passages the respondents submitted as follows:
 
 A reading of these passages ... shows that when Tamberlin J was referring to 'independence', his Honour was focussing specifically on the issue of whether the in-house lawyer is, in generating the particular communication or document, performing a legal function distinct from (that is, independent of) the commercial activities or management of the client. That is, 'independence' has to be determined having regard to whether or not the person in question was performing a legal function (rather than a commercial or management function) in making a communication or preparing a document.
 
 The decision is not authority for the proposition that an in-house lawyer is, prima facie, someone who is not independent of the client. Nor is it authority for the proposition that, where there is some issue about independence in the sense outlined above, none of the documents generated by the in-house counsel can attract privilege. Instead, as the analysis of the documents generated by Mr Phillip shows, privilege can still be maintained in all documents generated in a legal context, or which embody or refer or relate to legal advice.

46 I am not persuaded that Tamberlin J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd intended to conflate the criteria for a claim of client legal privilege in the way suggested by the above submissions. The requirement that the legal adviser be independent is principally concerned with the nature of the relationship between the client who claims client legal privilege and the legal adviser. The requirement that the communication be made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation in reasonable prospect is concerned with the object and subject matter of the communication. Each criterion must be satisfied before a claim for client legal privilege will succeed.

47 I therefore turn to consider the evidence concerning the nature of the relationship between OGC, Ms Rich and the respondents. The person directly responsible for the legal advice and other legal services provided by OGC is the holder of the position of General Counsel. At all relevant times the holder of the position of General Counsel has been a partner in PwC. Elizabeth Jane Dibbs, solicitor, was General Counsel for the period from 1 July 1998 until her retirement in December 2004. At all times while she was General Counsel she held a current practicing certificate and each of the solicitors in OGC also held a current practicing certificate. Ms Dibbs' successor as General Counsel was Meredith Kim Beattie, solicitor. Prior to joining PwC on 8 February 2005, Ms Beattie had been a partner in the legal firm Blake Dawson Waldron for almost 16 years. She has maintained her practicing certificate as General Counsel and each of the solicitors in OGC continues to hold a practicing certificate.

48 I accept the evidence of Ms Dibbs and Ms Beattie concerning the general functioning of OGC. Their evidence demonstrated that OGC operates as a separate functional unit with PwC. Both Ms Dibbs and Ms Beattie have regarded it as essential that OGC operate on a professional basis, providing professional legal advice and services to PwC with the same level of objectivity as would external lawyers. Separate files are opened within OGC and marked accordingly. Working documents and current files are either kept in a separate and secure OGC area or in lawyers' offices capable of being locked. OGC is separately located on an administrative floor away from the business units of PwC. Neither Ms Dibbs nor Ms Beattie has held any management or executive positions at PwC, nor have any of the other solicitors in OGC. Nonetheless, Ms Howard, the Deputy General Counsel, has fulfilled the role of secretary to the Board of partners and was (perhaps is) a member of the Partnership Amendment Review Committee. In both capacities Ms Howard's role has been to provide professional legal advice and legal services and incidental administrative services such as preparing agendas and collating papers.</text>

<text>6 Client legal privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers. As Mason and Wilson JJ stated in Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 ( "Waterford" ) at 62, "the proper functioning of the legal system is facilitated by freedom of consultation between the client and the legal adviser". Their Honours went on to observe at pages 64-65 that legal professional privilege is the product of a balancing exercise between competing public interests whereby, subject to the well-recognised crime or fraud exception, the public interest in the administration of justice is accorded paramountcy over the public interest in a fair trial conducted by reference to all relevant documents (see also Esso Australia per Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [35]). There is no further balancing exercise to be carried out; if client legal privilege attaches to a communication, the privilege may be waived or overridden by statue but is otherwise absolute ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 ( "Telstra" ) at [21]).

43 Graham J has more recently adopted the same approach in Telstra at [35]. In Telstra his Honour concluded at [36]-[39] that as no evidence had been adduced going to the independence of the relevant internal legal advisers no sufficient claim for legal professional privilege had been made. I reject the submission of Ms Rich that the respondents in this case have similarly adduced no real evidence going to the independence of OGC. I refer below to the evidence touching on the independence of OGC.</text>

<tocase>The Queen (Brooke and Another) v Parole Board and Others [2007] EWHC 2036 (Admin)</tocase>
<text>40 The content of the requirement that a legal adviser be independent is understandably less stringent than the requirement that, for example, a judge be independent. However, it is informed by the same notions of absence of fear or favour. The concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked ( The Queen (Brooke and Another) v Parole Board and Others [2007] EWHC 2036 (Admin) at [19]). An independent legal adviser is one who can bring a disinterested mind to bear on the subject matter of the legal advice. In the words of Brennan J in Waterhouse , what is required is a legal adviser who is able to be "professionally detached" in giving the advice.

41 Ms Rich submitted, in effect, that (a) the independence of legal advice provided by OGC could not rise above the independence of the person who holds the position of General Counsel because that person supervises, and carries responsibility for, the work of OGC; and (b) since at all relevant times General Counsel has been a partner in PwC, OGC's legal advice has not been independent because General Counsel has been both legal adviser and client. I have not found it necessary to form a concluded view as to the validity of the second part of this broad submission although the first part seems to me to be correct. For present purposes it is sufficient for me to reach a view on whether, having regard to the nature of the dispute between Ms Rich and PwC that forms the subject matter of this proceeding, the relationship between OGC and PwC was a professional relationship which secured OGC's advice an independent character notwithstanding that General Counsel, and one other senior solicitor in OGC, were partners in PwC.</text>

<text>6 Client legal privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers. As Mason and Wilson JJ stated in Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 ( "Waterford" ) at 62, "the proper functioning of the legal system is facilitated by freedom of consultation between the client and the legal adviser".

36 In Waterford Mason and Wilson JJ, in giving consideration to whether it was open to the Commonwealth to claim legal professional privilege in respect of legal advice obtained from employed solicitors within Government, observed at p 62:
 
 To our minds it is clearly in the public interest that those in government who bear the responsibility of making decisions should have free and ready confidential access to their legal advisers. Whether in any particular case the relationship is such as to give rise to the privilege will be a question of fact. It must be a professional relationship which secures to the advice an independent character notwithstanding the employment.

37 Brennan J in Waterford similarly stressed the need for the legal adviser to be independent at p 70 where his Honour said:
 
 The purpose of legal professional privilege is to facilitate the seeking and giving of legal advice and thereby to ensure that the law be applied and litigation be properly conducted ... If the purpose of the privilege is to be fulfilled, the legal adviser must be competent and independent. Competent, in order that the legal advice be sound and the conduct of litigation be efficient; independent, in order that the personal loyalties, duties or interests of the adviser should not influence the legal advice which he gives or the fairness of his conduct of litigation on behalf of his client. If a legal adviser is incompetent to advise or to conduct litigation or if he is unable to be professionally detached in giving advice or in conducting litigation, there is an unacceptable risk that the purpose for which privilege is granted will be subverted. (Citations omitted) 
 

I interpolate that no issue of incompetence arises in this case.

38 Although Brennan J expressed a narrower view than Mason and Wilson JJ on the question of when legal professional privilege attaches to confidential professional communications between government agencies and salaried legal officers, their Honours were in agreement as to the need in every case for the legal adviser to be "independent" (see also Deane J at p 80). See also Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd v Customs and Excise Commissioners (No 2) [1972] 2 QB 102 per Lord Denning MR at 129.

39 I do not understand the other members of the High Court in Waterford to have suggested a different rationale for the requirement of independence from that identified by Brennan J in the above passage. His Honour's reference to professional detachment is consistent with the ordinary meaning of "independent". The Macquarie Dictionary (online version) relevantly defines "independent" in the following ways:
 
 
 1. not influenced by others in matters of opinion, conduct, etc; thinking or acting for oneself: an independent person 
 2. not subject to another's authority or jurisdiction; autonomous, free.
 3. not influenced by the thought or action of others;
 independent research .....
 
 

The Oxford English Dictionary defines "independent" in a comparable way.</text>
