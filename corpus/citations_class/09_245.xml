<tocase>Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1994) 125 ALR 151</tocase>
<text>The test for validity of a legislative instrument is "whether there is a 'real connection' between the delegated legislation and the purpose for which the Parliament conferred the authority to make the law under challenge": Gummow J in Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1994) 125 ALR 151 at 163.

The applicant contends that the "Relative Price Factor" derived for a fishing permit package for the northern inshore and Area E areas of the Fishery in item 5 in the table in s 32 of the Management Plan was derived by a method that was irrational, unreasonable and capricious, and was against the weight of evidence and submissions to the Authority, with the consequence that item 5 should be declared invalid.

For the reasons which follow, the applicants' challenge to s 32 of the Management Plan fails, and the declaration of invalidity they seek will be refused. The Fishery

And to the observation of Gummow J in Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1994) 125 ALR 151 , at 166: 
 ... Great caution must be shown in judicial review ... of determinations resting upon factual matters where (i) the determinations in question were made after prolonged public debate and (ii) being legislative in character, the determinations were subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament and (iii) the disputed matters of fact turn upon expert knowledge and opinion, there is dispute between the experts, and there was no cross examination upon that conflict.

In Bienke , Gummow J was concerned with a challenge by the owners of prawn trawlers to a management plan for the Northern Prawn Fishery promulgated in 1989. The applicants argued, amongst other things, that a number of determinations by the relevant Minister relating to the plan and changes to it were ultra vires and unreasonable. It was also said that the plan was invalid, on the basis that it deprived the applicants of the ability to fish, which was, in effect, the indirect acquisition of property without providing for just terms as required by the Constitution . A "just terms" compensation claim was pleaded in the present case, but abandoned by the applicants.</text>

<tocase>Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine v Australian Port Ltd and Others [2005] FCAFC 206</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/206.html</AustLII>
<text>In Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine v Australian Pork Ltd and Others [2005] FCAFC 206 ; (2005) 146 FCR 368 , the Full Court of the Federal Court was concerned with the review of an administrative decision to grant a Permit to import pig meat, pursuant to the ADJR Act. It was contended that the recommendation of the Import Risk Analysis Report was infected by Wednesbury unreasonableness.

The nature of the decision making function in that case was described by Heerey and Lander JJ at 382, [61]: 
 The legislation does not suggest that quarantine decisions are to be made on an assumption that every scientific fact is known about every conceivable disease or pest that might be introduced into Australia, or that such decision are to be delayed until all such facts are discovered and accepted. On the contrary, quarantine decisions have to be made in the existing state of knowledge. Imponderables have to be weighed and value judgements made. No specific criteria are laid down, other than the condition to be established must limit the level of quarantine risk to one which is "acceptably low" which necessarily assumes there will be some risk.

At [63], Heerey and Lander JJ said: 
 ... If in some steps, or sub-steps, of the process in relation to PMWS the Panel used estimate, or analogy, or indeed speculation, the Panel might be guilty of unscientific procedures. However APL had to show that the ultimate decision was not just unreasonable, but so unreasonable that no other similarly qualified decision-maker would have made it. That test necessarily allows for some degree of unreasonableness. Even if error in reasoning is disclosed, a conclusion of Wednesbury unreasonableness requires a major step further. 
 (Emphasis added).

In the case of a legislative instrument, such as the present, the matter has to go even further than Wednesbury unreasonableness.

The observations of their Honours at 371, [4] have a resonance to the present proceedings: 
 ... That process involved fact finding and the making of value judgments and risk assessments in a complex scientific setting. The good faith and scientific competence of those engaged in the task is not in question. While there is room for debate as to some aspects of the IRA Report, the Panel did not carry out its task irrationally or unreasonably. The Court is not empowered to adjudicate on the factual correctness or otherwise of the IRA Report.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Primary Industries &amp; Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 45 ; (1993) 40 FCR 381</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/45.html</AustLII>
<text>Spigelman CJ referred, at [133] to the observations of Lockhart J in Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 45 ; (1993) 40 FCR 381 at 384: 
 Delegated legislation may be declared to be invalid on the ground of unreasonableness if it leads to manifest arbitrariness, injustice or partiality; but the underlying rationale is that legislation of this offending kind cannot be within the scope of what Parliament intended in authorising the subordinate legislative authority to enact law.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey (1993) 47 FCR 151</tocase>
<text>Gummow J noted, at 155, that the common law right or liberty to fish in the sea and in tidal navigable rivers is a public not a proprietary right, and as such, is amendable to abrogation or regulation by legislation, citing Minister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey (1993) 47 FCR 151 at 160, 168-9.

In the context of the present case it is helpful to recall that par 7 of the Northern Fisheries Plan then under challenge set out the objectives and measures for obtaining them. Subparagraphs 7.1 and 7.2 stated: 
 7.1 For the purposes of subsection 7B(2) of the Act, the objectives of this plan are: 

 
 (a) to conserve the stocks of prawns in the area of the fishery;
 (b) to reduce the fishing pressure on the stocks of prawns in the area of the fishery; and
 (c) to promote the economic efficiency of the fishery. 

 
 7.2 The measures for attaining the objectives specified in paragraph 7.1 shall include: 

 
 (a) the determination of the fishing capacity of the fishery;
 (b) the determination of the number of units of fishing capacity for the fishery available to a unit holder for allocation and assignment, which shall be renewable and transferable; and
 (c) the facilitation of the withdrawal of units and boats from the fishery.
 [Emphasis supplied.]

Gummow J, at 161, said that certain determinations by the Minister were said to be invalid "(a), because they were made ultra vires, and (b), because the determinations were unreasonable and irrational in the Wednesbury sense, or "disproportionate".

At 163, Gummow J said: 
 ... when the issue concerns not the exercise of discretion by the validity of delegated legislation, the question is ... whether there is a "real connection" between the delegated legislation and the purpose for which the Parliament conferred the authority to make the law under challenge.</text>

<tocase>Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minster for Natural Resources [2005] NSWCA 10</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2005/10.html</AustLII>
<text>A case not dissimilar in principle to the present was Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minister for Natural Resources [2005] NSWCA 10.

In that case, the Minister had made a Water Sharing Plan for the Lower Murrumbidgee Groundwater Sources 2003, which was a legislative instrument under the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW). The appellant, who was an association of primary producers, unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the Plan in the Land and Environment Court and appealed to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds, including one based on irrationality.

Spigelman CJ (with whom Beazley and Tobias JJA agreed) said, at [111]: 
 The Appellant's case on irrationality has its factual foundation in the limited interconnectivity within the aquifers the subject of the Plan. Although it is accepted that each aquifer is a single geological formation, it is submitted that the absence of interconnectivity is such that it is not rational to treat this formation as a single body of water for the purposes of a plan under the Act.

At [121], his Honour summarised the contentions by the appellant: 
 [Under this plan] the transferor will receive a windfall by obtaining consideration for an asset, being the entitlement which they may never have used and which in the future could not use. The transfer of entitlements provides no environmental benefit, it could never have been utilised, but the holder of the licence receives financial consideration (which may be quite substantial) from the transferee who can utilise the licence.

Continuing: 
 The effect is that the transferee suffers a financial detriment which is to the benefit of the transferor. In these circumstances, although there may be windfall gains and losses, there is no net benefit for the acquifer or the environment.
 ... 

 
 ... the absurdity of the Plan is emphasised by the fact that many of those who will acquire water will have expended considerable sums in developing their properties, in some cases with the active encouragement of the government, only to now pay money for water rights without which part of their capital investment in infrastructure may be lost.
 ... 

 
 ... the applicants submit that the consequences of the Plan is to give a windfall to some and inflict financial hardship on others.

And at [122]: 
 ... the limited degree of interconnectivity which is accepted by all experts leads to a level of unfairness that indicates irrationality or illogicality.

Where there is a challenge to the exercise of a statutory power on the basis of irrationality or unreasonableness, Spigelman CJ said, at [129]: 
 ... Perhaps the most appropriate formulation is whether the decision is "illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at [52] and [37], [173] ....</text>

<tocase>P W Adams v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1998) 49 ALD 68</tocase>
<text>Branson J observed in P W Adams v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1998) 49 ALD 68 , at 76-77: 
 Plainly, there is a difference between "maximising economic efficiency in the exploitation of fisheries resources" and maximising the economic efficiency of individual participants in the fishing industry. The objectives of the AFMA are objectives intended to be pursued in the public interest; they are not intended to require AFMA to pursue, assuming that it would be possible for it to do so, the separate interests of individual participants in the fishing industry. Of course, in many circumstances, the respective interests of individual participants in the fishing industry and the public interests which AFMA is required by its objectives to pursue in the performance of its functions will be consistent. In some circumstances they will not be consistent.</text>

<tocase>Secretary, Department of Primary Industries and Energy v Collins [1992] FCA 61 ; (1992) 34 FCR 340</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/61.html</AustLII>
<text>Heerey J in Secretary, Department of Primary Industries and Energy v Collins [1992] FCA 61 ; (1992) 34 FCR 340 was concerned with the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery Preliminary Management Plan, determined by the Minutes under s 7B of the Fisheries Act 1958 (Cth). His Honour said, at 345: 
 The starting point is the proposition that the Plan has the force of law.
 ... 

 
 Parliament clearly intended that a plan of management .... should create detailed rights and obligations in relation to a fishery ... The provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act concerning tabling before and disallowing by Parliament are to apply. 

 
 Thus a plan of management stands on quite a different legal footing from policy statements or guidelines. The Minister and the Secretary, like all other citizens, are bound by the law contained in a plan of management just as they are by the law in the Act itself.

It is now accepted that the Management Plan is a legislative instrument, and is amenable to challenge only under the Judiciary Act .

It was suggested that item 5 of the s 32 table of the Management Plan was not "reasonably appropriate and adapted to obtain the objectives" of maximising economic efficiency set out in s 3 of the FM Act.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/3.html</AustLII>
<text>Adapting the words of Gummow J, the question of validity in the present case is whether the determination of the Management Plan goes beyond what could reasonably be adopted for the purpose of allocating statutory fishing rights in the Fishery and promoting the economic efficiency of the Fishery, it not being enough that the Court itself might think that the Plan as amended inexpedient or misguided: see South Australia v Tanner [1989] HCA 3 ; (1989) 166 CLR 161 at 168.</text>

<tocase>Williams v Melbourne Corporation [1933] HCA 56 ; (1933) 49 CLR 142</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1933/56.html</AustLII>
<text>Spigelman CJ said, at [130]: 
 With respect to a power to make a plan of the character under consideration in the present case, I find particularly helpful the formulation of Sir Owen Dixon in Williams v Melbourne Corporation [1933] HCA 56 ; (1933) 49 CLR 142 at 155: 

 
To determine whether the bylaw is an exercise of a power, it is not always enough to ascertain the subject matter of the power and consider whether the bylaw appears on its face to relate to that subject. The true nature and purpose of the power must be determined and it must often be necessary to examine the operation of the bylaw in the local circumstances to which it is intended to apply. Notwithstanding that ex facie there seemed a sufficient connection between the subject of the power and that of the bylaw, the true character of the bylaw may then appear to be such that it could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power. In such a case the bylaw will be invalid, not because it is inexpedient or misguided, but because it is not a real exercise of the power.

Spigelman CJ adopted the words of Dixon J, as he then was, in Williams v Melbourne Corporation , which involved a power to regulate traffic. Dixon J said, at 156: 
 ... The ultimate question in the present case appears to me to be whether, when applied to the conditions of Melbourne, the bylaw involves such an actual suppression of the use of the streets for the purposes of the necessary transit of an important and ordinary commodity as to go beyond any restraint which could be reasonably adopted for the purpose of preserving the safety, convenience and proper facility of traffic in general.

Spigelman CJ made the important observation, at [139]: 
 It is always necessary to commence with the identification of the particular statutory power, understood in its context, and to assess the exercise of that power against the high standard of unreasonableness or of irrationality which the outcome must reach before the Court can legitimately infer that the legal limits to the exercise of the power have not been observed so that, to adopt the formulation from Williams v Melbourne Corporation quoted above, the Plan "could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power" and, therefore, "is not a real exercise of the power".

Spigelman CJ said, at [144]: 
 Inevitably, when significant changes are made to an established regulatory regimes, there will be winners and losers. Considerations of equity are quintessentially matters for political decision-making. I am not satisfied that anything in the nature, scope and purpose of the Act prevents the Minister from implementing a scheme which operates to the detriment of some persons and to the advantage of others, in a manner not determined by availability of water but by broader considerations of what the Minister regards as equitable.

And, at [152]: 
 ... What is fair or unfair in such a context is a matter on which reasonable minds can differ. In view of the conflicting interests involved, a broad brush approach of general application is not, in my opinion, irrational.</text>
