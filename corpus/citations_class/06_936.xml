<tocase>Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2000) 220 CLR 129</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/42.html</AustLII>
<text>90 The pecuniary penalties which the Act applies are punitive in nature. Their character is not adequately described by the rather anodyne term 'protective' Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [35] [37], [41] [43] and [99]. Consistently with the characterisation as punitive the object of the penalties is general and specific deterrence. That is the deterrence of those who might be tempted not to comply with the law and the deterrence of the particular contravenor who might be tempted to re-offend Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Donovan (1998) 28 ACSR 583 at 608 (Cooper J), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at 114 (Santow J).</text>

Their character is not adequately described by the rather anodyne term 'protective' Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [35] [37], [41] [43] and [99].

91 In Donovan Cooper J was concerned with the application of penalties under s 1317EA(3)(b). He said of the section that: 
 
 'Its purpose in an appropriate case is to punish, but principally imposition of a pecuniary penalty is to act as a personal deterrent and a deterrent to the general public against a repetition of like conduct.' 
 

The same approach was adopted by Santow J in Adler in which his Honour said (at [125]):
 
 
 'It is well established that the principal purpose of a pecuniary penalty is to act as a personal deterrent and a deterrent to the general public against a repetition of like conduct.'</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169</tocase>
<text>92 In the context of competition law in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 (at 174 [17]) Finkelstein J said: 
 
 'In antitrust cases retribution has no real role to play. Nor does rehabilitation, but for different reasons. Those who view retribution as an appropriate theory of punishment hold that the offender must be given some punishment because he "ought" to be punished: the "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" approach to criminality. The proponents of this view see some social satisfaction in a "just" punishment, perhaps because it can be regarded as repayment to society for the violation. It might also be justified as suppressing acts of private vengeance. However, society is moving away from using a punishment for retribution even in purely criminal cases and, to my mind, it has no role to play in relation to the punishment of a corporation. One difficulty is that if punishment is to be regarded as an exercise of morality, presumably there must be some relationship between the harm intended by the criminal act and the harm inflicted on the offender. But as there is no measurable relationship between the two types of harm, there is no reasonable basis for choosing a particular penalty. Rehabilitation is a concept that has no useful role to play regarding corporations for one cannot rehabilitate a legal fiction. So, if the purpose of antitrust laws is to define certain socially intolerable conduct, deterrence must be the means by which a corporation is to be hindered from engaging in that conduct.' 
 

The general approach thus outlined is also relevant to the imposition of penalties for breach of the Act particularly as in this case, breaches of provisions designed to maintain an informed market.

93 The deliberateness of a corporation's contravening act or omission may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the risk of that corporation reoffending. That is relevant to particular deterrence. When a corporation takes a calculated risk by intentionally or recklessly failing to disclose material information to the market, it may be inferred that there is a corporate culture which encourages or, at least, tolerates or permits decision-making which expressly or implicitly weighs the benefit of non-compliance against the risk if non-compliance is detected. For such deliberate conduct, the risk associated with re-offending must be set at a high level by high penalties. It is not necessary or useful to tread upon the shifting sands of moral denunciation in having regard to issues such as intention or recklessness in fixing penalty cf however, the helpful and comprehensive discussion of the issue, albeit with a different perspective, in the context of competition law penalties by Yeung K in Securing Compliance :A Principled Approach (Hart Publishing, 2004, at Chapter 4).

94 Where non-disclosure conduct amounts to fraud by the deliberate non-disclosure of information calculated to affect decision-making by potential investors or creditors, the Court should not hesitate, as an incident of its penalty fixing process, to identify the unacceptable character of such conduct. However the continuous disclosure obligation imposes a duty not limited to abstention from intentional breach, or the avoidance of recklessness or carelessness. Its possible contraventions will cover a wide range of conduct. In such a case it is preferable to find a common principle applicable to the full range of conduct by reference to considerations of deterrence rather than super-added qualitative considerations of uncertain provenance relating to the morality of the particular contravenor's actions.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (1999) 161 ALR 69</tocase>
<text>100 When a regulator brings action to enforce the provisions of a public statute and agreed orders and penalties are proposed, it is not the role of the Court merely to rubber stamp them. In this respect what I said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (1999) 161 ALR 79 is relevant in the present case (at 79]: 
 
 'As a general principle fair and appropriate settlements are encouraged to reduce the burden of litigation on both public and private resources. Courts are frequently asked to play their part by accepting formal undertakings or making orders by consent which prohibit parties from certain conduct or require them to do certain things. Sometimes they are asked to impose agreed pecuniary penalties. In carrying out those functions, courts are conscious of the public interest in the settlement of cases. They must also be conscious, however, that the laws they apply are public laws. It is in the public interest that, in considering agreements between parties requiring orders of the court, the court does not act as a mere rubber stamp. What is proposed must always be scrutinised to determine whether the undertakings or consent orders are within power and are appropriate.'</text>

<tocase>NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285</tocase>
<text>101 In relation to proposed pecuniary penalties, Burchett and Kiefel JJ said in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 (at 291):
 
 'There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.'

102 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 619 , Weinberg J referred to what he considered to be the 'somewhat undesirable practice on the part of the ACCC in presenting this Court with a specific figure as an 'agreed pecuniary penalty'' (at [32]). While acknowledging that both the ACCC and Colgate had accepted that the figure proposed was in no way binding upon the Court, his Honour could not find a single instance when the Court had not in the past endorsed such a figure. His Honour went on (at [34]): 
 
 'It is difficult to imagine that the parties would propose a pecuniary penalty that is so clearly beyond the permissible range that the Court will depart from it. As the authorities presently stand, the Court is bound to impose an agreed pecuniary penalty, save in such circumstances.' 
 

His Honour acknowledged the importance of the principles enunciated in NW Frozen Foods and, in particular, the need for corporations to have certainty of outcome if they were to be encouraged to engage in negotiated settlements. He was bound by those principles and the well-established line of authority to accept that the Court would not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure. His Honour said: 
 
 
 'However, there are dangers associated with this approach. The Court may be seen, perhaps not altogether incorrectly, to act as a 'rubber stamp' in simply approving a decision taken at an executive level by a body charged with investigating and prosecuting contraventions of the Act, but having no role in actually imposing particular sanctions for those contraventions. Negotiated settlements are an important vehicle for resolving complex matters such as those involving the present case. It must be borne in mind, however, that there is a public interest in ensuring that corporations that engage of behaviour of the kind that occurred in this case are dealt with appropriately, and that proper recognition is given to the need for specific and general deterrence. There are important parallels between the fixing of a pecuniary penalty under s 76 , and the ordinary sentencing process which is quintessentially a matter for the courts.' 
 

His Honour made clear that he was not critical of a joint submission between regulator and contravenor about what might be the appropriate range of pecuniary penalties to be imposed. A submission couched in those terms could assist in achieving a measure of certainty and consistency of treatment with other like cases.

103 I agree, with respect, with the remarks of Weinberg J. In the end, however, no 'agreed penalty' can bind the Court. Consistently with NW Frozen Foods the Court will apply a principle of judicial restraint in deciding whether or not to make orders in the terms proposed by the parties. But that principle of judicial restraint is not a self imposed constraint equating the role of the Court to one of judicial review of a sentencing discretion. Such a self imposed limitation could amount to an abdication of the duty that the Court has to exercise the jurisdiction which is invoked and the powers conferred upon it by the Parliament. NW Frozen Foods does not, in my opinion, confine the Court to the imposition of a penalty differing from the agreed penalty only where the agreed penalty would be outside the range of penalties which could be imposed in the proper exercise of a sentencing discretion. The restraint which is applied by the Court to regulatory settlements is informed by practical considerations which differ from the principles and criteria informing its judicial review function or the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in relation to discretionary judgments.</text>
