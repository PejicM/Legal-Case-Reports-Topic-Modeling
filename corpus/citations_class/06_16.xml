<text>8 In my view, the authorities support the proposition that, in considering whether removal is reasonably practicable, physical considerations, such as the health of the person to be removed are relevant. So much appears from NATB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 292 ; (2003) 133 FCR 506 at [52] ( NATB ), Li v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 181 at [7] and albeit in perhaps quite circumscribed circumstances in the judgment of WAJZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2004] FCA 1332 at [86] . Of course, I do not take into account any consequences which may be inflicted upon the applicant upon his return to Turkey in the light of the decision which has been made about his protection visa application. To do so would fly in the face of NATB and M38/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 131 ; (2003) 131 FCR 146. That itself introduces a somewhat difficult perspective in the present matter because, unlike other cases in which the health of the person being removed has been considered, the damage to the health of this applicant by the process of removal is related to his fears of what may happen to him if he were to return to Turkey. Such matters are more appropriately considered in final determination of the claim.</text>
