<text>I was satisfied on 6 March 2009 that, of course, in terms of the High Court's decision in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457 , that there was a prima facie case made out in the sense that there was a sufficient threshold of success in the proceeding made out taking account of the balance of convenience. One of the influences at the time, in terms of making the order, apart from being satisfied of the integers in O'Neill's case was that dates could be found on 19 and 20 March 2009 for the hearing of the matter which, as I say, largely involved questions of construction, although, no doubt, there would be some questions of factual controversy to be resolved which would require findings of fact. Nevertheless, the scope of the proceedings seem to be reasonably well contained.

On the hearing of the application, the respondents in proceeding QUD63 of 2009, as I said earlier, indicated that they may wish to commence their own proceedings. Those proceedings were in fact commenced on 11 March 2009. Directions orders were made for the orderly progression of both matters and, in particular, orders were made that the two proceedings would be heard together since they involved common issues and common factual questions, and that any question of pecuniary penalties to be determined in either proceeding on application by the relevant parties would be dealt with as a separate question.

What emerged, of course, was that with the filing of the statement of claim in the related matter (QUD66 of 2009), the matters raised by the applicant parties in that proceeding were a little more complex than had been thought and the filing and serving of affidavits was likely to be more detailed than was first thought. As a result, the matter was brought back for a Directions Hearing and further orders were made. The dates of 19 and 20 March 2009 for the hearing of the trial were vacated and dates of trial were identified and allocated for 23 and 24 April 2009.</text>
