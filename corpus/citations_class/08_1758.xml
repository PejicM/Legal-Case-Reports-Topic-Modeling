<tocase>Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd 2 [1971] NSWLR 278</tocase>
<text>50 In Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at 437-439 [659] - [666] , Tamberlin J admitted evidence of this kind in judicial review proceedings so that the Court was in the position to understand the particular meaning of words used in the specialised area concerned. He applied what Street J had earlier held in Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd 2 [1971] NSWLR 278 at 286 that an argumentative process between experts enables the Court to proceed more readily and thus appreciate the relevant issue for decision. It can also illuminate the application of a specialised usage of words in the context.</text>

<tocase>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223</tocase>
<text>105 I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR.

178 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 76 [73] McHugh and Gummow JJ said that one species of what is known as Wednesbury unreasonableness ( Wednesbury [1948] 1 KB at 230) was identified by Dixon CJ in Klein v Domus Pty Ltd [1963] HCA 54 ; (1963) 109 CLR 467 at 473. There, Dixon CJ said that if it appeared that the dominating or actuating reason for a decision was outside the scope of the purpose of the enactment, that vitiated the supposed exercise of a discretion. Dixon CJ said that the Court looks to the scope and purpose of a provision and what its real object is to determine whether a decision-maker has exercised a discretion in accordance with the purpose of the enactment. However, the Court must approach the exercise from the perspective that the real object of the legislature is to leave the scope for judicial or other officer who is investigating the facts and considering the purpose of the enactment to give effect to his or her view of the justice of the case: see too S20/2002 198 ALR at 75-76 [67]-[70]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 [30] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. A decision which is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith or so absurd that no sensible person could dream that it lay within the powers of the decision-maker is affected by jurisdictional error: Palme 216 CLR at 221 [30].</text>

<tocase>Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1951/5.html</AustLII>
<text>172 That reasoning dealt with what the Commission had provided in pars 10(f) and (g). But it avoided the real possibility that an inactive service with a soft dial tone might not be an ULLS service at all. Serviceability is one thing, existence another. As Fullagar J observed in Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 258:
 "A power to make laws with respect to lighthouses does not authorize the making of a law with respect to anything which is, in the opinion of the law-maker, a lighthouse. A power to make a proclamation carrying legal consequences with respect to a lighthouse is one thing: a power to make a similar proclamation with respect to anything which in the opinion of the Governor-General is a lighthouse is another thing."

173 In the way it was expressed, the Commission's final determination did not adapt the provisions of Code 569, because it presupposed the fundamental matter that an ULLS transfer request had to determine, namely, the existence of an ULLS to transfer. This created a fundamental uncertainty both as to how the final determination should be construed and the methodology for Telstra to follow postulated in par 10. If the presupposition is wrong in respect of a request made by Optus, will Telstra be in breach of the final determination since it can never supply the service over the identified pathway used by the soft dial tone? Alternatively, will Telstra be entitled to reject the request in any event because the omission of essential information in the ULLS transfer request process in cl 11 of Code 569 and or cl 13 of Guideline 587 (namely the ULLS identifier) entitled it to do so?

174 Neither scenario makes the final determination certain. The presupposition takes the place of the processes in cl 11 of Code 569 without establishing that the process in par 10(a) can be applied to a particular line with a soft dial which is not, in fact, an ULLS. And, notwithstanding that par 10(a) treats every request where a soft dial tone is present as an ULLS transfer request, if Telstra can reject each such request because it does not give an ULLS identifier, the process stipulated in the final determination is pointless.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1707.html</AustLII>
<text>48 In my opinion, some of the contentious material was admissible to prove the meaning of technical terms used in the final determination, Code 569 and Guideline 587 (discussed below at Ch 7) in the context of the telecommunications industry: Collector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398-399 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. Evidence as to the meaning of technical terms used in an administrative decision is admissible so that the Court is placed in the context of understanding the natural and ordinary meaning of those words as they would be understood by persons familiar with their use: see also Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at 566 [458] . Such evidence is capable of establishing that the decision-maker erred in its understanding of the technical matters with which its decision dealt. In Australian Retailers Association 148 FCR at 566 [458], Weinberg J held that such evidence is admissible where an administrative decision is challenged on the ground that the decision-maker lacked jurisdiction to make it because that was dependent on an actual state of facts that did not exist, or the decision-maker based the decision on a finding of a particular fact that did not exist. He said:
 "If additional evidence is available, in cases reliant upon such grounds, there is no reason in principle why such evidence should not also be admissible where the ground is couched in terms of unreasonableness."

106 A decision-maker must give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case: Khan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1987] FCA 457 ; (1987) 14 ALD 291 at 292 per Gummow J; Zhang v Canterbury City Council (2001) 51 NSWLR 589 at 601 [62] where Spigelman CJ collected the authorities; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 [138] per Kirby J; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at 92-93 [212] per Madgwick J, 96 [229] per Conti J; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , [60] where I applied this principle. In Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462C-D, Black CJ said that where a decision-maker was required to consider material, the process of consideration "... involves an active intellectual process" directed at the nominated subject-matter: see too per Burchett J at 476F-477E, per Kiefel J at 495F-G and Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277G per Finn J; Australian Retailers Association 148 FCR at 577 [526] per Weinberg J.</text>

<text>164 Optus argued that the proper construction of par 10(a) required an assumption that the requirements of cl 11.4 of Code 569 were satisfied once the conditions set out in par 10(a) were met. In other words Optus argued that the final determination required Telstra to treat the provision of the information specified in par 10(a) by itself, as an ULLS transfer request with the necessary consequence that Telstra would then process it as if it were valid under cl 11.5 of Code 569. It contended that the final determination should be construed in a practical manner which required "... Telstra to modify its existing procedures to exclude the kind of validation processes that are specific to transfers between access seekers". It referred to the practical approach in construction of instruments enunciated by Lord Reid in Gill v Donald Humberstone &amp; Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 929 at 933-934 and applied by Stone J in Australian Tea Tree Oil Research Institute v Industry Research and Development Board [2002] FCA 1127 ; (2002) 124 FCR 316 at 328-329 [37] - [38] ; see too per Stein and Giles JJA in Langton v Independent Commission against Corruption (2000) 49 NSWLR 164 at 167-168 [12]-[13]. Lord Reid had said that instruments which were addressed to practical people skilled in a particular trade or industry ought be construed in light of practical considerations rather than by a meticulous comparison of the language of their various provisions of the kind appropriate for the construction of a statute.</text>

<text>180 In Avon Downs Pty Limited v Commissioner for Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 Dixon J discussed judicial review of an administrative decision for which the decision-maker did not have to give reasons. He said:
 "The conclusion he has reached may, on a full consideration of the material that was before him, be found to be capable of explanation only on the ground of some such misconception. If the result appears to be unreasonable on the supposition that he addressed himself to the right question, correctly applied the rules of law and took into account all the relevant considerations and no irrelevant considerations, then it may be a proper inference that it is a false supposition. It is not necessary that you should be sure of the precise particular in which he has gone wrong. It is enough that you can see that in some way he must have failed in the discharge of his exact function according to law."</text>

<text>191 I am of opinion that par 10(e) could be severed because the rest of the final determination would not operate differently without it: Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1 at 371 per Dixon J; Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Act Case) [1996] HCA 56 ; (1996) 187 CLR 416 at 502 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The relevance of par 10(e) is that it confirms the incorrect approach which the Commission took as to the significance of a soft dial tone in par 10(a). Severance of par 10(e) would not make the final determination any more meaningful or give it validity.</text>

<text>160 Optus argued that par 10 of the final determination had to be construed in accordance with the principle explained by Dixon J in King Gee Clothing Company Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 at 195 and Cann's Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210 at 227-228. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Westfield Management Limited v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [2007] HCA Trans 367 applied that principle to hold that where it was asserted that one of its terms was uncertain, an instrument or decision made under a statute was not construed as if it were a contract: cp Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437.</text>

<text>48 In my opinion, some of the contentious material was admissible to prove the meaning of technical terms used in the final determination, Code 569 and Guideline 587 (discussed below at Ch 7) in the context of the telecommunications industry: Collector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398-399 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. Evidence as to the meaning of technical terms used in an administrative decision is admissible so that the Court is placed in the context of understanding the natural and ordinary meaning of those words as they would be understood by persons familiar with their use: see also Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at 566 [458] .

<tocase>Eastern Trust Co v McKenzie, Mann &amp; Co [1915] AC 750</tocase>
<text>41 This reflects a fundamental precept of constitutional law. When legislative power is used to create rights or impose liabilities and obligations, one consequence is that the freedom of those affected by the legislation is constrained or expanded by what the law provides. Where the law requires the executive branch of government, such as the Commission, to do something to give effect to the intention of the Parliament, the executive must obey the law, just like every other member of the community, be it a corporation or individual. This is because it is the duty of the executive branch of government to obey the law as laid down by the Parliament and the Courts, even if the executive does not agree with those decisions: The Commonwealth v New South Wales [1923] HCA 23 ; (1923) 32 CLR 200 at 214 per Isaacs, Rich and Starke JJ applying Eastern Trust Co v McKenzie, Mann &amp; Co [1915] AC 750 at 759; see also Tran v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1229 ; (2006) 154 FCR 536 at 540 [9] per myself.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/22.html</AustLII>
<text>138 I am of opinion that while the Commission had taken the provisions of Code 569 and Guideline 587 into account (Reasons [202]), it did not treat Code 569 as providing model terms and conditions covering the ULLS for the purposes of s 152AQB(9). This was because it did not consider that the October 2003 determination included, relevantly, the whole of cl 11 of Code 569 as model terms and conditions. That was a misconstruction or misunderstanding of the purposes of Code 569 and its October 2003 determination in the sense that the Commission did not have regard the whole of to cl 11 as being a determination under s 152AQB(9) but rather had regard to it as a provision of lesser importance. This resulted in the Commission failing to exercise its powers in accordance with s 152AQB(9): cf: Minister for Immigration v Gray [1994] FCA 1052 ; (1994) 50 FCR 189 at 208B-D per French and Drummond JJ; Elliott v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCAFC 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 559 at 572 [40] - [42] per Ryan, Tamberlin and Middleton JJ. The weight which the Commission accorded Code 569, and in particular cl 11, may have been different and more significant had it had regard to the Code in accordance with s 152AQB(9).</text>

In that case, the Court held that evidence was admissible in judicial review proceedings to assist in the determination of a jurisdictional fact, namely, whether a development fell within a statutory description "special industry": see Enfield 199 CLR at 147 [24], 155-156 [50].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/38.html</AustLII>
<text>108 Because s 152CR(1) required it to take into account each of the seven specified factors, the Commission had to give each of them appropriate consideration in arriving at its final determination. The number and variety of factors which a statute requires a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to in arriving at a decision necessarily affects the weight any one of those factors must be given in the deliberative process. In Sean Investments [1979] HCA 32 ; 180 CLR 322 , the costs were fundamental - or foundational - because they were the only matter which the statute prescribed. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the statutory power provide a context in which to assess the duties it imposes on the decision-maker in any particular situation: cf: Foster v Minister for Customs [2000] HCA 38 ; (2000) 200 CLR 442 at 452 [22] - [23] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreeing with their Honours at 454 [32].

112 Therefore, depending on the facts of a particular arbitration, one or more of the matters in s 152CR(1) may become of greater or lesser weight in the decision-making process. However, as a matter of law, none of the factors, including s 152CR(1)(d), is entitled to a fixed weighting in that process regardless of the subject matter of any arbitration and all other relevant factors: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 41 per Mason J; Foster 200 CLR at 452 [22]-[24] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; cf: Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [118] per Lindgren J.</text>

The ULLS service was a core service described in the Act. The Act provided specifically for the regulation of access to that service. It imposed liabilities on Telstra, among others, to ensure that access was given in accordance with the model terms and conditions (if they were applicable) that the Parliament required be promulgated by the Commission acting with an appropriate degree of urgency and attention to the terms of the Act. The explanatory memorandum was not the law and its stated intention was not reflected in the statutory language.

<tocase>Gill v Donald Humberstone &amp; Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 929</tocase>
<text>164 Optus argued that the proper construction of par 10(a) required an assumption that the requirements of cl 11.4 of Code 569 were satisfied once the conditions set out in par 10(a) were met. In other words Optus argued that the final determination required Telstra to treat the provision of the information specified in par 10(a) by itself, as an ULLS transfer request with the necessary consequence that Telstra would then process it as if it were valid under cl 11.5 of Code 569. It contended that the final determination should be construed in a practical manner which required "... Telstra to modify its existing procedures to exclude the kind of validation processes that are specific to transfers between access seekers". It referred to the practical approach in construction of instruments enunciated by Lord Reid in Gill v Donald Humberstone &amp; Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 929 at 933-934 and applied by Stone J in Australian Tea Tree Oil Research Institute v Industry Research and Development Board [2002] FCA 1127 ; (2002) 124 FCR 316 at 328-329 [37] - [38] ; see too per Stein and Giles JJA in Langton v Independent Commission against Corruption (2000) 49 NSWLR 164 at 167-168 [12]-[13]. Lord Reid had said that instruments which were addressed to practical people skilled in a particular trade or industry ought be construed in light of practical considerations rather than by a meticulous comparison of the language of their various provisions of the kind appropriate for the construction of a statute.

187 Optus argued that the Commission should not be taken to have required the parties to engage in a pointless exercise of submitting a Vacant ULLS request in circumstances where it was already known that they should be rejected. It pointed to the necessity to construe the words of par 10(e) in a way that gave them a practical operation consistent with the intention of the Commission: Gill [1963] 1 WLR at 933-934 per Lord Reid.

188 Optus argued that the Commission was concerned to specify a practical means of identifying and connecting a particular line to a customer's premises. It said that that par 10(e) read together with par 10(a) showed that the existence of a soft dial tone indicated an existing continuous connection on a particular line from the customer's apartment with an MDU to the exchange. It contended that the practical utility of this was to enable Telstra, when provided with the other information in par 10(a), to identify the particular line in place and allow for connecting (jumpering) Optus' equipment to occur at the exchange without the need for technicians to visit the apartment building to connect a different pair of copper wires to the customer's premises. Optus argued that par 10(e) applied to situations other than those in par 10(a), namely that there was no soft dial tone so that it was not possible to identify an existing continuous connection.

189 While these submissions of Optus recognised the practical operation of the final determination, they pointed to the fact that it did not operate on an ULLS connection, but rather in respect of a presupposed situation where there either was an ULLS (par 10(a)) or there was no ULLS (par 10(e)). That was the very difficulty of which Telstra complained. The drafting of par 10 was inapt to specify terms and conditions for ordering and provisioning a communications wire or ULLS in a practical or intelligible fashion. The Commission's power was conferred to enable it to regulate a declared service, such as the ULLS, not to regulate something else. The Commission's powers under Part XIC of the Act to determine access to the declared service, being the ULLS, did not extend to determining matters where no ULLS existed as contemplated in par 10(e). I am of opinion that the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by including par 10(e) in its final determination.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/32.html</AustLII>
<text>159 Telstra argued that par 10 fails to specify terms and conditions with reasonable precision or in such a way that both Telstra and the Court can determine whether a particular request by Optus must be dealt with in a certain, identified way: cf: Herald-Sun TV Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1985] HCA 32 ; (1985) 156 CLR 1 at 4 per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ. Telstra contended that par 10 was "... so vaguely expressed that either its meaning or its application is a matter of real uncertainty ..." and so was not "... reasonably certain", using the words of Kitto J in Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 70. Kitto J said there that the latter concept included both certainty of expression and certainty in operation.</text>

<tocase>King Gee Clothing Company Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/23.html</AustLII>
<text>160 Optus argued that par 10 of the final determination had to be construed in accordance with the principle explained by Dixon J in King Gee Clothing Company Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 at 195 and Cann's Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210 at 227-228. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Westfield Management Limited v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [2007] HCA Trans 367 applied that principle to hold that where it was asserted that one of its terms was uncertain, an instrument or decision made under a statute was not construed as if it were a contract: cp Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437.

161 Dixon J said that uncertainty as a test of validity arises from the nature of the power: King Gee 71 CLR at 195-196. He distinguished between ambiguities and uncertainties bound to arise from forms of expression and intricacies of subject matter on the one hand, which could be resolved by construing and interpreting the instrument (here final determination). Dixon J pointed out that, on the other hand, when what is described in the instrument, however clearly, involves a matter which is not an ascertainable fact or figure but a matter of estimate, assessment, discretionary allocation or apportionment resulting in the attribution of an amount or figure as a matter of judgment, then no certain objective standard is prescribed and the power has not been exercised in accordance with the statute: King Gee 71 CLR at 197; see also Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50 ; (1979) 142 CLR 460 at 480-481 per Gibbs J with whom Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ agreed.</text>

<tocase>Langton v Independent Commission against Corruption (2000) 49 NSWLR 164</tocase>
<text>164 Optus argued that the proper construction of par 10(a) required an assumption that the requirements of cl 11.4 of Code 569 were satisfied once the conditions set out in par 10(a) were met. In other words Optus argued that the final determination required Telstra to treat the provision of the information specified in par 10(a) by itself, as an ULLS transfer request with the necessary consequence that Telstra would then process it as if it were valid under cl 11.5 of Code 569. It contended that the final determination should be construed in a practical manner which required "... Telstra to modify its existing procedures to exclude the kind of validation processes that are specific to transfers between access seekers". It referred to the practical approach in construction of instruments enunciated by Lord Reid in Gill v Donald Humberstone &amp; Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 929 at 933-934 and applied by Stone J in Australian Tea Tree Oil Research Institute v Industry Research and Development Board [2002] FCA 1127 ; (2002) 124 FCR 316 at 328-329 [37] - [38] ; see too per Stein and Giles JJA in Langton v Independent Commission against Corruption (2000) 49 NSWLR 164 at 167-168 [12]-[13]. Lord Reid had said that instruments which were addressed to practical people skilled in a particular trade or industry ought be construed in light of practical considerations rather than by a meticulous comparison of the language of their various provisions of the kind appropriate for the construction of a statute.</text>

<text>105 I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR.</text>

119 Section 152CP(5) required the Commission to give its reasons for making the final determination. And pursuant to s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , that obligation extended to setting out its findings on material questions of fact including references to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. Those requirements focus on the subjective thought processes of the decision-maker. It must set out its findings on those questions of fact which it considers to be material to the decision it has made and the reasons it had for reaching that decision as explained by McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR at 346 [68].

120 The purpose of the arbitration was to determine whether Optus should be granted access to the ULLS in a manner different to its then current access. The subject matter, scope and purpose of ss 152CP(2) and 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination about the subject matter of the arbitration concerning access by Optus to the declared ULLS service to have regard to the actual direct costs which Telstra would incur in providing the access to Optus as required by the final determination.

121 The Commission accepted that there were already direct costs incurred by Telstra in providing the existing access. But, the Commission, as decision-maker, had to have regard in addition to the direct cost to Telstra of effecting what it was considering as a final determination. This view is reinforced by the prohibition imposed by s 152CQ(1)(f). That directs the Commission not to make a final determination for access if in doing so Telstra would be required to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of extending or enhancing the capability of a facility. Thus, not only was the Commission required to have regard to Telstra's actual direct costs for the purposes of arriving at a final determination, it was prohibited, if the costs of doing so were unreasonable, from making a final determination.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1994/1052.html</AustLII>
<text>138 I am of opinion that while the Commission had taken the provisions of Code 569 and Guideline 587 into account (Reasons [202]), it did not treat Code 569 as providing model terms and conditions covering the ULLS for the purposes of s 152AQB(9). This was because it did not consider that the October 2003 determination included, relevantly, the whole of cl 11 of Code 569 as model terms and conditions. That was a misconstruction or misunderstanding of the purposes of Code 569 and its October 2003 determination in the sense that the Commission did not have regard the whole of to cl 11 as being a determination under s 152AQB(9) but rather had regard to it as a provision of lesser importance. This resulted in the Commission failing to exercise its powers in accordance with s 152AQB(9): cf: Minister for Immigration v Gray [1994] FCA 1052 ; (1994) 50 FCR 189 at 208B-D per French and Drummond JJ; Elliott v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCAFC 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 559 at 572 [40] - [42] per Ryan, Tamberlin and Middleton JJ. The weight which the Commission accorded Code 569, and in particular cl 11, may have been different and more significant had it had regard to the Code in accordance with s 152AQB(9).</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/29.html</AustLII>
<text>122 In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69] McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said that the primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute.

123 I am of opinion that the requirement in s 152CR(1)(d) that the Commission take into account the direct costs of providing access to the declared service in making a final determination must be read consistently with its obligation to refrain from making such a determination if, in doing so, a party would be required to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of extending or enhancing the capability of a facility.

124 The Commission did not set out any findings as to the direct costs of Telstra providing access to the ULLS either generally (see Reasons at [118]) or specifically those which would be incurred by Telstra in providing the service required in the final determination. The Act required the Commission to have regard to those costs by giving them proper, genuine and realistic consideration in arriving at its final determination. A mere recitation of submissions to it and then the expression of an unreasoned conclusion, could not suffice to comply with the Commission's obligation, within the meaning of s 152CR(1)(d), to have regard to Telstra's direct costs of providing access and its claim that they would be about $1.7 million. It did not have regard to Telstra's direct costs of providing the access it required under its final determination.

175 For these reasons, I am of opinion that the final determination was uncertain both in expression and in operation. It was therefore unlawfully made: Project Blue Sky Inc (1998) 194 CLR at 393 [99]-[101].

176 Telstra also argued that the final determination was unreasonable in the sense provided in s 5(2)(g) of the ADJR Act , namely an exercise of power that was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could so exercise the power, and that therefore, there had been an improper exercise of power ( ADJR Act , s 5(1)(e)). Telstra argued that the final determination was illogical in the sense that it did not depend upon the Commission's evaluation of evidence or the drawing of factual inferences. It also contended that the final determination was illogical because it required the parties to the arbitration to comply with rules that were inconsistent internally with one another. This, in essence, was another way of arguing the same issues as have been discussed above.

177 Optus argued that Telstra understood the practical implications of the proposed determination communicated by the Commission during the arbitration as indicating that it was not illogical. It contended that the result of the final determination was a reasonable outcome in the circumstances.</text>

<text>40 Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ observed in Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane [1987] HCA 12 ; (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518 that the words of a Minister must not be substituted for the text of the law, particularly when the intention stated by the Minister was unexpressed in a law restrictive of the liberty of an individual. I am of opinion that this canon of construction also applies in circumstances where the text of the law imposes responsibilities and liabilities on persons, including corporations, who contravene it. Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ continued:
 "It is always possible that through oversight or inadvertence the clear intention of the Parliament fails to be translated into the text of the law. However unfortunate it may be when that happens, the task of the Court remains clear. The function of the Court is to give effect to the will of Parliament as expressed in the law."</text>

There, Dixon CJ said that if it appeared that the dominating or actuating reason for a decision was outside the scope of the purpose of the enactment, that vitiated the supposed exercise of a discretion. Dixon CJ said that the Court looks to the scope and purpose of a provision and what its real object is to determine whether a decision-maker has exercised a discretion in accordance with the purpose of the enactment. However, the Court must approach the exercise from the perspective that the real object of the legislature is to leave the scope for judicial or other officer who is investigating the facts and considering the purpose of the enactment to give effect to his or her view of the justice of the case: see too S20/2002 198 ALR at 75-76 [67]-[70]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 [30] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. A decision which is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith or so absurd that no sensible person could dream that it lay within the powers of the decision-maker is affected by jurisdictional error: Palme 216 CLR at 221 [30].

183 As McHugh and Gummow JJ identified in S20/2002 198 ALR at 76 [73] the principle in Melbourne Stevedoring 88 CLR at 120 does not depend upon unreasonableness but upon the absence of a factual basis in which the power could be exercised. For the reasons that I have given above, in reality, the Commission was not satisfied of the requisite matters upon which its power to make the final determination depended, namely, it acted on the misconception that the presence of a soft dial tone demonstrated the existence of an unconditioned communications wire or ULLS. This was because of its misunderstandings of the subject matter with which it purported to deal, that I have described. The Commission's determination was therefore unreasonable and an improper exercise of power.</text>

<text>125 Whether the Commission used $360,000 as Telstra's costs or not, it gave no reasons for its finding that Telstra's costs would be negligible. The Commission either made a mistake about what Optus submitted or it had no reasons for rejecting Telstra's estimate of $1.7 million. Optus' submission that the Commission had not used the $360,000 as Telstra's costs recognised at least implicitly, that such a use would be a failure by the Commission to have regard to Telstra's direct costs under s 152CR(1)(d). While I think that it is likely that the Commission was confused about Optus' estimate of $360,000 as being an estimate of Telstra's costs, it is not possible to decide one way or the other whether it did because of the Commission's lack of reasons on this matter: Palme 216 CLR at 223-224 [39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ.

126 I am of opinion that the deficiencies in the Commission's reasons which I have just discussed show that it had no reasons for rejecting Telstra's estimate of $1.7 million and that it did not comply with the requirement of s 152CR(1)(d).

127 Telstra argued that the Commission's approach to Code 569 was reviewable under s 5 of the ADJR Act . It contended that the Commission had:
 
&#8226; failed to observe the procedures required by s 152AQB(9) (s 5(1)(b) of the ADJR Act );
 
&#8226; improperly exercised its power in making the final determination because it had failed to take into account a relevant consideration (s 5(1)(e) and (2)(b) of the ADJR Act ).

178 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 76 [73] McHugh and Gummow JJ said that one species of what is known as Wednesbury unreasonableness ( Wednesbury [1948] 1 KB at 230) was identified by Dixon CJ in Klein v Domus Pty Ltd [1963] HCA 54 ; (1963) 109 CLR 467 at 473. There, Dixon CJ said that if it appeared that the dominating or actuating reason for a decision was outside the scope of the purpose of the enactment, that vitiated the supposed exercise of a discretion. Dixon CJ said that the Court looks to the scope and purpose of a provision and what its real object is to determine whether a decision-maker has exercised a discretion in accordance with the purpose of the enactment. However, the Court must approach the exercise from the perspective that the real object of the legislature is to leave the scope for judicial or other officer who is investigating the facts and considering the purpose of the enactment to give effect to his or her view of the justice of the case: see too S20/2002 198 ALR at 75-76 [67]-[70]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 [30] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. A decision which is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith or so absurd that no sensible person could dream that it lay within the powers of the decision-maker is affected by jurisdictional error: Palme 216 CLR at 221 [30].

182 In Palme 216 CLR at 223-224 [39], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to this principle. They distinguished it from a situation where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, when the Court may be able to infer that he had no good reason (cf: per Gibbs CJ in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/32.html</AustLII>
<text>103 In Reg v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322 at 329, Mason J, with whom Gibbs J agreed at 324, explained the significance of a statutory requirement that a decision-maker "have regard to" costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in a particular nursing home when determining a scale of fees. Mason J said that the expression "have regard to" required the decision-maker to take the costs into account and give them weight "... as a fundamental element in making his determination": Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329. He explained that in that case there were two reasons for such a construction, first, that the costs were the only matter explicitly mentioned as a matter to be taken into account and, secondly, the scheme of the provisions was that once an approval were given, the proprietor of the nursing home was not permitted to exceed the scale of fees fixed by the decision-maker.

104 As Mason J pointed out the section did not require the decision-maker there to fix the scale of fees exclusively by reference to particular costs. The decision-maker was entitled to have regard, he said, to other relevant considerations. But, the function of the decision-maker was to determine a scale of fees for the particular nursing home, not all nursing homes. Thus the Act directed that regard be had to the costs incurred in providing care in that nursing home: Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329.

105 I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR.

108 Because s 152CR(1) required it to take into account each of the seven specified factors, the Commission had to give each of them appropriate consideration in arriving at its final determination. The number and variety of factors which a statute requires a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to in arriving at a decision necessarily affects the weight any one of those factors must be given in the deliberative process. In Sean Investments [1979] HCA 32 ; 180 CLR 322 , the costs were fundamental - or foundational - because they were the only matter which the statute prescribed. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the statutory power provide a context in which to assess the duties it imposes on the decision-maker in any particular situation: cf: Foster v Minister for Customs [2000] HCA 38 ; (2000) 200 CLR 442 at 452 [22] - [23] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreeing with their Honours at 454 [32].</text>

<tocase>Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1963/30.html</AustLII>
<text>159 Telstra argued that par 10 fails to specify terms and conditions with reasonable precision or in such a way that both Telstra and the Court can determine whether a particular request by Optus must be dealt with in a certain, identified way: cf: Herald-Sun TV Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1985] HCA 32 ; (1985) 156 CLR 1 at 4 per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ. Telstra contended that par 10 was "... so vaguely expressed that either its meaning or its application is a matter of real uncertainty ..." and so was not "... reasonably certain", using the words of Kitto J in Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 70. Kitto J said there that the latter concept included both certainty of expression and certainty in operation.

167 I am of opinion that par 10 is uncertain for the reason given by Kitto J in Television Corporation 109 CLR at 71 when he said of conditions imposed in a licence by a Minister purportedly under a statutory power to do so:
 "After all, the power given to the Minister is to prescribe the conditions of his own authority to deprive a licensee of its licence. Is it really to be supposed that the Parliament intended that he might prescribe conditions in words of such dubious import that no one but himself would be sure how far he meant them to go? The Parliament did not give the Minister power to suspend or revoke licences at will. The course it took was to require him to describe in advance, by the formal method of imposing conditions upon a licence, what conduct of the licensee would expose the licence to suspension or revocation. I can see no justification for so loose an interpretation of the Act that a form of words which by reason of vagueness fails to perform that function may be held a condition within the intended scope of the authority."

168 The provisions of par 10 of the final determination must be read as a whole. This is because the whole of par 10 purports to specify what Telstra must do to order and provision so as to provide access. Thus, in pars 10(a) and (e), the Commission equated the presence of a soft dial tone as the signification that an ULLS exists that provides the connection over which the soft dial tone is transmitted. For the reasons that I have given, that is fallacious. And because it is fallacious, but fundamental to the requirement for Telstra under par 10(a) to treat the request as a valid ULLS transfer request, if Optus' construction is correct, I am of opinion that the final determination is uncertain and unworkable.

169 This view is reinforced by consideration of par 10(f) and (g). These deal with the situation where Optus has submitted an ULLS transfer request that meets the requirements in par 10(a). In the first case, Optus must accept any risk as to quality of connection "... on the existing copper path between the Telstra exchange and the end-user premises" (emphasis added). Again, this demonstrates the Commission presupposed that in every case the presence of a soft dial tone identified the existence of a copper path. What is Telstra to do if that assumption is, as it can be, incorrect? It cannot supply the service the subject of the request as an ULLS service because, even though the soft dial tone is transmitted by the path that exists, that path is not an ULLS path. And, if Optus and the Commission are correct, Telstra cannot reject the transfer request but must treat it as valid even though it does not relate to an ULLS. That is, the final determination commits Telstra to processing as an ULLS transfer request, a request based on no more than the existence of a soft dial tone and the provision of a telephone number to Optus' new subscriber's address.</text>

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1436.html</AustLII>
<text>109 Here, s 152CR(1) prescribes a number of matters for consideration. This is a sure legislative indication that these matters must be central matters for the Commission. But, because s 152CR(2) expressly widens the range of matters which the Commission may consider, it is authorised to arrive at a final determination, after due consideration, which accords more weight to some other factor or factors than those in s 152CR(1). Indeed, the factors in s 152CR(1) itself tend in different directions. The interests of a carrier (s 152CR(1)(b)) and those of all persons who have a right to use a declared service (s 152CR(1)(c)) more often than not will be opposed. If the Commission were to give fundamental weight to each in the sense which Telstra argued, how could it arrive at a decision favouring one at the expense of the other? cf Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 at [311] - [312] per Lindgren J.

111 In Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [122] Lindgren J held that s 152CR(1)(a) is the factor which should be given fundamental weight, namely, whether the determination will promote the long-term interests of end-users of services supplied by means of carriage services. This was because, he held, that factor reflected the sole object of Part XIC of the Act as expressed in s 152AB(1): see Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [17] . Of course, s 152AB(2)(e) supplements this concept by identifying an objective of encouraging the economically efficient use of, and economically efficient investment in, the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied. Often that objective may not be attained if an infrastructure investment is not economically feasible for the service provider to make or support. So, by dint of s 152AB(2)(e) the interests of end-users may well include that the service provider is not forced to act in a way which for it is economically unjustifiable. Possibly, a monopolist may be able to be forced to lower prices or make way for competition under s 152AB(2)(e), but not to run the business as a charitable exercise or at a loss.

112 Therefore, depending on the facts of a particular arbitration, one or more of the matters in s 152CR(1) may become of greater or lesser weight in the decision-making process. However, as a matter of law, none of the factors, including s 152CR(1)(d), is entitled to a fixed weighting in that process regardless of the subject matter of any arbitration and all other relevant factors: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 41 per Mason J; Foster 200 CLR at 452 [22]-[24] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; cf: Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [118] per Lindgren J.</text>

<text>2 Many MDUs have a main distribution frame ("MDF"). The MDF is used to connect the telephony wires of dwellings within the MDU to appropriate wires that, in turn, connect to a telephone exchange. A form of connection is by use of a copper or aluminium wire, which, as explained below, is defined as a "communications wire". One, but by no means the exclusive, means of connection between the exchange side of the MDF and the exchange itself is through an unconditioned communications wire. This form of communication is called an unconditioned local loop service ("ULLS"). Telstra Corporation Limited owns and maintains those local loops. It also owns over 5,000 local exchanges as explained in Telstra Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [2008] HCA 7 ; (2008) 243 ALR 1 at 3-4 [1] - [8] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

3 The essential and defining characteristics of the ULLS are that it consists of an unconditioned communications wire (usually a twisted pair of copper or aluminium wires) between, in substance, the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange itself. However, there are other means of connecting between the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange, including using fibre optic cable. Thus, the mere fact that there may be wires physically present at the exchange side of the MDU does not mean that the whole path to the exchange from that wire will always be physically along a copper or aluminium communications wire or wires.

4 Other telecommunications providers than Telstra are able to offer telephony services to, among others, residents of MDUs. In September 2006, Optus Networks Pty Limited was such a provider. At that time, Optus notified a dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission concerning access to the ULLS provided by Telstra in MDUs under s 152CM(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Part XIC of the Act regulates, among other things, access to parts of the PSTN, and requires the Commission to act as an arbitrator of disputes between participants in the telecommunications industry concerning access to services.</text>

<text>41 This reflects a fundamental precept of constitutional law. When legislative power is used to create rights or impose liabilities and obligations, one consequence is that the freedom of those affected by the legislation is constrained or expanded by what the law provides. Where the law requires the executive branch of government, such as the Commission, to do something to give effect to the intention of the Parliament, the executive must obey the law, just like every other member of the community, be it a corporation or individual. This is because it is the duty of the executive branch of government to obey the law as laid down by the Parliament and the Courts, even if the executive does not agree with those decisions: The Commonwealth v New South Wales [1923] HCA 23 ; (1923) 32 CLR 200 at 214 per Isaacs, Rich and Starke JJ applying Eastern Trust Co v McKenzie, Mann &amp; Co [1915] AC 750 at 759; see also Tran v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1229 ; (2006) 154 FCR 536 at 540 [9] per myself.</text>

<text>181 Inadequacy of the material relied on by the administrative decision-maker, while not itself being a ground for prohibition is a circumstance which may support, in a case like the present, the inference that the Commission was applying the wrong test or was not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters: The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Limited [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120. There, Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ referred to the important distinction between a mere insufficiency of evidence or other materials to support a conclusion of fact when the function of finding the fact has been committed to a person or body by the Parliament and, on the other hand, the absence of any foundation in fact for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which, in point of law, the existence of the power depends. They said that it was not enough if the repository of the power, properly interpreting the section of the Act under which it was conferred and applying the correct test: 
 "... nevertheless satisfies itself or himself on inadequate material that facts exist which in truth would fulfil the conditions which one or other or both of those paragraphs prescribe. The inadequacy of the material is not in itself a ground for prohibition. But it is a circumstance which may support the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters. If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact."

183 As McHugh and Gummow JJ identified in S20/2002 198 ALR at 76 [73] the principle in Melbourne Stevedoring 88 CLR at 120 does not depend upon unreasonableness but upon the absence of a factual basis in which the power could be exercised. For the reasons that I have given above, in reality, the Commission was not satisfied of the requisite matters upon which its power to make the final determination depended, namely, it acted on the misconception that the presence of a soft dial tone demonstrated the existence of an unconditioned communications wire or ULLS. This was because of its misunderstandings of the subject matter with which it purported to deal, that I have described. The Commission's determination was therefore unreasonable and an improper exercise of power.</text>

Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable".

110 I am of opinion that the sense in which the High Court used the expression "fundamental weight" in this context is to require the decision-maker to treat the consideration of the factors, as opposed to the factors themselves, as a central element in the deliberative process: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338 per Mason J. In this way the decision-maker will give appropriate weight to those factors. The Parliament sought to ensure that the Commission would give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to each of the factors it specified in s 152CR(1) but without confining it to those matters, as s 152CR(2) showed. Such consideration must be reflected in the Commission's reasons for its decision.</text>

<tocase>Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Act Case) [1996] HCA 56 ; (1996) 187 CLR 416</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/56.html</AustLII>
<text>191 I am of opinion that par 10(e) could be severed because the rest of the final determination would not operate differently without it: Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1 at 371 per Dixon J; Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Act Case) [1996] HCA 56 ; (1996) 187 CLR 416 at 502 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The relevance of par 10(e) is that it confirms the incorrect approach which the Commission took as to the significance of a soft dial tone in par 10(a). Severance of par 10(e) would not make the final determination any more meaningful or give it validity.</text>

<tocase>Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/977.html</AustLII>
<text>50 In Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at 437-439 [659] - [666] , Tamberlin J admitted evidence of this kind in judicial review proceedings so that the Court was in the position to understand the particular meaning of words used in the specialised area concerned. He applied what Street J had earlier held in Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd 2 [1971] NSWLR 278 at 286 that an argumentative process between experts enables the Court to proceed more readily and thus appreciate the relevant issue for decision. It can also illuminate the application of a specialised usage of words in the context.</text>

<tocase>Westfield Management Limited v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [2007] HCA Trans 367</tocase>
<text>160 Optus argued that par 10 of the final determination had to be construed in accordance with the principle explained by Dixon J in King Gee Clothing Company Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 at 195 and Cann's Pty Limited v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210 at 227-228. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Westfield Management Limited v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [2007] HCA Trans 367 applied that principle to hold that where it was asserted that one of its terms was uncertain, an instrument or decision made under a statute was not construed as if it were a contract: cp Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437.</text>

<tocase>Zhang v Canterbury City Council (2001) 51 NSWLR 589</tocase>
<text>106 A decision-maker must give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case: Khan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1987] FCA 457 ; (1987) 14 ALD 291 at 292 per Gummow J; Zhang v Canterbury City Council (2001) 51 NSWLR 589 at 601 [62] where Spigelman CJ collected the authorities; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 [138] per Kirby J; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at 92-93 [212] per Madgwick J, 96 [229] per Conti J; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , [60] where I applied this principle. In Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462C-D, Black CJ said that where a decision-maker was required to consider material, the process of consideration "... involves an active intellectual process" directed at the nominated subject-matter: see too per Burchett J at 476F-477E, per Kiefel J at 495F-G and Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277G per Finn J; Australian Retailers Association 148 FCR at 577 [526] per Weinberg J.</text>
