<text>1 On 19 October 2006 the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, acting personally, decided to cancel Chaouki Nassif's visa pursuant to s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Mr Nassif has applied for an order quashing the decision of the Minister. By his amended application, Mr Nassif claims that the Minister failed to warn him that she did not intend to treat the best interests of a child, namely Joshua Young, as a primary consideration in making the decision, and additionally failed to consider whether she was required to treat Joshua's best interests as a primary consideration (see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273). Joshua, who at the time of the Minister's decision was 12 years old, is the son of Mr Nassif's fianc&eacute;e, Ms Sharon Young.

2 It is uncontentious that the Minister did not advise Mr Nassif that it was not her intention to treat the best interests of Joshua as a primary consideration in making her decision. It is also uncontentious that she did not treat the best interests of Joshua as a primary consideration in making her decision.

3 The parties agree that in the circumstances of this case the Minister was only obliged to treat the best interests of Joshua as a primary consideration if Mr Nassif had a "parental or other close relationship" with Joshua. The phrase "parental or other close relationship" comes from Ministerial General Direction No 21. The parties also agree that the information before the Minister was such as to require her to turn her mind to whether Mr Nassif had such a relationship with Joshua.

4 The only issue to be determined is thus whether it is appropriate for the Court to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that the Minister did not give consideration to whether the relationship between the Mr Nassif and Joshua was a "parental or other close relationship". For the reasons set out below I am of the view that it is appropriate for the Court to so conclude.

5 The Minister signed a statement of reasons in respect of her decision. The statement records that, after concluding that she was empowered by s 501(2) of the Act to cancel Mr Nassif's visa, the Minister turned to consider whether to exercise her discretion to do so.</text>
