<text>2 The appeal is being heard by me as a single judge pursuant to s 25 (1AA)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). An appeal to this Court from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of re-hearing, but the process remains a process for the correction of error. As Kenny J said in Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 [4]:
 
 'On an appeal by way of re-hearing, the powers of an appellate court are exercisable only if the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to the evidence before the appellate court, the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error'.

3 Therefore, the burden rests on the appellant to demonstrate some legal, factual or discretionary error by the Federal Magistrate. In turn, the Federal Magistrate was examining the question whether there was jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.

4 The Tribunal examined each of the grounds upon which the appellant challenged the decision of the delegate, and rejected all of the grounds raised by the appellant. The Tribunal concluded that there was 'an overwhelming lack of credibility' in the appellant's claims regarding his political profile and activities and alleged fear of persecution for political reasons. The Tribunal formed the view that he had 'fabricated a colourful set of claims' to support his application for a protection visa.</text>

<text>6 The Tribunal's findings on credibility were central to its decision. A finding on credibility that was open to the Tribunal on the material before it does not give rise to an error of law: see Mashayekhi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 321 ; (2000) 97 FCR 381 and W148/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703. Findings on credibility were described by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 as the function of the primary decision-maker, par excellence: at 423 [67]. That does not mean that such findings are invulnerable to review, but it does mean that they will not ordinarily be reviewable if the Tribunal has provided a rational basis for rejecting the claims and relied upon matters that were logically probative of the issues it was determining: see Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 552 and 559.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/22.html</AustLII>
<text>8 The notice of appeal alleged a number of jurisdictional errors. First, it was contended that the Tribunal erred in adopting an unduly harsh approach to the requirement that there be a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, and more particularly, that the Tribunal did not apply the 'real chance' test enunciated in cases such as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 and Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379 (' Chan' ). Those cases require both a subjective apprehension of persecution and an apprehension that is grounded in objective reality. This has been described as a 'real chance' of persecution, namely, a chance that is not remote or insubstantial or a far-fetched possibility: see Chan at 389, 398, 407 and 429. Secondly, the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal made errors in its assessment of 'serious harm' as embodied in s 91R(1)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Thirdly, the notice of appeal contended that the Tribunal erred by basing its findings on country information concerning the Naxalite movement, rather than on information provided by the appellant. The fourth ground of appeal was that the Tribunal misdirected itself by failing to correctly identify the appellant's social and political group, which was described as a non-violent segment of the Naxalite movement. Finally, the notice of appeal raised a contention that the Tribunal was biased. This contention appears to be largely premised upon the way in which the Tribunal questioned the appellant and then proceeded to reach conclusions as to his credibility.</text>
