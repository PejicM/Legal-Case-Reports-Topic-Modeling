<tocase>Re Application of Vouris and Anor (2004) 49 ACSR 543; [2004] NSWSC 384</tocase>

<text>The first is the fact that the order is sought to be made prospectively, that is, a replacement in anticipation of a pending resignation. Counsel has referred me to several authorities which provide clear authority for reading the relevant section in that way, namely, Re Application of Vouris and Anor (2004) 49 ACSR 543; [2004] NSWSC 384 ; Re Wily and Anor (2003) 49 ACSR 94; [2003] NSWSC 1260 and Re McGrath and Anor (as liqs of HIH Insurance Ltd) (in liq) (2005) 54 ACSR 55; [2005] NSWSC 506. I am satisfied that there is power to make the order sought and there being power, it is clearly convenient to do so, subject to the other aspect.

My concern in a nutshell is that the suspension of a liquidator may not achieve very much if the firm of which he is a member continues in practice, to do the work. My concern, however, is alleviated very considerably because counsel is able to point out that in the matters of both Vouris and Wily , to which I have referred, experienced corporations judges in the Supreme Court, Palmer J and Barrett J, have each permitted the replacement of one liquidator by another in very similar circumstances. Whilst there is no real discussion in those decisions of the point that troubles me, I am certain that it would not have escaped the attention of either of those judges. The fact that they made the respective appointments in question is an indication that in situations like this, because of the practical consequences, the judges have been prepared to rely upon the professional responsibility of the replacement liquidator. I am, therefore, in sound company in so doing.</text>
