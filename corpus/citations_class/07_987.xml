<text>15 It is said on behalf of Mr Temple that these are proceedings for declarations of contraventions of the WR Act and the BCII Act and the imposition of pecuniary penalties. They are civil not criminal and the civil rules of evidence and procedure apply, albeit there is a need for "exactness of truth": Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362-363 applied by Austen J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vines (2003) 21 ACLC 159.</text>

<tocase>A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 226 ALR 247</tocase>
<text>16 It is submitted for Mr Temple that the respondents' case as pleaded simply puts him to proof. He says there is no privilege against self-incrimination or exposure to a penalty available to either the CFMEU or the CFMEUW. Having regard to the pleading, he is entitled to proceed on the basis that no respondent seeks to propound a positive defence not just that "no positive defence is currently advanced" as the respondents say in their joint submissions. Reliance is placed upon the observations of Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 226 ALR 247 at [17]. When the respondents suggest for the first time in their written submissions that there are "very live issues of credit [as to which] the applicant's case will succeed or fail" the applicant submits that it is hard to place much weight on such a statement in view of the absence of even a positive denial of a single fact pleaded against any respondent.

17 There is no doubt that the Court may permit the evidence-in-chief of a witness in civil proceedings to be given by that witness orally swearing to, or affirming, the truth of a statement previously made. It is immaterial whether the statement previously made was by way of a witness statement or the transcript of answers given to questions put in the course of an oral examination whether under some compulsory process or not. It follows that a witness may by way of affidavit swear to or affirm the truth of a previous statement exhibited to the affidavit or to the truth of a transcript of a previous interview so exhibited. The affidavit may be read in evidence provided that the witness is available, if required, for cross examination.</text>

<tocase>Platcher v Joseph [2004] FCAFC 68</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/68.html</AustLII>
<text>18 In Platcher v Joseph [2004] FCAFC 68 , Tamberlin and Emmett JJ accepted at [101] that when an affidavit of a witness affirmed the truth and accuracy of a transcript of evidence given in an examination under s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), the transcript of that interview was "potentially admissible". Weinberg J said (at [163]):
 
 The approach of calling a witness to adopt a previous statement as true and correct is routinely followed in this Court. Indeed, that approach is expressly contemplated by s 37(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which allows a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence in chief of its maker, pursuant to rules of court.

21 Buchanan J referred to s 37 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and in particular s 37(3) which contemplates the exercise by a court of power in the rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence-in-chief of its maker. A question arose whether the statements adopted by the witnesses were hearsay within the meaning of s 59 of the Evidence Act . His Honour held that if they were they would fall within an exception to the hearsay rule in s 63 and not be inadmissible for that reason. He referred to the decision of the Full Court in Platcher v Jones [2004] FCAFC 68. He did not read the observations of their Honours as turning on the requirements of s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act . I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations. His Honour rejected the objection taken to the admissibility of the statements. He also rejected a separate submission that the Court should require the evidence to be given orally in any event. He saw no reason to depart from earlier directions that the conduct of the proceedings be by affidavit. His Honour said (at [4 ]):
 
 In the circumstances, I will admit the statements in question in the sense that I will not exclude them from the evidence upon the basis which has so far been argued. However, it follows that if the statements are to be treated as part of the evidence in chief, as I think they should be, then they will be subject to objections in the ordinary way upon some other foundation if that appears to be available. Such objections will need to be dealt with as they are taken. I reject the objection so far taken in a general way to the statements in question.</text>

<tocase>Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/833.html</AustLII>
<text>19 Recently, a question very similar to that which arises in this case, arose before Buchanan J in an application for civil penalties by an Australian Building and Construction Commission inspector: Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833. As part of an investigation into alleged breaches of the WR Act statements were taken from a number of people. They were signed and witnessed. The Commission subsequently sought to rely upon affidavits sworn or affirmed by people from whom the statements were taken in which they deposed to the truth and accuracy of the statements and exhibited them to the affidavits. Eight statements adopted in that fashion were relied upon at the hearing before Buchanan J as part of evidence-in-chief in the applicant's case.

20 Buchanan J ruled that the witness statements were made admissible by their adoption in the affidavits. Although his ruling was made in the course of the hearing, his Honour subsequently reduced his reasons for decision to writing.

21 Buchanan J referred to s 37 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and in particular s 37(3) which contemplates the exercise by a court of power in the rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence-in-chief of its maker. A question arose whether the statements adopted by the witnesses were hearsay within the meaning of s 59 of the Evidence Act .
