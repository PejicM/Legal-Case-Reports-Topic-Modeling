<text>In Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, the Court said: 
 Nor is there any serious dispute between the parties that appellate courts exercise particular caution in reviewing decisions pertaining to practice and procedure. Counsel for Brown urged that specific cumulative bars operate to guide appellate courts in the discharge of that task. Not only must there be error of principle, but the decision appealed from must work a substantial injustice to one of the parties. The opposing view is that such criteria are to be expressed disjunctively. Cases can be cited in support of both views: for example, on the one hand, Niemann v. Electronic Industries Ltd. [1978] V.R. 431 , at p. 440; on the other hand, De Mestre v. A.D. Hunter Pty. Ltd. (1952) 77 W.N. (N.S.W.) 143 , at p. 146. For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria. The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various. We would merely repeat, with approval, the oft-cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in In re the Will of F.B. Gilbert (dec.) (1946) 46 S.R. (N.S.W.) 318 , at p. 323: 

 
"... I am of opinion that, ... there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal."
 
 
 See also, Brambles Holdings Ltd. v. Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 80 ; (1979) 40 F.L.R. 364 , at p. 365; 28 A.L.R. 191 , at p. 193; Dougherty v. Chandler (1946) 46 S.R. (N.S.W.) 370 , at p. 374. It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration.

The proceeding is listed for hearing on 27 March 2009. The Federal Magistrates Court has now advised that the applicant can appear by video should this Court entertain the applicant's application and appeal.

It does not seem that there was any good reason to reject the applicant's application to transfer the proceeding to the Victorian Registry. The proceeding had only recently been commenced. Because of the provisions of s 477 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) the applicant could not delay the commencement until she moved to Victoria.</text>

<tocase>House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The first respondent also submitted that the Court should not grant leave to appeal without identifying an error of the type described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5 or find that the exercise of the discretion by the Federal Magistrate had miscarried.

The first respondent indicated, however, that if the Court were of the opinion that an extension of time should be granted and leave to appeal be given, then the first respondent would consent to an order for transfer of the proceeding.

I think, with respect, that the Minister was right to adopt the attitude to which I have referred which, in my opinion, was entirely reasonable.

In House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: 
 The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.</text>
