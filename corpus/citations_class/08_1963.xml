<tocase>Jenkins v Enterprise Goldmines NL (1992) 6 ACSR 539</tocase>
<text>28 In Jenkins v Enterprise Goldmines NL (1992) 6 ACSR 539 at 550, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia said:
 In our opinion the application of the test involves a question of fairness. It is for the court to decide whether in balancing the interests of the company as a whole against minority interests the directors have acted so as to unfairly prejudice the interests of the minority. The court decides this "according to ordinary standards of reasonableness and fair dealing". Whether the conduct is unfairly discriminatory will be judged on standards which reasonable directors with such skills as directors should have, acting bona fide, would think to be fair.

29 In Jenkins 6 ACSR 539 , the Court held that once the Court is satisfied that there has been oppression or unfairness within the meaning of s 232 "it is the obligation of the Court to grant whatever relief is best suited to deal with that conduct": p 561. The Court said at 562:
 There is nothing in any of the authorities, however, which would tend to place a limit on the grant by the court of an appropriate remedy once it is found that the conduct complained of is oppressive, unfairly prejudicial, or unfairly discriminatory. The powers given to the court are extremely wide. They include the power to make orders regulating the conduct of the affairs of the company in the future. This necessarily involves the court making orders which may interfere with the internal administration of the company. There is nothing in the language of s 320 which suggests that the court should be reluctant to interfere where that is necessary or desirable to give effective relief. There is express power to order the appointment of a receiver and manager.

30 In my respectful opinion, the Court's comments are consistent with the wide powers given to the Court by s 233 and the scheme of s 233 which gives an unfettered discretion to the Court to fashion the appropriate remedy for the particular circumstances proved at trial.

31 The plaintiffs' case is that the defendant, by reason of the conflict which its directors have as shareholders and directors of NBBC, has acted oppressively or unfairly to the members. If the plaintiffs succeed, then they will be entitled to argue for any of the relief which is available under s 233. The relief which will be granted will be determined by reference to the circumstances of the case and will be fashioned so as to ensure that the defendant does not act in such a way as to be unfair to any of its members.</text>

<tocase>Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1401.html</AustLII>
<text>35 In Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , French J said (at [19], [20] and [21]):
 The question which has to be answered in an application for judgment under s 31A is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting or defending "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. That question is not to be answered by a finding that a party's statement of claim or defence fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence. A pleading may be rectified by amendment so as to raise a reasonable cause of action or defence. It follows that a finding that a pleading should be struck out under O 20 does not mean there must be judgment against the party whose pleading it is. There may yet, by amendment, be a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending that proceeding. In order to secure judgment under s 31A it must be shown that the party prosecuting or defending the proceeding has no reasonable prospect of success. This judgment can be made, by reference to pleadings, where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured. Alternatively, it may be a judgment made by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s 31A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established. ... Section 31A is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient. Section 31A allows for "judgment" or nothing. Alternative remedies with respect to deficient pleadings must be found in the rules of Court. ...

36 In my opinion, what the defendant here seeks to do is to strike out part of the pleading because as it is contended no court could give the relief which is sought, notwithstanding that s 233 of the Corporations Act allows for such relief. That is not an application under s 31A because it would not give rise to a judgment for the whole or part of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/511.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , Lindgren J said (at [50]):
 Section 31A of the FCA Act, like O 20 of the Rules, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form. Section 31A(1) is comparable to O 20, r 1 in that they are both concerned with summary judgment for the party who is prosecuting the proceeding. Section 31A(2) is comparable to O 20, r 2 in that they are both concerned with dismissals of proceedings. The word "judgment" in s 31A(2) is defined in s 4 of the FCA Act to mean "a judgment, decree or order, whether final or interlocutory, or a sentence". It is convenient in the context of the present case to think of the judgment to which s 31A(2) refers as an order of dismissal of a proceeding.

38 It is wrong to attempt to use s 31A for something for which it was not designed. It was not designed for the purpose of striking out an application or pleading or any part of a pleading for some defect in the application or pleading. It was designed to enable the Court to give judgment in respect of a proceeding or part of a proceeding when that proceeding or that part of the proceeding has no reasonable prospect of success. It is designed to deal with issues whether it be by way of a cause of action or an issue within a cause of action. It is not designed to attack the adequacy or the sufficiency of a pleading.

39 If any of the prayers for relief were struck out as sought, the Court would not thereby be giving judgment in favour of the defendant for the proceeding or part of the proceeding. The Court could not on the defendant's application give judgment on any part of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Re William Brooks &amp; Co Ltd [1962] NSWLR 142</tocase>
<text>58 The defendant submitted that the winding up of a publicly listed company in the absence of insolvency even for oppression is virtually unheard of, citing, so it was contended, the last reported case Re William Brooks &amp; Co Ltd [1962] NSWLR 142 where a winding up order was set aside by consent in the High Court.</text>

<tocase>Re Weedmans Ltd (1974) Qd R 377</tocase>
<text>59 I think that contention is incorrect. In Re Weedmans Ltd (1974) Qd R 377 the company was listed on the Brisbane Stock Exchange: p 382. The trial judge (Lucas J) found that the directors of the company had acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole. He found that they had failed "to observe the requisite standard of commercial morality" and their conduct "reacted unfairly and unjustly against other members": p 398. He ordered the company to be wound up as "it seems to me that no other remedy is available to them": p 399.</text>

<tocase>Latimer Holdings Ltd v SEA Holdings NZ Ltd [2005] 2 NZLR 328</tocase>
<text>60 The defendant relied upon a decision of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in Latimer Holdings Ltd v SEA Holdings NZ Ltd [2005] 2 NZLR 328 in which the Court of Appeal upheld a decision of a trial judge to enter summary judgment against plaintiffs in an application for oppression.

61 However, I do not think that that case supports the defendant's contention. It was argued in that case that the equivalent to s 232 and s 233 of the Corporations Act , s 174 of the Companies Act (NZ) , did not apply to a publicly listed company. However, the Court said (at [113]):
 The operative words of the provision express a general principle which is directed to "an unjust detriment to the interests of a member of the company" (Thomas at p693). That test is an objective one. The provision may be prayed in aid even if the conduct accords with the company's constitution, because even then inappropriate prejudice may still arise. Relief can be given even if the conduct complained of does not involve a want of good faith or a lack of probity. The fact that all members are treated uniformly as members will not necessarily make conduct fair. The reasonable expectations of members are distinctly relevant though this factor is not in and of itself necessarily determinative and those expectations are not necessarily restricted to purely "internal", or "formal" expectations. There are no fixed categories of cases to which s 174 apply. The provision is one of general application. Relief may be sought even with respect to a listed company.

62 In the circumstances of that case, however, the Court agreed with the trial judge that it was appropriate for him to have entered summary judgment.

63 I do not think that s 233(1)(a) is not available as a remedy because the defendant is a publicly listed company. I agree, with respect, that there is nothing in s 233 or the Corporations Act which suggests that s 233(1)(a) has no application to a publicly listed company.</text>

<tocase>Cumberland Holdings Ltd v Washington H Soul Pattinson &amp; Company Ltd (1977) 2 ACLR 307</tocase>
<text>64 I would accept, however, that it would be a rare circumstance where an order of that kind would be made and even rarer where the company is shown to be solvent. In the absence of a strong case and a clear need for the relief, the Court would not take the extreme step of winding up a solvent company: Cumberland Holdings Ltd v Washington H Soul Pattinson &amp; Company Ltd (1977) 2 ACLR 307.

65 Now is not the time to enquire into the financial health of the defendant or to determine whether it is solvent. It is not alleged by the plaintiffs that the defendant is insolvent. It is not in the plaintiffs' interests to make such a case.

66 The following matters can be noted. First, the defendant's financial statements have been prepared upon the basis that the defendant is a going concern. Secondly, the defendant's auditor's opinion is unqualified. Thirdly, the defendant, being a publicly listed company on the ASX, has reporting requirements which would include an obligation to advise the ASX of any changes in its financial circumstances.</text>
