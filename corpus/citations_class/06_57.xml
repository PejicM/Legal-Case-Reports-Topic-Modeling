<text>6 The approach of North J in VBAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965 is apt. In circumstances where the Tribunal's decision is based on alternative reasons and grounds, relief would not issue. It is unnecessary to deal with an additional argument put by the Minister that even if relief would otherwise issue the Court should not grant it, as a matter of discretion.
