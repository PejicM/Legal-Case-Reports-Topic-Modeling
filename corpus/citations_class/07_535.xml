<text>I have been referred to the decision of Hodgson J in George Ward Steel Pty Ltd v Kizkot Pty Ltd (1989) 15 ACLR 464; (1989) 7 ACLC 838, an authority I have myself applied in other cases, including Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Fairchild Development Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 714. Hodgson J's points are not, of course, a statutory formula but they are a useful checklist of things to at least take into account. Because of the very short time involved here, the indication of solvency is a fairly low threshold that is well met by the evidence which has been put before me.</text>
