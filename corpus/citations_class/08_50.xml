<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/AATA/2003/114.html</AustLII>
<text>11 The issue as to Mr Hill's eligibility for an invalidity service pension has previously been addressed by the AAT: Hill v Repatriation Commission [2003] AATA 114. It had affirmed the decision of the Repatriation Commission to reject that claim. The Court found legal error in that decision: Hill v Repatriation Commission (2004) 39 AAR 103, and on appeal: Repatriation Commission v Hill [2005] FCAFC 7 ; (2005) 142 FCR 88, so the claim was remitted to the AAT for reconsideration. On 31 October 2006 the AAT again affirmed the decision that Mr Hill was not entitled to an invalidity service pension under the Act: Hill v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 925. It did so because it was not satisfied that he was permanently incapacitated for work in accordance with a determination under s 37AA of the Act.</text>

<text>42 The contention of Mr Hill, in essence that the conclusion of the AAT was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached it, can also be expressed as saying that the evidence accepted by the AAT could not as a matter of law support a conclusion that Mr Hill is permanently able to work for periods adding up to more than eight hours per week. See Collector of Customs (Tas) v Flinders Island Community Association (1985) 7 FCR 205. If the evidence can reasonably support the AAT's conclusion, then there is no error of law: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7; Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12 ; (2001) 202 CLR 439. I have put the proposition in the affirmative notwithstanding the words of cl 5(2)(b) of the Determination because the AAT made a positive finding to that effect in [29] of its reasons.</text>

<text>45 The process of reasoning of the AAT is transparent. It made a factual decision on this aspect of the claim in the light of all the evidence. It has identified in its reasons the evidence upon which it made that decision. True it is that the AAT has not then minutely dissected that evidence to explain which particular parts of it attracted its general factual conclusions. But it has made findings on the material questions of fact (see per McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407), and its reasons for those findings are exposed sufficiently to enable the Court (and the parties) to understand how it reached those findings and so to discern if they were reached through legal error (see Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (1989) 18 ALD 224; Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115). In my view, no error of law by failing to comply with s 43 of the AAT Act has been made out in respect of the decision of the AAT concerning the invalidity service pension claim; see generally Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647.</text>

<tocase>Benjamin v Repatriation Commission (2001) 34 AAR 270</tocase>
<text>53 The AAT proceeded on the basis that by reason of s 120(4) the first task was to be reasonably satisfied that the applicant suffered from the conditions he asserted. It expressed that task as being that "matters of diagnosis are to be determined on the balance of probabilities", relying upon Benjamin v Repatriation Commission (2001) 70 ALD 622 at [54]-[55] per Moore, Emmett and Allsop JJ. Neither that decision, nor the Full Court decisions of Repatriation Commission v Budworth [2001] FCA 1421 ; (2001) 116 FCR 200 or Repatriation Commission v Cooke (1998) 90 FCR 307 on the issue which preceded it, used the expression "on the balance of probabilities" as a substitute for the statutory expression "to its reasonable satisfaction", although in Cooke 90 FCR 307 at 313, reference is made to the "civil standard of proof". In substance, there may be no difference between the two expressions of the legal test for diagnosis of injury. As nothing was made of the difference in submissions, it is not necessary to explore that matter. As noted, applying that test, the AAT concluded that Mr Hill suffered from alcohol dependence, depressive disorder and pathological gambling, but not from PTSD.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1988) 83 FCR 82</tocase>
<text>56 In Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1988) 83 FCR 82, the Full Court (Beaumont Hill and O'Connor JJ) at 97-98 set out the four steps required of the AAT in circumstances such as the present. They are commonly called now the Deledio steps. The first required it to determine whether upon all the material, it pointed to a hypothesis connecting Hill's alcohol dependence with the circumstances of his operational service. That step having been answered affirmatively, the second step was to determine if there was an applicable SOP in force. There was: Alcohol Dependence or Alcohol Abuse SOP (Instrument 76 of 1998) (the AD SOP). The third step was to determine whether the hypothesis fitted the "template" in the AD SOP, that is whether it was consistent with it. The fourth step then was to apply s 120(1), and as the AAT recognised, it is only at the fourth step that it was required to find facts from the material before it.

57 There were two hypotheses put forward on behalf of Mr Hill which were said to fit the AD SOP. One was that he had a psychiatric disorder, namely alcohol intoxication, while serving in Vietnam which was the precursor to his alcohol dependence or which was the precursor to the clinical worsening of his alcohol dependence. Clauses 4 and 5 of the AD SOP provide:
 
 
 Factors that must be related to service 
 
 4. Subject to clause 6, at least one of the factors set out in clause 5 must be related to any relevant service rendered by the person. 
 
 
 
 Factors 
 
 
 
 5. The factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse or death from alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse with the circumstances of a person's relevant service are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time of the clinical worsening of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical worsening of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) inability to obtain appropriate clinical management for alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The term "psychiatric disorder" is defined in cl 8 of the AD SOP as meaning "any Axis 1 or 2 disorder of mental health attracting a diagnosis under DSM IV".

58 
 
The AAT, after reviewing the medical and other evidence, said that it pointed to hypotheses either that Mr Hill had the condition of alcohol intoxication prior to the clinical onset or the clinical worsening of alcohol dependence. As the AAT considered alcohol intoxication to be a psychiatric disorder, the hypothesis met either cl 5(a) or cl 5(c) of the AD SOP.

104 In Mines v Repatriation Commission (2004) 86 ALD 62, Gray J after referring to the Full Court decisions I mentioned in [44] above said at 74, [48]:
 
 It is therefore clear that the question whether a veteran is suffering, or has suffered, a claimed injury or disease must be determined to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision-maker, that is, on the balance of probabilities. That question is not to be determined by asking whether there is a reasonable hypothesis that the veteran is suffering, or has suffered, the injury or disease and asking whether the material establishes that the facts supporting that hypothesis do not exist beyond reasonable doubt. If the question is posed as whether a veteran has suffered PTSD as a result of a traumatic event said to have occurred during the veteran's operational service, it must be answered by saying that the decision-maker must be reasonably satisfied that the traumatic event occurred before reaching the conclusion that the veteran suffered PTSD. Only if such a conclusion is reached does the reasonable hypothesis process of reasoning, outlined in the four steps referred to in Deledio , come into operation.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>73 There was differing medical evidence, in particular from Dr Parker and from Professor Goldney, as to the time during his operational service when Mr Hill first had the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. There was also and significantly differing medical evidence from them on two other topics. The first was whether Mr Hill ever had the psychiatric disorder of alcohol intoxication or whether he was simply intoxicated from time to time and then his alcohol dependence further led to or exposed his subsequent intoxication from time to time. The second was whether (if Mr Hill did suffer from alcohol intoxication as a psychiatric disorder) his psychiatric disorder of alcohol intoxication only followed his alcohol dependence. That evidence and the lay evidence touching on it was carefully considered by the AAT. It concluded, in terms of s 120(3), that the hypothesis that Mr Hill was suffering from the psychiatric disorder of alcohol intoxication in Vietnam before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence was a reasonable one. In the context of the issues it was considering, I think that conclusion clearly represents a finding as to the hypothesis that his psychiatric disorder arose in Vietnam before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence and continued to exist to and at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. That was the principal issue of medical contention. It is consistent with that reading of the AAT's reasons that it described Dr Parker's evidence, upon which it found that hypothesis was reasonable and as fitting the AD SOP template, as saying that "alcohol intoxication pre-dated or co-existed with alcohol dependence". In my view, the contrary contention requires an over-zealous reading of the AAT's reasons: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287.</text>

<tocase>Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/47.html</AustLII>
<text>79 Notwithstanding the characteristics of the material referred to by the Repatriation Commission, I was left with the firm view that Dr Parker (whose evidence on this topic was accepted) considered that alcohol intoxication preceded, and continued to exist to, the time when Mr Hill had the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. As the AAT said, it did not need to prefer his evidence to reach that view, so long as it was rational and available to support the hypothesis: see the comments of Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ in Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 414-415. The fact that both alcohol intoxication and alcohol dependence arose after Mr Hill commenced his operational service was clearly consistent with his and other's evidence about his alcohol consumption before that time, although it noted one drinking episode before that time which (the AAT said) fitted with the diagnostic description of alcohol intoxication. The AAT made the observation that it was implicit in the evidence of both specialists (Dr Parker and Professor Goldney) that Mr Hill's pattern of alcohol consumption in Vietnam represented deterioration or worsening of a psychiatric condition. Having considered the evidence of Dr parker, as the AAT's preferred witness on this topic, that is a fair observation. The AAT also had the evidence of Professor Varghese that alcohol dependence usually develops gradually. Dr Parker's evidence was described in the AAT's reasons as saying that
 
 "... the behaviour exhibited by Mr Hill was that of a diagnosable condition of alcohol intoxication, which condition at some stage later, but still while he was in Vietnam, developed into dependency."
 

It did so in the light of his cross-examination. That reliably reflects his evidence. He was speculative as to the precise dates of onset of each of those conditions, but not as to the fact of their onset or as to their sequence. His evidence supports the critical issue the existence of alcohol intoxication at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. That was material upon which the AAT could have reached its conclusion that a reasonable hypothesis had been raised by reason of either cl 5(a) or cl 5(c) of the AD SOP being met, i.e. that one of the alternative minimum factors specified for the existence of a reasonable hypothesis connecting Mr Hill's alcohol dependence with his operational service.

87 One variation of this submission was to start with the observation of Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ in Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 414-415 that it will be rare that a hypothesis, based on the raised facts, is unreasonable when it is put forward by a medical practitioner with appropriate expertise. The AAT was not unmindful of that statement. It referred to it elsewhere in its reasons. But the AAT did not regard the "raised facts" as supporting the hypothesis first suggested by Dr Parker, and as it explained upon all the evidence, Dr Parker's initial view came to be qualified. It was left with material upon which it did not regard the hypotheses put forward by Mr Hill as reasonable. In my view, it did not somehow misapply the law which, earlier in its reasons, it had correctly identified as applicable. In particular, it did not commit the error discerned in Repatriation Commission v Whetton (1991) 31 FCR 513 of reversing the question posed by s 120(3) to the positive existence of a reasonable hypothesis. That case, upon which counsel for Mr Hill relied, was quite different factually: the uncontroverted evidence in that case was that during service the deceased serviceman had been substantially exposed to material which could have led to the disease from which he did; the evidence in this matter in relation to pathological gambling did not go anywhere near so far.

107 I do not think that the decisions referred to by counsel for Mr Hill in this context dictate a contrary conclusion. Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; 175 CLR 408 concerned the process by which a diagnosed disease might be connected to service. It proceeded on the basis of the claimant having suffered essential hypertension. So the question of "diagnosis" (to use the AAT's word) was not in issue. So too in Byrnes v Repatriation Commission (1993) 177 CLR 465. The claimant's condition of cervical and thoracic spondylosis was not in issue. What was in issue was its relationship to his service, in that case in the Royal Australian Navy between 1942 and 1945.</text>

<text>84 Counsel for Mr Hill did not contend that the AAT had misdirected itself in law. It correctly said that a hypothesis must be reasonable, that is more than a mere possibility or not fanciful, and it must be consistent with the known facts: East v Repatriation Commission (1987) 16 FCR 517; Bull v Repatriation Commission (2001) 188 ALR 756.</text>

<tocase>Willcocks v Comcare (2001) 66 ALD 119</tocase>
<text>85 In my view, the AAT's conclusion that, on the evidence as a whole, the hypothesis connecting Mr Hill's pathological gambling with his operational service was "speculative", based on "some very general research", was open to it. So too was its conclusion that the hypothesis was not pointed to by the facts. Its factual conclusions, so long as they were reasonably open to the AAT, do not expose error of law even though other decision-makers may have reached a different conclusion: see e.g. Willcocks v Comcare (2001) 66 ALD 119.

86 Some of the alternative grounds of cross-appeal on this issue are in reality merely alternative ways of putting the same argument. They can be shortly dealt with. The AAT is not shown to have failed to recognise the breadth of Mr Hill's hypothesis as to the aetiology of his pathological gambling: it was either that he developed pathological gambling during his operational service, or that the seeds for the condition were sown during that period, associated with substance abuse and his depressive disorder. The AAT expressly recognised both those alternatives. Its rejection of the claim involved firstly rejecting the reasonableness of the hypothesis that the clinical onset of pathological gambling occurred during his service, and then that its later onset was in some way connected to his service. In the AAT's reasons, there is nothing which in my view suggests that it imposed an onus of proof upon Mr Hill on this issue, rather than addressing the question it was required to address.</text>

<text>79 Notwithstanding the characteristics of the material referred to by the Repatriation Commission, I was left with the firm view that Dr Parker (whose evidence on this topic was accepted) considered that alcohol intoxication preceded, and continued to exist to, the time when Mr Hill had the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. As the AAT said, it did not need to prefer his evidence to reach that view, so long as it was rational and available to support the hypothesis: see the comments of Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ in Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 414-415. The fact that both alcohol intoxication and alcohol dependence arose after Mr Hill commenced his operational service was clearly consistent with his and other's evidence about his alcohol consumption before that time, although it noted one drinking episode before that time which (the AAT said) fitted with the diagnostic description of alcohol intoxication. The AAT made the observation that it was implicit in the evidence of both specialists (Dr Parker and Professor Goldney) that Mr Hill's pattern of alcohol consumption in Vietnam represented deterioration or worsening of a psychiatric condition. Having considered the evidence of Dr parker, as the AAT's preferred witness on this topic, that is a fair observation. The AAT also had the evidence of Professor Varghese that alcohol dependence usually develops gradually. Dr Parker's evidence was described in the AAT's reasons as saying that
 
 "... the behaviour exhibited by Mr Hill was that of a diagnosable condition of alcohol intoxication, which condition at some stage later, but still while he was in Vietnam, developed into dependency."
 

It did so in the light of his cross-examination. That reliably reflects his evidence. He was speculative as to the precise dates of onset of each of those conditions, but not as to the fact of their onset or as to their sequence. His evidence supports the critical issue the existence of alcohol intoxication at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence. That was material upon which the AAT could have reached its conclusion that a reasonable hypothesis had been raised by reason of either cl 5(a) or cl 5(c) of the AD SOP being met, i.e. that one of the alternative minimum factors specified for the existence of a reasonable hypothesis connecting Mr Hill's alcohol dependence with his operational service.

87 One variation of this submission was to start with the observation of Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ in Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 414-415 that it will be rare that a hypothesis, based on the raised facts, is unreasonable when it is put forward by a medical practitioner with appropriate expertise. The AAT was not unmindful of that statement. It referred to it elsewhere in its reasons. But the AAT did not regard the "raised facts" as supporting the hypothesis first suggested by Dr Parker, and as it explained upon all the evidence, Dr Parker's initial view came to be qualified. It was left with material upon which it did not regard the hypotheses put forward by Mr Hill as reasonable. In my view, it did not somehow misapply the law which, earlier in its reasons, it had correctly identified as applicable. In particular, it did not commit the error discerned in Repatriation Commission v Whetton (1991) 31 FCR 513 of reversing the question posed by s 120(3) to the positive existence of a reasonable hypothesis. That case, upon which counsel for Mr Hill relied, was quite different factually: the uncontroverted evidence in that case was that during service the deceased serviceman had been substantially exposed to material which could have led to the disease from which he did; the evidence in this matter in relation to pathological gambling did not go anywhere near so far.

107 I do not think that the decisions referred to by counsel for Mr Hill in this context dictate a contrary conclusion. Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; 175 CLR 408 concerned the process by which a diagnosed disease might be connected to service. It proceeded on the basis of the claimant having suffered essential hypertension. So the question of "diagnosis" (to use the AAT's word) was not in issue. So too in Byrnes v Repatriation Commission (1993) 177 CLR 465. The claimant's condition of cervical and thoracic spondylosis was not in issue. What was in issue was its relationship to his service, in that case in the Royal Australian Navy between 1942 and 1945.</text>

<tocase>Mines v Repatriation Commission (2004) 86 ALD 62</tocase>
<text>104 In Mines v Repatriation Commission (2004) 86 ALD 62, Gray J after referring to the Full Court decisions I mentioned in [44] above said at 74, [48]:
 
 It is therefore clear that the question whether a veteran is suffering, or has suffered, a claimed injury or disease must be determined to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision-maker, that is, on the balance of probabilities. That question is not to be determined by asking whether there is a reasonable hypothesis that the veteran is suffering, or has suffered, the injury or disease and asking whether the material establishes that the facts supporting that hypothesis do not exist beyond reasonable doubt. If the question is posed as whether a veteran has suffered PTSD as a result of a traumatic event said to have occurred during the veteran's operational service, it must be answered by saying that the decision-maker must be reasonably satisfied that the traumatic event occurred before reaching the conclusion that the veteran suffered PTSD. Only if such a conclusion is reached does the reasonable hypothesis process of reasoning, outlined in the four steps referred to in Deledio , come into operation.

105 Counsel for Mr Hill did not directly attack the correctness of that decision. It being a long standing decision of a judge of the Court, unless I am persuaded that it is clearly wrong, I should follow it. I propose to do so. Indeed, I respectfully agree with Gray J, and that his Honour's conclusion flowed from the Full Court decisions referred to.

106 It is perhaps curious that, once a disease is found to exist so that the decision-making process explained in the Deledio steps commences, a question may arise which asks firstly in a hypothetical way and then by the application of the reverse criminal onus of proof, the same question (or almost the same question) as is required to be answered as a fact to the decision-maker's satisfaction in the process of finding if a claimant suffers a particular disease. But that is the case where the existence of a disease such as PTSD requires as a fact the experiencing of a stressor (by its nature and definition).</text>
