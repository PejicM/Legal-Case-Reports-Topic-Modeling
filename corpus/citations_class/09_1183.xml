<text>Should those orders be continued against other respondents who are members of the NUW? The answer to this question depends on whether, as members, they are bound to perform and observe the Rules by engaging or not engaging in the conduct which is the subject of his Honour's orders. As officers, they were subject to the rules because they owed fiduciary obligations to the union: cf Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431 at 483. Members, as such, do not have equivalent fiduciary obligations.

Mr Borenstein nonetheless argued that members of an organisation are under an obligation not to act against the interests of the organisation of which they are members. He submitted that the Rules constituted a compact which defined the relationship between the member and the union. There was, he submitted, an implied restraint against a member acting against the interests of the union by procuring resignations by other members. He referred to Rule 3 of the NUW rules, which provides that, where a member acts in a way that conflicts with the objects of the union, that member may be subject to a charge under Rule 67 for failing to observe the rules of the union.

The only object to which he referred was that found in rule 2(44) which was 'To enrol into membership of the union all employees eligible to become members of the union'.</text>

<tocase>Cook v Crawford (1982) 43 ALR 83</tocase>
<text>It is arguable that Rule 2(44) may give rise to a negative implication that employees who have been induced to enrol as members should not, thereafter, be encouraged by other members to resign their membership. There may be some support to be found for the existence of such an implication in dicta in the judgment of Smithers J in Cook v Crawford (1982) 43 ALR 83 at 116. His Honour there said: 
 
 "Whatever reasons the appellants may have had for thinking that their resistance was justifiable, there could, of course, be no justification of any kind for members and officers of the organisation actually to attempt to induce other members to resign from it. To try to reduce the membership of the organization whilst remaining members and officers thereof was conduct which could only be described as most reprehensible. Whether or not there was some expressed or implied rule of the organisation which forbade members to engage in such conduct, it conflicted with every implied obligation of official duty" (emphasis added).

It is not necessary, in dealing with interim Orders, to come to a concluded view as to whether or not there is an obligation, which may be enforced against a member of an organisation under s 164, not to prejudice the interests of the organisation by encouraging fellow members to resign. It is sufficient that I conclude, as I do, that this is a serious question which will require attention at a final hearing. Accordingly, I reject the application that Orders 1(a) and 1(b) of Gray J's Orders be vacated insofar as they apply to respondents who are presently members of the NUW.

Order 1(c) is in a different category. It was made at a time when it was normal practice for a single application to be made, or concurrent applications to be made, by aspiring members who wished to join the NUW and the NUWQ. This was convenient because the Queensland branch of the NUW and the NUWQ had the same office bearers, operated out of the same offices, and acted as if they were a single entity. It was not, however, appropriate that respondents who were officers of the NUW should be recruiting workers to be members of the NUWQ to the exclusion of the NUW.</text>
