<tocase>Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for the Environment (No. 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>10 Gunns also contends that there is no evidence that those persons who stand behind LFF do not have the funds to provide security, so that it can't be concluded that the litigation would be stifled because of a security for costs order. That submission is rejected. There is a relevant difference between members of a non-profit voluntary association formed for some public policy purpose and shareholders of a company. Members of LFF do not stand to gain any financial benefit from the proceeding. The proceeding is one in which LFF sues for its own benefit to advance a purpose or purposes for which it was formed; see Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for the Environment (No 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1 at 21-22, per Branson J and Tigers AFC (Mayne) Inc v The AFL and Others [2000] FCA 1650 at [28] to [29] per Spender J.</text>

<tocase>Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>14 The discretion to make a security for costs order is wide and unfettered but must be exercised judicially; see Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 3. As the only factor of any substance raised in support of the proposed order is LFF's impecuniosity, Gunns has not satisfied its onus of demonstrating that a security for costs order should be made. To hold otherwise would stifle the litigation and prevent an applicant with standing to bring the application from agitating a matter which it considers to involve questions of public importance and which seems, on the material currently before the Court, to be made bona fide and raises arguable questions of law.

15 The Court will order as follows:
 
1. The second respondent's motion dated 24 January 2008 is dismissed.
 
2. The second respondent pay the applicant's costs of, and associated with the motion, including the costs of compliance with subpoenas, to be taxed in default of agreement.

 I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.
