<text>6 The conduct was, in all the circumstances, "unconscionable". That term, in this section, is not limited as it is in s 12CA by a connection with the unwritten law (cf s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51; GPG (Australia Trading) Pty Ltd v GIO Australia Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1761 ; (2001) 117 FCR 23 at [113] [126]). Section 12CB is the equivalent of s 51AB of the Trade Practices Act (as to which, see, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Radio Rentals Ltd [2005] FCA 1133 ; (2005) 146 FCR 292 at [23] [24]). The width of the concept is underlined by the factors referred to in s 12CB(2).</text>

<text>3 Two general points can be made. First, each of s 12CB(1) and s 12DA(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) prohibits certain conduct by "a person" which, in the absence of any special definition, includes a natural person. As all of the conduct in this case occurred in the Australian Capital Territory, the sections apply according to their terms (s 4(1) together with the definitions of "Territory" and "this jurisdiction" in s 5 of the Act). Second, there is no difficulty in each of the first and second defendants being responsible for the conduct of the first defendant ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).

4 Section 12CB(1) provides as follows:
 
 "A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person, engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable."

5 There is no doubt that what occurred was "in trade or commerce". "Financial service" is defined in s 12BAB of the Act. That, in turn, incorporates the definition of "financial product" in s 12BAA. A "credit facility" (within the meaning of the regulations) is such a product (s 12BAA(7)(k)). Regulation 2B of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Regulations 2001 (Cth) defines "credit facility" in a manner that is apt to pick up what took place between the second defendant, Mr Biega and Pepper Homeloans.</text>
