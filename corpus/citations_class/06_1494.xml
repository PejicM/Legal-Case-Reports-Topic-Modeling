<tocase>Barrett v The Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 18 ALD 129</tocase>
<text>3. The applicant to pay the costs of the first respondent and the State of Queensland, to be taxed if not otherwise agreed.
 
3 In my view the orders I made this morning are interlocutory orders as they do not finally determine all rights of the parties in issue. (An order upholding an objection to competency on the basis that a decision is not reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act') is an interlocutory decision: Meredith v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 271 ; (2002) 125 FCR 308. Similarly an order rejecting an application for an extension of time to commence proceedings under the ADJR Act is an interlocutory order: Barrett v The Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 18 ALD 129.)</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hydrocarbon Products Pty Ltd (1987) 72 ALR 391</tocase>
<text>7 The principles applicable to granting leave to appeal from interlocutory orders are reasonably well settled. It is necessary to show that the order in respect of which leave to appeal is sought is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered, and that substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hydrocarbon Products Pty Ltd (1987) 72 ALR 391, Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 539.

8 I am very conscious that there are concurrent criminal proceedings in the Magistrates Court at Brisbane in respect of the applicant. The proceedings in the Magistrates Court are part-heard and are scheduled for further hearing on 22-24 January 2007. I am concerned that this Court may be being used to prevent those criminal proceedings in the Magistrates Court continuing as scheduled. Further, I note that the next scheduled Full Court hearings in this Court, which could hear an appeal by the applicant from the orders I made this morning, are not until February 2007. However, in applying the principles in Hydrocarbon Products and Telstra Corporation , I am satisfied that the orders in respect of which leave to appeal is sought are attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration in the sense that:
 
&#8226; the orders raise important issues of law and the jurisdiction of the Federal Court under the ADJR Act, particularly in respect of s 9A, and
 
&#8226; it is appropriate that these issues receive consideration by the Full Court.</text>
