<tocase>Northern Territory v Alyawarr (2005) 145 FCR 442</tocase>
<text>A determination of native title in Aboriginal people by orders of the Federal Court in the exercise of power conferred by the Native Title Act , is the expression, consistent with the scheme of the Act, of what the Chief Justice of Australia, Chief Justice French, has described as the "beneficial purpose" of the legislation to provide for the recognition and protection of native title, as set out in s 3 of the Act. That beneficial purpose rests on a declared "moral foundation" ( Northern Territory v Alyawarr (2005) 145 FCR 442 at [63]) contained in the preamble to the Act as acknowledged by the High Court of Australia in Mabo v Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 CLR 1, that the common law of Australia recognises, a form of native title, that reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia, in accordance with their laws and customs, to their traditional lands. When the Federal Court makes a determination of native title in Aboriginal people, it does so in recognition of traditional laws, customs, rights and interests subsisting in those people as part of the common law of Australia.</text>
