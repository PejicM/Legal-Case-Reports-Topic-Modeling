<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/869.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The first respondent submitted that no grounds of appeal had been made out and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. In an outline of submissions filed on 2 December 2005, the first respondent submitted that it was open to Riethmuller FM to refuse the appellant's application for an adjournment of the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court for the reasons given by his Honour. I agree. Riethmuller FM was entitled to take the view that the most appropriate order in the interests of justice, bearing in mind the matters relied on by the appellant, the previous history of the proceedings, and the needs of other litigants and the Court, was to decline to adjourn the hearing: see SZBFL v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 869 at [8] - [10] ; Applicant MZQAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1801 at [5] ; and NALM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 17 at [22] - [26] . As to the substantive contentions which the appellant advanced in his written contentions, Riethmuller FM was also entitled to find that there had been no failure by the Tribunal to take relevant facts into consideration, and that the Tribunal had not erred by taking irrelevant facts into consideration. Further, his Honour was entitled to find that there was nothing to support the contentions that the decision was made in bad faith or that the Tribunal's decision was unreasonable: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [11] - [13] , [16]-[19].</text>

<text>13 As his Honour pointed out, the Tribunal was required to determine whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, based upon the appellant's particular claims. It was not required to make a determination based on the overall economic and social situation of the lower level castes in India in general: see Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 29 at [158] - [160] . On the evidence before it, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant belonged to the scheduled tribe. More particularly, it was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Both these findings were open to the Tribunal: see NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 at [5] ; and NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 at [4] - [5] .</text>
