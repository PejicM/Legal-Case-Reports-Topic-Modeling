<text>6 In the proceedings in this Court, the Commonwealth had attempted, one way and another, to have determined separately and early the question of whether there was a justiciable duty of care by the Commonwealth to its citizens as alleged, in order, if there were not, to narrow the factual issues in the case. That legal question is, at present, an open one: Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574. In the course of interlocutory proceedings related to such procedural attempt by the Commonwealth, Mr Habib first made the allegation that he had actually been in the Australian High Commission to the knowledge of at least one Commonwealth officer, Mr Adams. Counsel for the Commonwealth then conceived, correctly as it appears to me, that such an allegation would bear strongly on whether the Commonwealth had a duty of care of the kind alleged.

7 I was then persuaded, over the opposition of the applicant, to try the discrete question, whether Mr Habib had ever been at the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, separately pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . As I indicated in the course of discussion with counsel, prima facie it seemed unlikely that any participation by an Australian officer in the maltreatment of Mr Habib, or turning of a blind eye to it, would have occurred at Australian diplomatic premises. Further, the circumstances alleged by Mr Habib as to how he came to believe and to assert late in the piece that he had been at the High Commission, viewed in the light of the bad treatment he says that he received in Pakistan, Egypt and at a US military base, made it unlikely that to decide the issue I would need to cast any reflection on Mr Habib's truthfulness or even general reliability, such as might prejudice or embarrass a manifestly unbiased trial of the other factual issues in the case. Because of my impending departure from the Court, the trial of other factual issues, and of the legal issues, in the case will be before (or as directed by) another judge.

8 This is now my judgment on a final trial of the factual issue: was Mr Habib ever in the Australian High Commission in Islamabad before he was taken to Egypt?</text>
