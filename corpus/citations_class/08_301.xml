<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>7 The leading authority in relation to the exercise of that discretion is a decision of the Full Federal Court in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187. At page 195 in that case, it is observed that the term " special reasons " is " an elastic test suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period ". I remind myself also that the rules of Court are meant to be a servant of justice, not its master.

8 Later cases have highlighted a number of considerations that are relevant to the granting of an extension of time within which to appeal. These are:
 
 
 (a) the length of the delay involved in the filing of the notice;
 (b) where there is an acceptable explanation for that delay;
 (c) whether the respondent will suffer prejudice by reason of the delay; and 
 (d) the nature of the injustice to the applicant if an extension is not granted.

9 As to the last of these considerations, it can, in particular cases, be relevant to consider the merits of the proposed appeal having regard to the draft notice of appeal grounds. There is no asserted prejudice to the Minister or, for that matter, the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, in relation to the granting of an extension. Further, I can well understand the difficulties faced by a person whose first language is not English and whose command of English is, at best, very limited.</text>
