<text>1 On 20 December 2006 I published my reasons for concluding that the defendant should be found guilty on three charges of contempt (see Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Pappas [2006] FCA 1785]). The present reasons should be understood in the light of and as an extension of those reasons. On 20 December 2006, I gave directions for the parties to make submissions on the appropriate penalty for contempt. I have now received written submissions on behalf of the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (the Commission) and the defendant and have heard oral submissions on behalf of both parties on that question.

2 Ordinarily, subject to satisfaction of certain procedural requirements, the Court has power to impose a term of imprisonment, to impose a fine and to make costs orders as punishment for contempt. The principles that are relevant to the question of penalty in a case such as the present are as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; the seriousness of the contempt;
 &#8226; whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences of contempt;
 &#8226; the actual or potential consequences of the contempt;
 &#8226; the reason or motive for the contempt;
 &#8226; whether the contemnor has received or will receive a benefit from the contempt;
 &#8226; whether genuine contrition has been expressed by the contemnor;
 &#8226; the character and antecedents of the contemnor;
 &#8226; what punishment is required to deter the contemnor in particular and others of a like mind generally from similar disobedience to orders of the Court. 
 

The defendant did not quarrel with those principles as being relevant to the assessment of penalty in the present proceeding.

3 However, the defendant points to a failure to comply with the Rules of the Federal Court concerning enforcement of orders of the Court by committal. He says that, having regard to failure to comply with the Rules in connection with the Court's order of 16 September 2005, the punishment, at least in relation to the first two charges, should not include imprisonment. It is, therefore, desirable to say something about the relevant provisions of the Rules.</text>
