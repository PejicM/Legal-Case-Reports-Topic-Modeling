<tocase>Cheesman v Waters (1997) 77 FCR 221</tocase>
<text>5 The proposition that an intervener becomes a party to the proceedings, the Second Respondent pointed out, also was accepted in Cheesman v Waters (1997) 77 FCR 221 at 227, another decision of the Full Court. Moreover, in United States Tobacco the Court referred with approval to the following passage from the judgment of Hutley JA, with whom Reynolds and Glass JJA agreed, in Corporate Affairs Commission v Bradley [1974] 1 NSWLR 391, 396:
 
 
 "A person accepted as an intervener becomes a party to the proceedings with all the privileges of a party. Thus he can appeal, tender evidence and participate fully in all aspects of the argument. His position is quite different from that of an amicus curiae. Interveners have been allowed to appeal. Thus the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth appealed to the Privy Council in the Boilermakers' case ..., though he was only an intervener in the High Court..."

14 The other case postdating the new intervention rules, cited by counsel for the Commonwealth, Peacock v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2005] FCAFC 45 , does not illuminate the present question. In that case the Full Court said, obiter , at [75]:
 
 
 "The Attorney-General certainly was entitled to intervene if he wished: s 78A Judiciary Act . If the Attorney had elected to intervene he would thereby have become a party to the proceeding: Cheesman v Waters (1997) 77 FCR 221."</text>

<tocase>United States Tobacco v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520</tocase>
<text>4 In maintaining its opposition to the application, counsel for the Commonwealth has submitted that Order 52, r 14 requires in terms that "each party to the proceeding in the court appealed from ... shall be joined as a party ... to the appeal" and he relies upon the observations of the Full Court in United States Tobacco v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520 where it was said, at 534:
 
 
 "An intervener, whether pursuant to s 12 of the ADJR Act, O 6, r 8(1) of the Federal Court Rules , s 78A of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) or otherwise , becomes a party to the proceedings with the benefits and burdens of that status." (Emphasis added).

5 The proposition that an intervener becomes a party to the proceedings, the Second Respondent pointed out, also was accepted in Cheesman v Waters (1997) 77 FCR 221 at 227, another decision of the Full Court.
