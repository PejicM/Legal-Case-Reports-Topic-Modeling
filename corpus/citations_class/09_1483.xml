<tocase>Re Amcor Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 199</tocase>
<text>I have considered all of the material filed in support of the application. I am satisfied that the scheme of arrangement ought to be approved by the Court. The jurisdiction conferred by s 411 of the Act involves the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court. The role of the Court is to determine whether in the face of all the material, there is any basis for apprehension that the members were oppressed in relation to the exercise of their vote; and whether members were sufficiently enabled by the material put before them, to be capable of reaching an informed decision about whether acceptance of the proposal was in their best interests. Fundamentally, the question of whether the proposal ought to be accepted is a matter for the meeting. It is not for the Court to substitute its own view of the merits of the vote, for that of the meeting. If, of course, the meeting reaches a conclusion which seems inconsistent with an objective assessment of the merits of the proposal based on the material put before the meeting, the Court will look closely at the outcome and seek to be satisfied about any matter that might seem to the Court counter-intuitive. Even so, the will of the meeting is paramount subject to the supervision of the Court. If the material clearly explains the proposal and it is capable of acceptance by individuals exercising their best judgment of what is in their own commercial interests or to their own commercial advantage, the Court ought not to withhold approval of the scheme. In the case of a meeting of a single class of members, the Court would need to be satisfied that the vote and thus the will of the meeting had miscarried before withholding approval: Re Amcor Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 199 at [33]; Re Sonodyne International Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 494 at 499; Re Hudson Conway Ltd (2000) 33 ACSR 657; Re Coles Group Ltd (No 2) (2007) 65 ACSR 494; Re NRMA Ltd; Re NRMA Insurance Ltd (2000) 33 ACSR 595.</text>

<text>Felix also seeks an order relieving it from the requirement contained in s 411(11) that a copy of an order of the Court made under s 411(4)(b) be annexed to every copy of the Constitution of Felix issued after the making of the order. There seems to be no utility in the order. The proposed order does not affect any change to the Constitution of the company. Accordingly, there is no need to insist upon compliance by Felix with s 411(11) of the Act: Re Equinox Resources Ltd (2004) 49 ACSR 692 at [22] and [23]; Re Kalgoorlie Lake View Pty Ltd (2005) 56 ACSR 144 at [30] - [32]; and Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 64 ACSR 387 at 409.</text>
