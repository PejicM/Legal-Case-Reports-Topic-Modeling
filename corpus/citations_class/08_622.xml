<text>15 The order which is sought in the present case is in similar terms to an order made by Barrett J in Re Porter and Another as joint administrators of Priceright Construction Pty Limited (2006) 57 ACSR 206 at [7]. His Honour observed at [8] that it is now well recognized that the Court has the power to extend the convening period in a way that s 439A of the Act does not itself allow. See also the decision of Lindgren J in Re Double V Marketing Pty Ltd (in admin) [1995] FCA 1151 ; (1995) 16 ACSR 498.</text>

<text>15 The order which is sought in the present case is in similar terms to an order made by Barrett J in Re Porter and Another as joint administrators of Priceright Construction Pty Limited (2006) 57 ACSR 206 at [7]. His Honour observed at [8] that it is now well recognized that the Court has the power to extend the convening period in a way that s 439A of the Act does not itself allow. See also the decision of Lindgren J in Re Double V Marketing Pty Ltd (in admin) [1995] FCA 1151 ; (1995) 16 ACSR 498.

18 In all the circumstances it seems to me that the orders that are sought ought to be made for the reasons set out in Mr Vouris's affidavit. The orders are in accordance with the terms which Barrett J described in Re Porter at [10] and [12] as appropriate orders to be made in an application of this type.

19 Accordingly I will make orders 1, 2 and 3 as set out in the originating process. I will order that the orders be entered forthwith.

 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

<tocase>Re Taylor (1995) 16 ACSR 774</tocase>
<text>17 The period of the permitted adjournment is within the approach which Brownie J took in Re Taylor (1995) 16 ACSR 774. The effect of what his Honour said was that a further extension which would more than double the period permitted by the Act ought not to be made. The present order would not do so.</text>
