<tocase>Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/367.html</AustLII>
<text>In Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 , Greenwood J refused an application to join a party to an application for an order to review certain decisions relating to the application for a search warrant under the Crimes Act . The party sought to be joined was the person who decided to apply for the search warrant. The circumstances, at least at that level of generality, appear to be the same as those applicable to the decision of the fifth "respondent" (and of the AFP and the DCT, as alleged in paras 9.8 and 9.9 of the amended application). His Honour decided that the decision to swear the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant and to apply for it were not decisions of an administrative character made under an enactment: see s 3(1) of the ADJR Act. Counsel for Mr Nicholls did contend that the decision was plainly wrong and should not be followed: see eg Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. I respectively adopt his Honour's reasons at [60] to [70]. I shall not repeat them.

Is there any point of distinction? In Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 , one contention was that the applicant for the search warrant did not disclose certain information to the Magistrate. In that case, the non-disclosure was of information which the applicant claimed should have been disclosed. At [78] to [80], Greenwood J reviewed certain authorities touching upon the validity of search warrants procured through fraud or the absence of good faith: see eg Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 225 [238] ; Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio [1994] FCA 1286 ; (1994) 52 FCR 542. He accepted at [80] that "the fundament of the duty is a duty to act in good faith and avoid making half-truths giving rise to a misrepresentation". His Honour's focus then was upon whether the applicants in that case had demonstrated an arguable case that in swearing the affidavit in support of the application for, and in applying for, the search warrant the person seeking the search warrant had misrepresented material facts going to the exercise of the power by the Magistrate to issue the warrant.

As is apparent, I have assumed that a decision to provide to the Magistrate in support of the application for the search warrant information which could not lawfully be presented to him (or, somewhat more obliquely, a decision not to inform the Magistrate that information provided to him could not be relied upon by him) is a decision to which the ADJR Act may apply. That is not obviously so, for the reasons discussed in [37] above. In addition, the operative decision directly affecting the rights of Mr Nicholls is that to issue the search warrant. If that decision is not set aside, the operative decision will not have been impaired by the decision complained of itself being attacked. It is probable, in my view, that the cases discussed by Greenwood J in Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 at [78] to [80] point to circumstances which would enliven s 5(1)(g) of the ADJR Act in relation to the decision to issue the warrant, namely that the decision to issue the warrant was induced or affected by fraud. For reasons which appear below, it is not necessary finally to decide whether that is the correct analysis of the decisions referred to. However, in considering whether to permit the amended application to be amended or read in the way which Mr Nicholls now contends, I encompass within that consideration the possibility that ground 9.4 of the amended application might be preserved so as to entertain an attack upon the validity of the decision to issue the search warrant if it were induced or affected by fraud.

Order 35A of the Federal Court Rules empowers the Court to stay or dismiss a proceeding if an applicant is in default, that is, fails to comply with an order of the Court or fails to prosecute a proceeding with due diligence.

The history of the conduct of these proceedings from their commencement indicates repeated failures by Mr Nicholls to comply with the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court and of this Court. His affidavit of 28 November 2008 goes some way to explaining why that is so, but it too was filed at the last moment, and after repeated unexplained failures to comply with orders of the Court. Mr Nicholls deposes to difficulties with funding, and to having to meet various demands and requirements of an administrator of a company with which he was involved as being "consuming and still on-going"; he deposes to being required to spend "considerable time" to prepare for various court hearings, and he says that: 
 
 [his] ability to provide legal instruction to [his] own legal counsel has been hindered, primarily as a result of the following issues: 
 

 
 
 (a) Delays caused by the ATO/AFP to make available the HDDs and suitable equipment to enable access the electronic data for the purposes of [his] claim of LLP in a timely manner; 
 

 
 
 (b) Having to respond to the numerous ATO instigated legal actions against [him] personally and against [his] companies; 
 

 
 
 (c) Having to be self-represented in relation to 47(b); 
 

 
 
 (d) Delays caused by the AFP and ATO in compiling and releasing the requested information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 due to apparent "staff shortages" within each unit; and 
 

 
 
 (e) [His] not being able to access relevant material on the seized HDDs up until only recently to properly instruct [his] legal counsel on a potential claim of LPP and other legal matters relating to the validity and lawfulness of the search warrants. 
 

 
 
 Mr Nicholls also deposes to "endeavouring to secure additional work given [his family's] current financial position", and to him "up-skilling [his] industry experience" by undertaking further study.

The relevant question is whether, upon the proper construction of s 65 of the TAA and ss 263 and 264 of the ITAA, those provisions in their context permit or prohibit the use of information acquired under them for the purpose of applying for a search warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act , and so for the purpose of exercising the power under s 3E. See the discussion in Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 per Greenwood J at [78].

As noted above, s 3E of the TAA expressly recognises that information obtained by the Commissioner under the provisions of a tax law (which by definition includes under the TAA and the ITAA) and which is subject to taxation secrecy provisions may be used for specific purposes. The purposes include its use where the definitional requirements are fulfilled, as they are in this instance for applying for, and in consideration of whether to issue, a search warrant. And, at a later point, ss 3E(3) and (4) prohibit the disclosure of the information coercively obtained under a tax law to a Court other than as voluntarily provided to a court in the course of proceedings for a prosecution of a person for a tax-related offence (and for another presently irrelevant type of proceeding.

By way of contrast, there are legislative examples where information provided to an executive authority under statutory compulsion may not be used in a subsequent criminal prosecution, where additional features (such as a contemporary claim to the privilege against self-incrimination) exist. See for example s 30 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) and s 597 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and the discussion in Cross on Evidence (7 th ed, 2004 at [25055]-[25060]).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1990/520.html</AustLII>
<text>The question is whether Mr Nicholls' serial non-compliance with orders of the Court, in the light of his further contentions and oral submissions, has demonstrated an inability to comply with orders of the Court, or an unpreparedness to present his claim for hearing: see eg Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd [1990] FCA 520 ; (1990) 27 FCR 388 at 396.

In my view, in addition to the refusal to entertain grounds 9.1 and 9.4-9.9 of the amended application because I uphold the Notice of Objection to Competency in respect of them, those grounds should be dismissed by reason of the persistent default of Mr Nicholls.

He has had ample time to clearly identify, in respect of those grounds, the decisions which he attacks and to provide proper particulars of the reasons for doing so. He has still not done so. His Outlines of Contentions and his oral submissions through counsel have in reality exposed that his attack upon the decision to issue the search warrant and decisions surrounding it are of quite narrow compass. The attack is confined to the alleged use (and alleged misuse) of certain information to support the application for the search warrant which had been compulsorily acquired from Mr Nicholls. That does not generally impinge upon the decision to apply for the search warrant, or upon decisions as to when and how the search warrant was executed. The material indicates, in my view, that Mr Nicholls has demonstrated an inability to comply with orders of the Court in respect of those grounds of the amended application. Otherwise, over the space of six months, he would have been able to properly specify and detail the foundation for those claims.</text>

<tocase>Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/1992/3851.html</AustLII>
<text>For these reasons, in my view, Mr Nicholls' first proposition set out at [33] above, expressed as generally as it is, is not fairly arguable. It is inconsistent with s 3E of the TAA. The same applies to his second proposition. The cases which are said expressly to establish those propositions do not do so. Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 concerned the question whether Mr Johns, who had provided information to the ASC under compulsion, was entitled to be heard before that information was provided to a Royal Commission. The provision of the information to the Royal Commission was permitted by s 127(4) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth) (the ASC Act), but it was held that Mr Johns was entitled to have been heard before the provision of that information on an unrestricted basis (see esp per Crennan J at 430-1). Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 62 ; (2005) 52 ACSR 374 concerned the use to which material seized under a search warrant executed by the AFP and made available to ASIC could then be used by ASIC in the conduct of civil proceedings: see per Austin J at 421-9 [239]-[274] and, in particular, his Honour's conclusion at 429 [274]. That is a different issue to either of the first two propositions of Mr Nicholls. Finally, he referred to Commissioner of Taxation v De Vonk (1995) 61 FCR 564. That case addressed the validity of a decision to issue a notice under s 564 of the ITAA where criminal proceedings against the person to whom the notice had been issued had already been commenced. Foster J (who generally agreed with the plurality judgment of Hill and Lindgren JJ) noted at 568 that it was conceded on behalf of the respondent that information so acquired, provided it was acquired for a proper purpose (which his Honour said was the purpose of obtaining information for the collection and protection of the revenue), could be forwarded to the prosecution to assist in a criminal prosecution. The confined nature of that purpose is recognised by the restriction recognised in s 4E(3) and (4) of the TAA referred to above.

Nor do I consider that the third proposition of Mr Nicholls, if I understand it, is fairly arguable. He referred only to Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; 178 CLR 408 in support of the proposition, but the circumstances of that case were quite different. It may be accepted, as the respondents accept, that the tax secrecy provisions generally make information provided to the DCT under compulsion confidential. There may arise circumstances where the permitted use of that material (whether under s 3E of the TAA or under some other provision) might be construed so as to entitle the provider of it to be heard before that permitted use occurred, at least as to the terms upon which the permitted use might occur. Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; 178 CLR 408 is an example under s 127 of the ASC Act. But that case does not advance Mr Nicholls' third proposition where the permitted use to rely upon the compulsorily acquired and otherwise confidential information to support an application for a search warrant does not publicly expose the information and indeed the issuing officer is prevented by s 3E(2B) of the TAA from disclosing it. Mr Nicholls through counsel did not advance any detailed contention, based upon the terms of s 3E or its context or in any other respect to support the proposition.

Consequently, I would not allow the amended application to be further amended to give effect to the now confined propositions of Mr Nicholls relating to the decision to include in the material submitted to the Magistrate certain information which was coercively acquired from Mr Nicholls or from the two banks. That is simply because I consider his propositions not to be fairly arguable. It follows that I would uphold the claims of the AFP and the DCT that grounds 9.2 and 9.3 of the amended application as presently expressed should also be dismissed for Mr Nicholls' failure to comply with the orders of the Court.

There are two further reasons why I would make that order.</text>
