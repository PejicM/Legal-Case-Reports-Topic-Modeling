<text>112 In Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 422 Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ, after referring to the criteria listed in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283, said:
 
 "as Deane J has observed [in Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 121], the cases in which the criteria ... have been applied in this Court are cases in which there was a formal contract, complete on its face. He pointed out that a rigid approach should be avoided in cases, such as the present, where there is no formal contract. In those cases the actual terms of the contract must first be inferred before any question of implication arises. That is to say, it is necessary to arrive at some conclusion as to the actual intention of the parties before considering any presumed or imputed intention."</text>

<tocase>Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15 ; (1988) 164 CLR 539</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/15.html</AustLII>
<text>113 Their Honours then quoted the observations of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15 ; (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 573 as to the test to be applied in cases where the parties have not spelt out the full terms of their contract:
 
 "a court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intention of the parties if, but only if, it can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case."

114 Given what was agreed between the parties (as to which see [105]), the term in par 3(f) cannot be implied. Harold and Saul are entitled to use the name as long as they operate the City restaurant. It is accordingly not necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of the contract that they have ownership rights in the name. For them to have such rights would be inconsistent with the agreement that was in fact made. I note that in the applicants' written submissions the implication of this term is predicated on "the express agreement" of the parties upon the terms pleaded in par 3(a) to (e) of the statement of claim. Of course essential parts of that agreement have not been upheld.

115 It is clear from alleged terms 3(f) and (g) that the latter is dependent on the former. That is to say, it is because the parties are joint owners of the intellectual property that none of them can use the name Squires Loft without the consent of all of them. Even if sub-par (g) were independent of (f), I do not consider that it is to be implied. In determining whether it is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of the contract to imply such a term, it is appropriate to take into account that the draft licence prepared in June 1997, given by Lionel to Saul for his consideration, contained in clause 3.32, to which Lionel's marginal notes drew Saul's attention, a provision that the licensee was not entitled to prevent the use of the name Squires Loft by any other licensee. Saul expressed no concern about this provision, though another provision in that clause did not accord with the arrangements between the parties and was to be corrected. Further, the whole tenor of Harold and Saul's case is that there would be other licensees or franchisees who would be entitled to use the name. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that it is necessary to imply the term in par 3(g). I note that in their written submissions the applicants did not seek to support the implication of this term.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2001/61.html</AustLII>
<text>117 Traditionally, contract formation is analysed in terms of offer and acceptance. However, as Heydon JA recognised in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 179, offer and acceptance are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain every case. While it is an error to assume that because something has been done, there must be a contract pursuant to which it has been done, a contract may nevertheless be inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties: Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117 per McHugh JA (Hope and Mahoney JJA concurring); Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 at 80 83; Geebung Investments Pty Ltd v Varga Group Investments No 8 Pty Ltd (1995) 7 BPR 14,551 at 14,569; (1995) Aust Contract Reps |P90-059 at 90,322. The relevant conduct of the parties must be capable of proving all the essential elements of the alleged contract, so that if the conduct is too ambiguous or vague to establish a contract with legal certainty, no contract will be inferred.</text>

<tocase>James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd [1970] AC 583</tocase>
<text>118 It has generally been accepted since the House of Lords decision in James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd [1970] AC 583 that while evidence of subsequent conduct is admissible to determine the existence of a contract, it is not admissible to determine the terms of a contract: see D W McLauchlan, "Contract Formation, Contract Interpretation, and Subsequent Conduct" (2006) 25 University of Queensland Law Journal 77. This rule must be understood in its context. Subsequent conduct is not admissible to resolve ambiguities in a contract the existence of which is not disputed. But such a rule would be nonsensical in the case of contracts the existence of which is only ascertained or confirmed by subsequent conduct. In such cases, the subsequent conduct does not resolve ambiguities but rather discloses whether the parties reached agreement and the content of such agreement. Without evidence of subsequent conduct relevant to the terms of the contract, all that could be said is that the parties reached agreement; it could not be said about what. I therefore agree with the following passage from the judgment of Nettle JA (with which Chernov and Ashley JJA concurred) in Husain v O &amp; S Holdings (Vic) Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 269 at [51] :
 
 "a manifestation of mutual assent may be made even though neither offer or acceptance can be identified and even though the moment of formation cannot be determined. In point of principle I see no reason why that sort of analysis should not apply as much to an aspect or term of a contractual relationship as to the existence of the relationship itself." 
 

I was not taken to any detailed judicial analysis of this question and nor was it addressed at any length by the parties. It is therefore not appropriate to say anything more other than that there are many unresolved questions in this area. There is a world of grey between the two clear extremes of a written contract and a contract "drifted into" by subsequent conduct. This case is not the vehicle in which to determine the extent to which subsequent conduct is relevant to ascertaining the terms of these grey area contracts.</text>

<tocase>The Aramis [1989] 1 Lloyd's Rep 213</tocase>
<text>119 A court will not lightly infer a contract from the conduct of the parties. In The Aramis [1989] 1 Lloyd's Rep 213, Bingham LJ said the relevant questions in that case were whether the conduct of each party would be reasonably understood by the other as being either an offer or the acceptance of that offer, on the terms contended for. His Lordship said, at [1989] 1 Lloyd's Rep 224:
 
 "I do not think it is enough for the party seeking the implication of a contract to obtain 'it might' as an answer to these questions, for it would, in my view, be contrary to principle to countenance the implication of a contract from conduct if the conduct relied upon is no more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract. It must, surely, be necessary to identify conduct referable to the contract contended for or, at the very least, conduct inconsistent with there being no contract made between the parties to the effect contended for. Put another way, I think it must be fatal to the implication of a contract if the parties would or might have acted exactly as they did in the absence of a contract." 
 

Similarly in Pacific Brands Sports and Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [47] , Finkelstein J said: "If the conduct in question is consistent with an intention not to contract, for example, if the conduct is referable to some other obligation, a contract by conduct will not arise."</text>

<tocase>The Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/39.html</AustLII>
<text>128 In The Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 444 Deane J said:
 
 "Since an estoppel will not arise unless the party claiming the benefit of it has adopted the assumption as the basis of action or inaction and thereby placed himself in a position of significant disadvantage if departure from the assumption be permitted, the resolution of an issue of estoppel by conduct will involve an examination of the relevant belief, actions and position of that party."

129 I have examined the evidence of Harold and Saul about the ownership of the name Squires Loft at [63] to [68]. As there indicated, I am not persuaded that either of them was alert to the difference between a permission to use Lionel and Joel's intellectual property, in particular the name, and a conferring of ownership rights in that property or name. Notwithstanding the stance they have since taken, namely that they became joint owners of the intellectual property, I am satisfied that all they thought they were getting was a right to use the name in the conduct of the City restaurant. The same applies to the other items of intellectual property: the recipes for the sauces for example.

130 Even if I had concluded that Harold and Saul believed they were being given ownership rights in the intellectual property, in particular the name, I would not have upheld the estoppel. In Verwayen at 444-445 Deane J said:
 
 "The question whether such a departure would be unconscionable relates to the conduct of the allegedly estopped party in all the circumstances. That party must have played such a part in the adoption of, or persistence in, the assumption that he would be guilty of unjust and oppressive conduct if he were now to depart from it. The cases indicate four main, but not exhaustive, categories in which an affirmative answer to that question may be justified, namely, where that party: (a) has induced the assumption by express or implied representation; (b) has entered into contractual or other material relations with the other party on the conventional basis of the assumption; (c) has exercised against the other party rights which would exist only if the assumption were correct; (d) knew that the other party laboured under the assumption and refrained from correcting him when it was his duty in conscience to do so. 
 ... 
 In cases falling within category (a), a critical consideration will commonly be that the allegedly estopped party knew or intended or clearly ought to have known that the other party would be induced by his conduct to adopt, and act on the basis of, the assumption."

131 Did Lionel and Joel play such a part in the adoption of the pleaded assumption that they would be guilty of unjust or oppressive conduct if they were now to depart from it? In my view they did not play such a part. I do not regard any of the matters listed in [126] as constituting conduct by them that they would have thought would lead Harold and Saul to assume that the parties were joint owners of the intellectual property, in particular the name. In relation to matter (c) in [127], the tenor of the St Kilda joint venture agreement is inconsistent with the Squires Loft name being owned by the parties rather than Squires Loft Pty Ltd. At the time of the conduct in [127] I am satisfied that Lionel and Joel did not know or intend that Harold and Saul would be induced by it or any of it to adopt, and act on the basis of, the assumption that the parties were joint owners of the intellectual property, in particular the name. Nor do I consider that Lionel and Joel clearly ought to have known that they would.

132 The second assumption pleaded by the applicants is not a live issue. Lionel and Joel accept, in my view correctly, that Harold and Saul have the right to operate the City restaurant under the name Squires Loft. Had they not accepted that position, I would have upheld the second assumption, and held that they were not at liberty to depart from it by preventing Harold and Saul from so operating the City restaurant. I will deal later with whether the right has been lost.</text>

<tocase>Challender v Royle (1987) 4 RPC 363</tocase>
<text>165 The elements of s 129(1) are made out. The only issue arises under sub-s (4). Paragraph (a) of sub-s (4) requires the trade mark in question to be registered, however it is silent as to whether the registration must be a valid registration or whether an invalid registration will suffice. This issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in Challender v Royle (1887) 4 RPC 363. That case concerned the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act 1883 (UK), s 32 of which has become s 129 of the present Act. Section 32 provided as follows:
 
 "Where any person claiming to be the patentee of an invention, by circulars advertisements or otherwise threatens any other person with any legal proceedings or liability in respect of any alleged manufacture use sale or purchase of the invention, any person or persons aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him, and may obtain an injunction against the continuance of such threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as may have been sustained thereby, if the alleged manufacture, use, sale, or purchase to which the threats related was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the person making such threats: Provided that this section shall not apply if the person making such threats with due diligence commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of his patent."

166 The question in that case was whether the defendant, in the course of defending the claim that he had made a threat to which s 32 applied, was entitled to attack the validity of the plaintiff's patent. Cotton LJ said, at 371, that:
 
 "the Court must be satisfied 'that the act complained of is not in fact an infringement of any legal right of the person making such threats' ... the question whether the patent of the person making the threats is a valid patent must come into consideration if the plaintiff in the action seeks it, because I cannot see how, if a patent is invalid, there can be any act done in infringement of a legal right when the legal right depends only on the validity of that patent."

167 The issue arose again in Pittevil &amp; Co v Brackelsberg Melting Processes Ltd (1931) 49 RPC 23. At this time the relevant act was the Patents and Designs Act 1907 1919 (UK), s 36 of which had been s 32 of the 1907 Act. The only relevant amendment to that section was that the words "any legal rights of the person making such threats" had been replaced by "the patent". It was argued that Challender v Royle did not apply since the term "patent" encompassed both inventions and alleged inventions. Thus, it was argued, the section applied even if the patent was invalid and so the validity of a patent could not be challenged in a threats case. The Court of Appeal did not accept this argument, holding that amendments otherwise having the effect of broadening the scope of the section should not be read as cutting down a right established by judicial authority, particularly since the amendment was contained only in the schedule to the amending act. Challender v Royle was therefore applied.

169 No cases have considered whether what had been said in Challender and Pittevil applied to the 1955 Act. However the first edition of D R Shanahan, Australian Trade Mark Law and Practice (1982) at 383 cited Pittevil , and concluded that "it is necessary that the registration be valid and it appears to be open to the plaintiff to plead the invalidity of the registration without actually seeking revocation". The present Act continued, in sub-s (4), the highlighted requirements of s 124 of the 1955 Act cited above.

170 The position established by Challender v Royle , that a defendant in a threat case may argue invalidity of the registration, is supported by sound policy considerations, as the passage from Cotton LJ cited at [166] demonstrates. It seems unlikely that subsequent re-workings of the original legislative provision, which have expanded and clarified the right to bring a proceeding where a threat is made, would have displaced what was said in Challender v Royle without clear words. Both the report of the Attorney-General's committee into the 1955 Act ("Report of the Committee Appointed by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to Consider what Alterations are Desirable in the Trade Marks Law of the Commonwealth (1954)" and the Explanatory Memorandum for the current Act are silent on the question. On their face, the meaning of the words in s 129(4)(a) - "the trade mark is registered" - is clear. However, when the history of the threat provision is examined, there is no basis for saying that any version of the trade mark legislation has changed the position set out in Challender v Royle and Pittevil . Further, the words in the emphasis in [168] "the acts ... constitute ... an infringement of the trade mark" seem to pick up the concept in the passage from Cotton LJ's reasons set out at [166]. In those circumstances the words should be understood as meaning "the trade mark is validly registered". It follows that the applicants have failed to make out par (a) of sub-s (4), since the trade mark is invalid.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1933/48.html</AustLII>
<text>174 In this connection the respondents rely on J H Coles Pty Ltd v Need [1933] HCA 48 ; (1933) 49 CLR 499. There the appellant (Coles) and Need entered into an agreement that Need would open a shop and conduct a business therefrom under Coles' trade name, the business being similar to that conducted by Coles. Need was to buy all his stock from Coles at a concession price. No time was fixed for the duration of the agreement. Coles' name was affixed to the shop front. Initially Need purchased all his stock from Coles, but after a while Coles was unable to supply the whole of Need's requirements, and he obtained some of his stock elsewhere. After about three years, his purchases from Coles were negligible. Coles was then in voluntary liquidation. Its liquidator required Need to remove the Coles trade name from his shop, and on his refusal, brought an action to restrain him from continuing to use the name.

175 Irvine CJ granted the injunction. His Honour found that Coles had granted Need a licence to use its name, that no period had been fixed for the grant, that the licence had been duly determined by notice, the implied term of the licence being that it should last as long as the buying and selling on the terms and prices arranged should go on, and that these matters having ceased, Coles was entitled to revoke the licence.

176 The Full Court upheld the Chief Justice's decision. Before the Full Court Need contended that he had acquired by assignment of Coles' goodwill a right to use its trade name permanently or indefinitely. This is the Court rejected, confirming the Chief Justice's conclusion that Need had no more than a licence to use the name, which had been revoked.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1931/55.html</AustLII>
<text>177 The High Court, by majority, allowed Need's appeal: Need v J H Coles Pty Ltd [1931] HCA 55 ; (1931) 46 CLR 470. The Privy Council allowed Coles' appeal. The Board agreed with the reasoning of the Chief Justice, the Full Court and the dissenting judges in the High Court, Starke and Dixon JJ. Their Lordships said, at 46 CLR 503:
 
 "all the right that the respondent ever had in regard to the user of the appellant's trade names was a revocable licence to use these names so long as the business arrangement continued between the appellant and respondent. From these conclusions it follows that prima facie the appellant is entitled on well-recognized principles to an order restraining the respondent from the unauthorized use of the appellant's trade names after the licence was revoked, since the continuance thereafter of such user necessarily involves a passing off by the respondent of his business as being a business for the sale of the appellant's goods and as being a business in which the appellant has at least an interest, and in this way there would be practised a deception of the public to the prejudice of the appellant's business reputation and goodwill."

178 Their Lordships went on to consider whether the appellant's conduct had disentitled it to relief, and decided that it had not.

179 In the Supreme Court Irvine CJ and two members of the Full Court (Macfarlan and Mann JJ) thought the licence revocable at will, and that no question of reasonable notice arose. In the High Court Starke J was of the same view. The other members of the High Court did not consider the question. Dixon J said, at 46 CLR 483:
 
 "I agree with the view that the agreement was brought to an end and that it had ceased before the suit was commenced to confer upon the appellant a contractual right or licence to the use of the trade names. I think that, if the agreement had not already ended, it terminated when the winding-up commenced. The arrangement made between the appellant and the Company created a business relation in which the advantages reciprocally enjoyed and conferred depended on each continuing to carry on his or her trade. The shopkeeper for his profit sold with the help of the Company's trade names and methods the goods with which the Company supplied him. The remuneration of the Company for the use of its names and for whatever other service it gave was obtained from the profitable supply of the goods which the shopkeeper sold. Such an arrangement could not survive the termination of the business existence of either party. I do not think that a contractual intention should be imputed to the Company and the appellant to confer upon the appellant a right to the use of the trade names on the termination of the agreement. The parties did not, I think, consider what was to happen if the agreement was brought to an end, and the Company at least meant to do no more than allow its name to be used so long as the shop was a means of selling its goods." 
 

At [110] I have rejected the respondents' submission that the applicants' licence to use the name was revocable at will. Harold and Saul were at liberty to use the Squires Loft name in the City restaurant as long as they wanted to.</text>

<tocase>Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/51.html</AustLII>
<text>187 In Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 417 Brennan J said:
 
 "Where the respective obligations of parties to a contract are mutually dependent and concurrent, the primary rule is that neither party who fails to perform his obligation when the time for performance arrives can rescind for the other party's failure at that time to perform his obligation. Each party's obligation is conditional on performance by the other; neither can complain of non-performance by the other when the condition governing the other's obligation goes unfulfilled. But if one party intimates to the other that it is useless for the other to fulfil his obligation and the other acts on the intimation, the party to whom the intimation is given is dispensed from a nugatory tender of performance."

188 It is common ground that the respondents
 
 &#8226; by their solicitors' letter of 31 March 2005 stated that the respondents would no longer be dealing with the applicants in any capacity
 &#8226; terminated the supplies of sauces and Squires Loft cuts of meat from Top Cut to the applicants
 &#8226; refused to supply any further stationery to them
 &#8226; changed their business cards, menus and marketing material to exclude any reference to the applicants, and
 &#8226; did not have a website operating for October and December 2005, and by their solicitors' letter of 9 November 2005 refused to acknowledge any interest of the applicants in having the website up and running.

189 In these circumstances the respondents have intimated to the applicants that it was useless for them to perform their part of the licence. The prima facie obligation on the applicants to perform their part was thus dispensed with. Accordingly the applicants have not by their conduct evinced an intention not to be bound by the licence. It was not open to the respondents to treat them as if they had, and thereby bring it to an end. The steps taken by the applicants, namely obtaining their own sauces and stationery, were forced on them by the respondents.

193 In my view it was the respondents' solicitors' letter of 31 March 2005 and the ensuing conduct set out at [188] that constituted the breach and activated the principle in Foran v Wight .

194 As at November 2006 Joel did not think that Harold and Saul's right to use the name had terminated as a result of his and Lionel's acceptance of their repudiation of the licence. I refer in this connection to what I have said at [184].

195 In their submissions the parties dealt exhaustively with the name Squires Loft: the applicants claiming an ownership interest and the respondents contending for a mere licence. They also dealt fully with the registration of the name, and what should be done to correct the erroneous impression created by Saul's appearance as its proprietor. Apart from the name, the applicants did not identify the components of "all intellectual property related to the venture". This is doubtless to be explained by the fact that the respondents' case was that they had granted the applicants a licence to use in the City restaurant the name and "the get-up and methodology used by the Respondents in running a restaurant in South Yarra under the name 'Squires Loft'": par 3(b) of the defence. Of course the applicants claimed that the agreement was that the parties would jointly own all intellectual property related to the venture, including the name. However, their fall back position, in the defence to cross-claim, was that if Lionel and Joel had granted them the licence alleged in par 3(b) of the defence, it was for the life of the City restaurant business established pursuant to the licence. The applicants' main case having failed, and the respondents' licence case having succeeded, all that remained for decision was whether the licence of the name and the get up and methodology employed by the respondents in running the South Yarra restaurant was a licence
 
 &#8226; terminable at will
 &#8226; terminable for breach
 &#8226; which came to an end upon the dissolution of the parties' business relationship, or
 &#8226; for the life of the City restaurant. 

I have decided that the licence was not terminable at will, had not been terminated for breach, did not come to an end when the parties fell apart, but was for the life of the City restaurant.</text>

<text>191 The question is whether the 11 March 2005 letter, summarised at [39(pp)], evinces an intention on Harold and Saul's part no longer to be bound by the agreement or to fulfil the agreement only in a manner substantially inconsistent with their obligations and not in any other way: Shevill v Builders Licensing Board [1982] HCA 47 ; (1982) 149 CLR 620 at 625-627 and Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 at 33. The letter was not about any agreement between the parties, whether that asserted by the applicants or the more limited agreement that Harold and Saul could use the Squires Loft name. It was a complaint that Lionel and Joel had engaged in conduct that infringed Saul's trade mark. It demanded that they refrain from dealing with or seeking to licence the mark in relation to the provision by a third party of restaurant or catering services without their consent. It may have been a bold letter written on the dubious basis of Saul's registration of the mark. But it was not a repudiation or renunciation of whatever agreement existed between the parties.</text>

<text>75 Finally, I accept the respondents' submission that in the context of licensing and franchising, business people do not "give away" their intellectual property. The very core of licensing and franchising is the owner's retention of ownership and the grant to the licensee or franchisee of the right to use the property.

76 It follows from what I have said at [61] to [75] that I do not accept the applicants' submission that the Court "can readily find an express agreement upon the common ownership of the 'Squires Loft' name ... in accordance with the evidence of Saul and Harold". Nor do I accept that Lionel and Joel's evidence that Harold and Saul could use the name in the City restaurant for as long as they wished, though there was no agreement that the parties would be joint owners of the name, was "tailored".

77 The applicants also point to various matters that they contend should lead the Court to infer that an agreement in terms of par 3(f) was made. I will assess them one by one, though I will need eventually to view them as a whole.

191 The question is whether the 11 March 2005 letter, summarised at [39(pp)], evinces an intention on Harold and Saul's part no longer to be bound by the agreement or to fulfil the agreement only in a manner substantially inconsistent with their obligations and not in any other way: Shevill v Builders Licensing Board [1982] HCA 47 ; (1982) 149 CLR 620 at 625-627 and Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 at 33. The letter was not about any agreement between the parties, whether that asserted by the applicants or the more limited agreement that Harold and Saul could use the Squires Loft name. It was a complaint that Lionel and Joel had engaged in conduct that infringed Saul's trade mark. It demanded that they refrain from dealing with or seeking to licence the mark in relation to the provision by a third party of restaurant or catering services without their consent. It may have been a bold letter written on the dubious basis of Saul's registration of the mark. But it was not a repudiation or renunciation of whatever agreement existed between the parties.</text>
