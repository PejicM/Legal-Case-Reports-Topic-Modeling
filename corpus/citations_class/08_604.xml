<text>27 After attempting to give evidence from the bar table, Mr Morrison ultimately elected to give oral evidence. An alleged contemnor must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to put before the Court any explanation of his or her evidence and any submissions of fact or law relevant to the charge against him or her or any punishment (see: Coward v Stapleton [1953] HCA 48 ; (1953) 90 CLR 573 ; Doyle v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 46 ; (1985) 156 CLR 510). Although I considered Mr Morrison had been given a reasonable opportunity to put his case before the Court, I allowed him to give evidence because he indicated that there were matters which had only occurred to him during the course of the hearing.</text>

<tocase>Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 201</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/2003/201.html</AustLII>
<text>35 In Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 201 Gillard J identified the elements which it is necessary for a complainant to establish in order to make good a charge of civil contempt of court. His Honour said:
 
 
 "[31] In order to prove a civil contempt of court involving a breach of an order of the court, the plaintiff has to prove the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) that an order was made by the court; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) that the terms of the order are clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) that the order was served on the alleged contemnor or excused in the circumstances, or service dispensed with pursuant to the Rules of Court; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) that the alleged contemnor has knowledge of the terms of the order; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) that the alleged contemnor has breached the terms of the order. 
 
 
 
 
 [32] It is necessary for the plaintiff to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt. In accordance with the principles of the criminal law, in proving element (v) it must be proven that the act or omission which constituted the breach of the order was deliberate and voluntary."</text>

<tocase>Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/3.html</AustLII>
<text>36 As noted by his Honour, the standard of proof required for each of the elements of a charge of contempt of this Court is proof beyond reasonable doubt (see: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534).

37 There is no dispute, and I am satisfied that: 
 
&#8226; Paragraph 1 of the orders I made on 28 September 2007 was an order of the Court. 
 
&#8226; The Order was clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance; 
 
&#8226; The Order was personally served on Mr Morrison on 4 October 2007 and was served on the respondent on 3 October 2007; and 
 
&#8226; Mr Morrison had knowledge of the terms of the Order.</text>

<tocase>Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/46.html</AustLII>
<text>40 In Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said (at 112 113) that: 
 "...lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order, is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court. ... a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual, accidental or unintentional."

41 It is clear that Mr Morrison's affidavit does not, in terms, comply with the Order. A breach of an order will be considered deliberate if it is not found to be casual, accidental or unintentional. The onus remains on the party seeking to prove the contempt to prove that the alleged contemnor's conduct is not casual, accidental or unintentional.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/65.html</AustLII>
<text>38 It was not disputed that the respondent had knowledge of the terms of the Order. On the facts of this case, there can be no doubt that Mr Morrison's mind is the mind of the respondent (see: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 127 referring with approval to Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153). I am, therefore, satisfied that the respondent had knowledge of the terms of the Order.</text>
