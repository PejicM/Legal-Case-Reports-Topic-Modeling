<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1318.html</AustLII>
<text>60 The same conclusion is to be reached by the application of the principles that in certain circumstances the decision of a Tribunal or decision-maker will be vitiated if some inquiry is not made. Most recently, Kenny J examined these cases in her Honour's comprehensive judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318. It can readily accepted, as her Honour said, that there is no general obligation to inquire found in s 424(7), nor is there a general obligation to initiate inquiries or to make an applicant's case for him or her. I refer, without repetition, to the long list of cases referred to by Kenny J in Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] . The absence of such a general obligation of inquiry can be accepted, without denying the limited proposition supported by numerous other cases that, in certain exceptional cases, a failure to make some inquiry may ground a finding of jurisdictional error if it was plainly necessary to make some reasonably straightforward inquiry before the making of the relevant decision: Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-70. Kenny J discusses this in Le at [60]-[67]. I adopt without repetition her Honour's reasons. The only qualification that I would make to her Honour's reasons is that the rubric of Wednesbury unreasonableness may cover circumstances that amount to jurisdictional error and those that amount to error within jurisdiction. It is unnecessary here to explore such possible differences. Here, the failure to take the steps, which in my view were required in the review process, subverted an opportunity to respond to an invitation contemplated or authorised by the statute as part of the review process and so amounted to jurisdictional error.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12</tocase>

<text>33 This (together with the Minister's submissions) was the foundation for the Federal Magistrate saying in his reasons at [27]:
 
 Although the headings on the 25 January 2007 facsimile might have put an alert reader at the Tribunal on notice that not all pages which had been intended to be sent were actually sent, or at least had not been received, the Tribunal is not obliged to make inquiries or to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant choses [sic] not to embark upon: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 22 [42] and [43]; Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. No error is demonstrated by the Tribunal not correcting the applicant's adviser's error.

46 In [27] of his reasons, the Federal Magistrate cited two cases in support of his conclusion that there was no duty to inquire: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 [42] - [43] and Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. The first ( SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; 207 ALR 12) was a reference to the reasons of Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed). Their Honours in that case said that the power to obtain evidence under s 427 did not import an element of duty, a position made plain by s 426(3). That was a straightforward recognition that no duty to enquire about evidence arises from the terms of s 427 of the Migration Act . This much can be readily accepted. There are ample Full Court decisions to like effect. In S154 201 ALR 437, Gummow and Heydon JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) said in the context of examining how detailed the questioning of an applicant was required to be said that:
 
 The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant chooses not to embark on. 
 

This reference has nothing to do with the question here.</text>

<text>51 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (referred to by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 at [35] ), the Full Court discussed the content of the obligation in s 425 to invite the applicant to appear. Much of what was said there is relevant to the cognate invitation to comment. Each invitation must be "real and meaningful". The time frame in which this is to be assessed may be open and may depend upon the question posed: compare NAHF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at 364-5 and SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; 128 FCR 553.</text>

<text>51 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (referred to by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 at [35] ), the Full Court discussed the content of the obligation in s 425 to invite the applicant to appear. Much of what was said there is relevant to the cognate invitation to comment. Each invitation must be "real and meaningful". The time frame in which this is to be assessed may be open and may depend upon the question posed: compare NAHF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at 364-5 and SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; 128 FCR 553.</text>

<tocase>Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>60 The same conclusion is to be reached by the application of the principles that in certain circumstances the decision of a Tribunal or decision-maker will be vitiated if some inquiry is not made. Most recently, Kenny J examined these cases in her Honour's comprehensive judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318. It can readily accepted, as her Honour said, that there is no general obligation to inquire found in s 424(7), nor is there a general obligation to initiate inquiries or to make an applicant's case for him or her. I refer, without repetition, to the long list of cases referred to by Kenny J in Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] . The absence of such a general obligation of inquiry can be accepted, without denying the limited proposition supported by numerous other cases that, in certain exceptional cases, a failure to make some inquiry may ground a finding of jurisdictional error if it was plainly necessary to make some reasonably straightforward inquiry before the making of the relevant decision: Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-70. Kenny J discusses this in Le at [60]-[67]. I adopt without repetition her Honour's reasons. The only qualification that I would make to her Honour's reasons is that the rubric of Wednesbury unreasonableness may cover circumstances that amount to jurisdictional error and those that amount to error within jurisdiction. It is unnecessary here to explore such possible differences. Here, the failure to take the steps, which in my view were required in the review process, subverted an opportunity to respond to an invitation contemplated or authorised by the statute as part of the review process and so amounted to jurisdictional error.</text>

58 This inquisitorial function has become relevant in a number of contexts. In Applicant S 217 CLR at 413 [76] McHugh J said:
 
 If the Tribunal had considered the issue that it was legally required to consider, it was open to the Tribunal to investigate whether such a perception existed, whether within the Afghan society or some section of it, or objectively. Indeed, arguably in the context of its inquisitorial process, the Tribunal had a duty to seek evidence concerning this vital matter.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/22.html</AustLII>
<text>47 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Miah (2001) 206 CLR at 69 [31], Gleeson CJ and Hayne J emphasised that in considering a legislative scheme or context and any particular kind of power within it: 
 
 It is necessary to pay regard to the practical context in which the decision maker must consider whether to exercise the power. This may be of particular importance where, as here, the complaint is of a failure by the decision-maker to communicate something to an affected person before a decision is made. It is the potential for a decision to affect rights, interests, or legitimate expectations, that attracts the requirement of procedural fairness.

48 The step that is said to have been required to have been taken here was to communicate with the representatives of the appellant, informing them of an apparently unsuccessful attempt to respond to a letter sent under s 424A. One can describe that as exercising a power. Any step in the administrative process is in one sense the exercise of power. It is more easily and aptly described as the taking of an administrative step within the context of the review process provided for by Part 7 of the Migration Act . Not to take that step or not to exercise that power was, in practical terms, to deny the appellant the invitation that he had apparently taken-up to respond to the letter of 18 January. Given that it was apparent that the response had not been received, through human or machine error, a failure to exercise the power or take the step had the consequence of ensuring that the response, which s 424A , or the actions of the Tribunal, contemplated was not received.

49 The Migration Act , s 424 provides for the Tribunal "getting" information that it considers relevant. Section 424(1) says that if the Tribunal gets such information, it must have regard to it. Section 424A contains the well-known obligation to send a letter giving the applicant particulars of relevant information and inviting the applicant to comment. Section 424B requires the invitation to specify how the comments may be given. Section 424C(2) empowers the Tribunal to make a decision if the comments are not given within time " without taking any further action to obtain the applicant's views on the information. " It is implicit in Division 4 of Part 7 that the Tribunal must read and have regard to any response to an invitation to comment sent pursuant to s 424A. No express provision states as much, but Parliament did not need to. It would undoubtedly be wrong of the Tribunal to say that it may well have received the envelope containing the response, but it was not obliged to open it and read the contents, because it had no obligation to inquire. Such an obligation (together with one to have regard to the contents) inheres within Part 7 and the undertaking of the review process. The Tribunal is conducting a review by reference to the material before it. Here, the material before it was a document which, on its face, clearly stated that a response was provided, but evidently, through some oversight or error, human or machine, it had not been transmitted.

57 These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process: Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154 201 ALR at 450-451 [57]-[58], 455-6 [81], 457 [86] and [88]; Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69-70 [31] - [32] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 [29] - [31] ; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 648 [208] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 at 513 [97]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at 146 [52] ; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; NCSC v News Corporation Limited [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 315; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2006) 204 CLR 82 at [75] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 195 ALR 1 at 8; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 405, [78] ; Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [39] ; VEAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 24; Re Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387 at 413 [76] ; NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [22] ; SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at [4] ; SZBEL 228 CLR 592 at [40]; SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 at [30] ; Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 540-41 [71] , 526 [18] and 531 [37]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [111] ff and [199]; NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [9] , [69] and [165].</text>

<tocase>Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437</tocase>
<text>33 This (together with the Minister's submissions) was the foundation for the Federal Magistrate saying in his reasons at [27]:
 
 Although the headings on the 25 January 2007 facsimile might have put an alert reader at the Tribunal on notice that not all pages which had been intended to be sent were actually sent, or at least had not been received, the Tribunal is not obliged to make inquiries or to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant choses [sic] not to embark upon: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 22 [42] and [43]; Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. No error is demonstrated by the Tribunal not correcting the applicant's adviser's error.

46 In [27] of his reasons, the Federal Magistrate cited two cases in support of his conclusion that there was no duty to inquire: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 [42] - [43] and Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 451 [58]. The first ( SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; 207 ALR 12) was a reference to the reasons of Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed). Their Honours in that case said that the power to obtain evidence under s 427 did not import an element of duty, a position made plain by s 426(3). That was a straightforward recognition that no duty to enquire about evidence arises from the terms of s 427 of the Migration Act . This much can be readily accepted. There are ample Full Court decisions to like effect. In S154 201 ALR 437, Gummow and Heydon JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) said in the context of examining how detailed the questioning of an applicant was required to be said that:
 
 The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant chooses not to embark on. 
 

This reference has nothing to do with the question here.

57 These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process: Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154 201 ALR at 450-451 [57]-[58], 455-6 [81], 457 [86] and [88]; Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69-70 [31] - [32] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 [29] - [31] ; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 648 [208] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 at 513 [97]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at 146 [52] ; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; NCSC v News Corporation Limited [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 315; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2006) 204 CLR 82 at [75] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 195 ALR 1 at 8; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 405, [78] ; Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [39] ; VEAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 24; Re Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387 at 413 [76] ; NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [22] ; SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at [4] ; SZBEL 228 CLR 592 at [40]; SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 at [30] ; Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 540-41 [71] , 526 [18] and 531 [37]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [111] ff and [199]; NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [9] , [69] and [165].</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>52 It does not seem to me to matter whether a letter was required to be sent by s 424A or not. If s 424A required the letter to be sent (see in particular SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152 and the sixth piece of information to be commented upon) a statutory obligation arose under ss 424A , 424B and 424C to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment. If the letter was not required by s 424A , nevertheless the Tribunal thought it was, and sent a letter to the appellant through his advisers requesting comment upon certain matters. Though purportedly sent under s 424A , it may simply have been sent under s 424 , or merely as part of the exercise of executive power. In either case, the Tribunal having stated that it would receive a response was bound to give a real and meaningful opportunity to respond: see for example s 424(1).

53 On either basis, the obligation of the Tribunal to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment carried with it the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation, where not to take such steps would undermine or subvert the meaningfulness or the reality of the invitation. That obligation involves such mundane things as opening letters, reading them once opened and taking at least basic simple steps that would be taken in any well-run commercial, professional or governmental office, conformable with the recognition of the importance of the response to the invitation to the rights of the applicant and the review process contained within Part 7 of the Migration Act . This does not rest on some posited duty of inquiry. It is not engaging in steps that require for their enforcement some express statutory power. The letter that was received, on its face, told any person who read it that there was with it, or supposedly with it, a five page document which was a response to the relevant invitation. On the facts found by the Federal Magistrate, the five page document was not enclosed. The response was an important document. It must have been, or should have been, apparent that an error (human or machine) had occurred. Whether or not someone did or did not read the coversheet and appreciate this is not determinative. It is clear that someone read at least the second paragraph. The first paragraph (immediately above the second paragraph) in its terms said (together with the express statement above it that there was a " coversheet + 5 pages ") that the response was forwarded when, on this hypothesis, it was not. Whether or not this letter was given to the Tribunal member or not, the Tribunal had notice, in clear plain English, that the appellant (through his advisers) had attempted (unsuccessfully) to respond to the invitation and that something (by way of human or machine error) had gone wrong. This was plain from the English language used on the coversheet. The fact that a person or persons at the Tribunal may not have so understood the coversheet (if that be the case) does not matter. Notwithstanding the submission of Mr Roberts SC, the coversheet was not ambiguous. The present tense was used. It stated that there were five pages with it. On the findings of the Federal Magistrate, there were not. The Minister cannot hide behind the Tribunal not reading, or not reading carefully enough, such an important communication. To do so is itself to undermine the reality and meaningfulness of the invitation to comment that the Tribunal itself had given. A hint of the approach or administrative mindset that led to no step being taken to ring Playfair about the apparently missing five pages can be seen in Mr Willoughby-Thomas' evidence in cross-examination. Although he had no personal knowledge of the events the subject of the application and this appeal, he stated the following in the exchange with the applicant in cross-examination in the extract was that referred to earlier: 
 
 They may or may not have rung, but, receiving hundreds of these faxes, often they are, generally, printed off and placed on the file for consideration by the members.

54 It is not good enough to say that the Tribunal gets lots of faxes. This was an important document. It was apparently a coversheet to a response to an invitation to comment. Reading it made clear that what had apparently been intended to be sent had not been received. The obligation to give an invitation to comment, and separately or cumulatively, the giving of an invitation to comment carried with it, as I have said, an obligation of the kind that I have expressed to enable that invitation to be meaningful and real: that is the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps of at least a simple character to permit or facilitate the fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation. That started with the obligation to read the communication. It extended to ringing Playfair at the identified number to tell them the five pages apparently intended to be sent had not come through.

57 These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process: Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154 201 ALR at 450-451 [57]-[58], 455-6 [81], 457 [86] and [88]; Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69-70 [31] - [32] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 [29] - [31] ; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 648 [208] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 at 513 [97]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at 146 [52] ; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; NCSC v News Corporation Limited [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 315; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2006) 204 CLR 82 at [75] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 195 ALR 1 at 8; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 405, [78] ; Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [39] ; VEAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 24; Re Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387 at 413 [76] ; NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [22] ; SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at [4] ; SZBEL 228 CLR 592 at [40]; SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 at [30] ; Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 540-41 [71] , 526 [18] and 531 [37]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [111] ff and [199]; NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [9] , [69] and [165].</text>

<text>51 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (referred to by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 at [35] ), the Full Court discussed the content of the obligation in s 425 to invite the applicant to appear. Much of what was said there is relevant to the cognate invitation to comment. Each invitation must be "real and meaningful". The time frame in which this is to be assessed may be open and may depend upon the question posed: compare NAHF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at 364-5 and SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; 128 FCR 553.

57 These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process: Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154 201 ALR at 450-451 [57]-[58], 455-6 [81], 457 [86] and [88]; Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69-70 [31] - [32] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 [29] - [31] ; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 648 [208] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 at 513 [97]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at 146 [52] ; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; NCSC v News Corporation Limited [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 315; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2006) 204 CLR 82 at [75] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 195 ALR 1 at 8; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 405, [78] ; Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [39] ; VEAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 24; Re Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387 at 413 [76] ; NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [22] ; SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at [4] ; SZBEL 228 CLR 592 at [40]; SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 at [30] ; Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 540-41 [71] , 526 [18] and 531 [37]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [111] ff and [199]; NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 223 ALR 171 at [9] , [69] and [165].

59 Here, the question was not whether the Tribunal should have undertaken some evidence gathering task. The failure here was to take a simple administrative step of an office or housekeeping nature, the failure to take which could be seen on its face at the time to subvert the observance of the Tribunal of its obligation to give procedural fairness by the giving of the s 424A letter, or by the operation of s 424, or by the general executive power. Division 4 of Part 7 is the statutory formulation of the giving of natural justice: see s 422B. Given the importance of procedural fairness for the principles of jurisdictional error sourced in s 75(v) of the Constitution : see SZFDE [2007] HCA 55 at [32] , any subversion of the process of the Tribunal is a matter of importance: SZFDE [2007] HCA 55 at [32] .</text>
