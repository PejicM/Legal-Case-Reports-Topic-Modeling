<text>1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the appellant a protection visa. The nature of the appellant's visa application, the reasoning of the Tribunal and the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court are set out in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate, which is available on the internet: SZIBP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 404.

2 The appellant is a citizen of China. He arrived in Australia on 15 April 2001 on a student visa, valid until 15 March 2004. After the expiry of his visa he took no further steps to remain in Australia lawfully. On 22 June 2005 he was detained in immigration detention by the Department. Shortly after detention he applied for a protection visa.

3 The appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution in China because he was a Falun Gong practitioner. He claimed to have started practising Falun Gong two years prior to the ban in 1999. He claimed to have practised twice a week in a park. After the ban, his father paid a fine, and later a bribe to the Public Security Bureau so that the appellant would not be arrested. He continued to practise Falun Gong at the homes of members. He claimed in his protection visa application that "then things became really bad". His father organised a student visa for him and he went to Australia. He claimed that after he left China, the PSB came to his house and asked his father to write a confession which implicated the appellant's family in the escape of a Falun Gong member. The confession was then used to extort money from the appellant's family and restrictions were placed on his father's business. The appellant feared that he would be detained and threatened by the PSB on his return to China.</text>

<text>7 The grounds in the notice of appeal in this Court can be summarised as: first: the Tribunal's decision was a jurisdictional error; secondly: the Tribunal's decision involved a procedural error constituting a breach of natural justice; thirdly: the Federal Magistrate did not give sufficient consideration to whether the Tribunal afforded the appellant natural justice, namely whether the Tribunal applied the correct test of persecution under the Convention. The fourth ground is simply a restatement of the test of jurisdictional error from Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163. The fifth ground was:
 
 "Regarding to other issues raised from the Tribunal's decision, it is obviously ill-founded without any substantial evidences excepting it is erroneous findings based. It is poor knowledge and understanding about membership of a particular social group activities as a Falun-Gong practitioner and organization in China."

8 The appellant filed written submissions which summarised the history of his visa application and asserted matters relating to his alleged connection with Falun Gong. The only part dealing with the merits of the appeal were as follows: 
 
 The Tribunal's findings about the commitment to Falun Gong, it did not deal with the question presented by section 36(2) of the Migration Act did Australia owe protection obligations to me? That is, the Tribunal did not correctly apply the law to the facts. In the preceding circumstances, the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction by not asking me the correct questions. That is, the Tribunal was required to consider what might happen to me if I openly practised Falun Gong. Elsewhere, the Tribunal found that "the full facts are yet to be established" as to whether operatives from the Chinese government had knowledge about my Falun Gong activities in Australia. In the preceding circumstances, it is submitted that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction and committed a jurisdictional error of law by not acting judicially in accordance with the requirements of the Act.

9 The appellant attended the appeal. He was not legally represented, but was assisted by an interpreter. When invited to address the court orally, he had nothing to say.</text>
