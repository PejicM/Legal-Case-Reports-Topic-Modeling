<tocase>Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton &amp; Co [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 657</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/51.html</AustLII>
<text>43 Of particular importance in this case is the use by Darrell Lea of darker shades of purple in the packaging of its seasonal chocolate products at Christmas in the years 2000-2004. Darrell Lea used a purple and bronze copper theme in association with Darrell Lea signage and brand usage. The purple is like that used by Cadbury. It is distinct from the lighter shade boysenberry. This was the only evidence isolating a specific decision by Darrell Lea to use purple. If this decision were made with the intention of misleading consumers into thinking that Darrell Lea products were associated with Cadbury, that would be strong evidence that such misleading in fact occurred: Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton &amp; Co [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 657.

44 The primary evidence as to this matter was given by Ms Anne McGlinchey who is currently an independent marketing and retail consultant but worked for Darrell Lea and an associated company from 1989 to 2003. In particular from January 2000, after returning from maternity leave, she was Darrell Lea's Marketing Manager until she left the company in October 2003.

45 When Ms McGlinchey commenced her duties as Marketing Manager she reported to Mr Bruce Goldman the then General Manager of Retail and Marketing. At the time she believed that the Darrell Lea shops looked "tired and dowdy and needed to be freshened and updated". There were too many different colours used, products were too difficult to find and the store layout was not clear. Each store presented its own range of in-store gifts which differed not only from one store to another but also within stores.

51 While Ms McGlinchey did not have the power to make the ultimate decision on colour choice, she was a key figure in the process and on her unchallenged evidence the genesis of the idea for the Christmas 2000 colour scheme was hers. Darrell Lea also called Ms Hurst, who took over Ms McGlinchey's position, and Mr Michael Lea, one of the two directors of the company and who has had a lifetime's experience in its business. Mr Jason Lea, Mr Michael Lea's cousin, who was a director at the time of the 2000 Christmas planning, has recently died. If one accepts Ms McGlinchey, Ms Ettia and Ms Hurst, as I do, as truthful and reliable witnesses, it just seems inherently unlikely that Mr Goldman or Mr Tolmie would have harboured, unbeknowns to Ms McGlinchey, Ms Ettia and Ms Hurst, a secret purpose to misappropriate Cadbury's business by deliberately misleading consumers. As Walton makes clear, this would be the act of a dishonest trader. An allegation of such a kind falls to be assessed in the light of the rule in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>50 Mr Goldman and the Managing Director at the time Mr Ian Tolmie were not called and are apparently available (in Sydney) but I do not think Cadbury gains any assistance from the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. In Heydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Australian ed, 2004 at 41 the learned author says:
 
 "...while the rule in Jones v Dunkel permits an inference that the untendered evidence would not have helped the party who failed to tender it, and entitles the trier of fact to take that into account in deciding whether to accept any particular evidence which relates to a matter on which the absent witness could have spoken, and the more readily to draw any inference fairly to be drawn from the other evidence by reason of the opponent being able to prove the contrary had the party chosen to give or call evidence, the rule does not permit an inference that the untendered evidence would in fact have been damaging to the party not tendering it. The rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence, or to convert conjecture and suspicion into evidence." 


And as the learned author had earlier said (at 39) in formulating the basic rule, failure to call a witness " may , not must, in appropriate circumstances , lead to the inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted that party's case" (emphasis added).</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 364</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/364.html</AustLII>
<text>69 Cadbury tendered (over the objection of Darrell Lea: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 364) a "Chocolate Sensory Study" consumer research report commissioned by it in August 2005 and conducted in October 2005 by Ms Caroline Shelton of National Field Services. The research methodology was provided by a firm called QBrand Consulting after consultation with Professor Roger Layton, Emeritus Professor of Marketing at the University of New South Wales.

70 Although by this time the trial date had already been fixed and the survey was obviously conducted for the purpose of the trial, Cadbury did not comply with Practice Note No 11, issued by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court in 1994, which provides:
 
 "11. Survey evidence 
 
 There are many problems in obtaining acceptable survey evidence including the use of relevant and unambiguous questions and whether the actual conduct of the survey (including methodology) is satisfactory. 
 
 The admissibility of surveys is always a matter for the trial Judge to determine but the risk of the survey being rejected or given little, if any, weight at the trial may be diminished if the following procedure when a party seeks to have a survey conducted. Subject to other directions of the Court in the particular case, the Court expects that this practice will usually be followed: 
 
 1. Notice should be given in writing by the party seeking to have the survey conducted to the other parties to the proceeding. 
 
 2. The notice should give an outline of 
 
 
 a. the purpose of the proposed survey; 
 b. the issue to which it is to be directed; 
 c. the proposed form and methodology; 
 d. the particular questions that will be asked; 
 
 
 e. the introductory statements or instructions that will be given to the persons conducting the survey; 
 
 
 f. other controls to be used in the interrogation process. 
 
 
 
 3. The parties should attempt to resolve any disagreement concerning the manner in which the survey is to be conducted and any of the matters mentioned in 2 above. 
 
 4. The matter of the survey should be raised with the Court at the directions hearing as soon as possible after the steps mentioned above have been taken." 


No explanation was proffered for this non-compliance, which was obviously a deliberate choice by Cadbury and its advisors.

71 Ms Shelton arranged for 102 participants to attend at her firm's premises. They were selected at random from the Melbourne Telephone Directory. Seventy-one per cent were female. They were screened to exclude, amongst other things, people who did not buy chocolate at all or who bought an excessive amount of chocolate. Participants were shown different forms of chocolate (blocks, Easter eggs etc) in batches with wrappings in different colours, one colour for each batch blue, gold, purple, red and green. In fact, all chocolate was from Cadbury, although there was nothing to indicate that to participants.</text>

<text>80 Neither the Trade Practices Act provisions, nor the tort of passing off, require, as an essential element of proof, evidence of actual misleading of consumers. Nevertheless such evidence is admissible and in appropriate circumstances can be "very material" and of "some importance": Royal Warrant Holders' Association v Edward Deane &amp; Beal Ltd [1912] 1 Ch 10 at 14-15, cited with approval by Gummow J, with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed, in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 389. In the present case, it would be useful to have had evidence such as: 
 
 "I usually buy Cadbury chocolate. I know their chocolate from the purple wrappings and advertising. I saw some purple wrapped chocolate but when I got to the checkout I saw it was Darrell Lea's. But I was in a hurry so I bought it anyway."

<tocase>BP plc v Woolworths Ltd (2005) 212 ALR 79</tocase>
<text>82 An essential part of Cadbury's case is that the shade of purple it uses, considered in isolation, distinguishes Cadbury from its competitors. In other words, the colour purple in the context of chocolate has a secondary meaning as an identifier of Cadbury chocolate products. Reference was made to a trade mark case BP plc v Woolworths Ltd (2005) 212 ALR 79 where Finkelstein J held that a shade of green could be registered as a trade mark for BP because customers identified BP service stations by the colour green alone (the Full Court has recently granted leave to appeal: Woolworths Ltd v BP plc [2006] FCAFC 5).</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v The Pub Squash Co Ltd [1981] RPC 429 at 460-461</tocase>
<text>83 This is purely a question of fact. Thus in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v The Pub Squash Co Ltd [1981] RPC 429 at 460-461 Powell J, in a judgment upheld by the Privy Council, held that although the plaintiff's soft drink "Solo" in a lemon coloured can had achieved a level of recognition and acceptance, it did not follow that the proprietor of "Solo" thereby became entitled to a monopoly in yellow coloured cans or that the mere fact the defendant adopted a yellow can for its product dictated a finding of passing off. In other words, it may not be enough that a particular colour is associated in the mind of consumers with a particular product. In the present case, purple may prompt in the reasonable consumers' mind a remembrance that purple has been associated with Cadbury chocolate, but not necessarily the conclusion that the purple packaged product presented for sale to him or her therefore must be Cadbury's.

84 In the present case Cadbury's own evidence (see [18] above) speaks of the elements in the "brand architecture": the name Cadbury, the colour purple, the glass and a half device etc. The architectural metaphor is apt. The architecture of a building involves the whole, not just one component such as a roof or wall. Cadbury's marketing shows how the name Cadbury and the colour purple are inextricably intertwined, with each one reinforcing the other and creating a total impact more than the sum of the parts. This is particularly striking in the late 1990s commercials which had not only extensive use of purple but the repetitive mantra "Cadbury is chocolate is Cadbury is chocolate". In any case, since Cadbury is without doubt one of the most well, and favourably, known names in all consumer marketing, and dominates the field of chocolate in Australia, it would be irrational in the extreme for Cadbury not to make the maximum use of the name.

85 In cross-examination Mr Nowicki was pressed to think of an example where the colour purple alone would be used for Cadbury with no indicia of branding such as the Cadbury name and the glass and a half device. There was a noticeable pause, perhaps upwards of half a minute. Eventually Mr Nowicki gave as an example the television show "Dancing with the Stars" on Channel 7 which he said 
 
 "integrated into that show is specific uses of the colour purple as brand indicia in areas that the production company would not enable us to use other elements of our branding." 


He was asked:
 
 
 "There's two indicia used, the show is brought to you by Cadbury and in the background is the is the purple colour?... No, within the show specifically, within the production itself there are components independently where we only use purple." 
 


Mr Nowicki had previously said that the "show itself is brought to you by Cadbury". No program of "Dancing with the Stars" was in evidence, but if Cadbury were paying substantial amounts to sponsor a high-rating television show it is inconceivable that the name Cadbury would not be transmitted aurally and visually to viewers, even if some elements of the show, such as sets and costumes, contained only purple. If all that viewers saw in a program about dancing was some use of purple, why should they think of chocolate at all, let alone Cadbury chocolate? I am not satisfied that "Dancing with the Stars" is a true example of the purple colour alone used without the name Cadbury.

86 Shortly after that passage of evidence there was a mid-morning break. Upon resumption, Mr Nowicki volunteered that he had thought of another example where purple alone was used. The example he gave was the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games where the Queen's baton was purple as part of the Cadbury marketing plan associated with the event. This would have been a transient use, in the most literal sense.

87 I conclude that, for all practical purposes, Cadbury's use of the colour purple in marketing, promotion, advertising, packaging, and point of sale is always associated with the famous name Cadbury. What Cadbury said in its final submissions as to marketing and sponsorship activities (triathlons, Sydney Olympics etc) is true generally of Cadbury in the marketplace:
 
 "Each of these activities involve the use of Cadbury purple in connection with 'Cadbury'."</text>

<text>117 Although s 52 provides the public with a wider protection from deception than the common law of passing off ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 208), there is a considerable overlap between the two causes of action. In the present case neither side sought to draw any significant distinction between them. Realistically there is no basis on which Cadbury could succeed under the Trade Practices Act but fail on passing off, or vice versa.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>118 Since it is common ground that Darrell Lea products in fact have no sponsorship, approval or connection with Cadbury or its products, and that Darrell Lea's business is entirely unconnected with that of Cadbury, the critical issues in this case relate to the representations that, in all the circumstances, Darrell Lea by its conduct would convey to a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable member of the class constituted by prospective purchasers of chocolate products: Campomar v Sociedad Limitadav Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [102] - [105] .

119 In focusing on the representation alleged to be made by Darrell Lea it is important to keep in mind the consistent rejection by courts of the highest authority of any generalized notion of unfair trading. Attention must be confined to the statutory causes of action and the common law tort of passing off. (The present case is not concerned with the unconscionability sections of the Trade Practices Act .) In Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor (1937) 58 CLR 579 at 508 Dixon J said that in "British jurisdictions" courts of equity have not
 
 "thrown at the protection of an injunction around all intangible elements of value, that is, value in exchange, which may flow from the exercise by an individual of his powers or resources whether in the organization of a business or undertaking or the use of ingenuity, knowledge, skill or labor. This is sufficiently evidenced by the history of the law of copyright and by the fact that the exclusive right to invention, trademarks, designs, trade name and reputation are dealt with in English law as special heads of protected interests and not under a wide generalization." 
 

That passage was endorsed by the High Court in Moorgate Tobacco Company Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 445 and Campomar at [4].</text>

<tocase>Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7</tocase>
<text>120 In relation to passing off, a statement by Lord Oliver in Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 is valuable not only for its statement of the law but for its reminder that these kinds of cases turn essentially on their own particular facts. His Lordship said:
 
 "Although your Lordships were referred in the course of argument to a large number of reported cases, this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other cases is of any real assistance except analogically. It has been observed more than once that the questions which arise are in general questions of fact. Neither the appellants nor the respondents contend that the principles of law are in any doubt. The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition - no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying get up (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a representation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff's identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff's. For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or, in a quia timert action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff."

121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. They have distinct identities in the market place. Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur.

122 There will be an order that the application be dismissed. Darrell Lea foreshadowed an application for indemnity costs. The question of costs will be adjourned to a date to be fixed. Outlines of submissions are to be filed by Darrell Lea seven days and by Cadbury three days before the adjourned date.
