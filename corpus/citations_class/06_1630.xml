<tocase>Silbermann v CGU Insurance Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 21</tocase>
<text>6 On 27 August 2003, CGU sought orders in the Supreme Court that the proceedings brought by Messrs Greaves, Rich and Silbermann be heard concurrently with the proceedings instituted by ASIC against those individuals. That application was dismissed by Bergin J on 3 September 2003: Silbermann v CGU Insurance Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 21.

8 On 24 September 2004, Bergin J granted leave to Mr Greaves to discontinue the proceedings brought by him against CGU. As a condition of the discontinuance, Mr Greaves was ordered to pay CGU's costs.

9 The proceedings in this Court were commenced by the Trustee on 18 October 2006. CGU's motion has been brought promptly, as is contemplated by Federal Court Rules , O 10A r 5(1).

10 CGU submits that it is in the interests of justice that the proceedings in this Court should be transferred to the Supreme Court. Mr Street SC, who appeared with Mr Romaniuk for CGU, argues that the proceedings in this Court are related to the proceedings brought by Mr Rich and Mr Silbermann against CGU in the Supreme Court. Mr Street points out that the Rich and Silbermann proceedings (as I shall describe them) have progressed to a high level of readiness for hearing, including the filing of evidence and the discovery of documents. Mr Street acknowledges that an order has been made staying the Rich and Silbermann proceedings until the conclusion of the hearing of the civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC against Mr Rich and Mr Silbermann. However, he draws my attention to the fact that CGU opposed the grant of the stay and that, in any event, the stay is likely to come to an end in April 2007, when the hearing of the ASIC proceedings in the Supreme Court is scheduled to be completed.</text>

<tocase>Greaves v CGU Insurance Ltd [2004] NSWSC 912</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/912.html</AustLII>
<text>11 CGU submits that it is in the interests of justice to transfer the proceedings in this Court to the Supreme Court since there is a substantial overlap of factual and legal issues between these proceedings and the Rich and Silbermann proceedings. Mr Street acknowledges that, as yet, no order has been made in the Supreme Court that the Rich and Silbermann proceedings be heard concurrently. However, he points out that Bergin J has indicated that such an order may well be made in the future: see Greaves v CGU Insurance Ltd [2004] NSWSC 912 , at [10]. In any event, Mr Street says that the Supreme Court is plainly the Court that ought to determine whether it is appropriate for all three claims against CGU to be heard together and to make appropriate directions for the purpose of bringing them to hearing.

12 Ms Adamson SC, who appeared with Mr Scruby for the Trustee, disputes that the proceedings in this Court and the Rich and Silbermann proceedings are in truth related. She argues that the terms of the policy specifically provide that each insured is deemed to hold a separate policy with CGU, albeit on the same terms and conditions. This means, so Ms Adamson argues, that the principle that a joint or composite policy can be avoided for fraudulent non-disclosure by one co-insured, even if the other co-insured is not aware of the fraud, has no application.

13 Ms Adamson further submits that the Trustee should not be forced to await the outcome of proceedings or applications in the Supreme Court. Rather, he should be free to pursue the indemnity claim in this Court without the delay that a transfer might occasion.</text>
