<tocase>Cakmak v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 257 ; (2003) 135 FCR 183</tocase>

<text>15 Regulation 1.21 is a definition for the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations, which relates to domestic violence. The effect of Div 1.5 is to institute a mechanical form of proof of domestic violence, a serious allegation, which absolves an applicant from the need to prove domestic violence in the ordinary course. It is therefore appropriate that every element of that mode of proof be satisfied ( Cakmak v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCA 503 at [40] per Gray J, not the subject of comment on dismissal of the appeal in Cakmak v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 257 ; (2003) 135 FCR 183). The specification of a Commonwealth declaration also absolves the decision-maker from having to ascertain whether a statutory declaration meets the requirements of the varied State laws. Perhaps, as a matter of less significance, a single form of declaration exposes a person making a statutory declaration to uniform penalties for a false declaration.

16 The appellant submits that a declaration sworn under State legislation is no less effective or efficacious than a declaration under the Commonwealth Act. In his submission, it has the same effect of imposing on the deponent an awareness of the consequences of a false declaration and the penalties for perjury. That may be the case for awareness but not necessarily for the consequences.

17 The parties referred the Court to reg 1.27 of the Regulations after the hearing, without further comment or submission. That regulation provides that a statutory declaration made under the relevant provisions of Div 1.5 is not admissible in evidence before a court or tribunal otherwise than in an application for judicial review or merits review of a decision to refuse to grant a visa or in a prosecution "under section 11 of the Commonwealth Act" for the making of a false declaration. There is no reference in reg 1.27 to admissibility in prosecutions under relevant State legislation. If State declarations were intended to be included within the meaning of reg 1.21, such a reference would be expected.</text>

<tocase>Energy Resources of Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 120</tocase>
<text>13 In the context of the Act and Div 1.5 of the Regulations, reg 1.21 refers to a statutory declaration "under", in the ordinary sense of ' in accordance with ' ( Macquarie Dictionary , 4 th ed, 2005, 16) or ' pursuant to ' the Commonwealth Act ( Energy Resources of Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 120 at [37] per Lindgren J and the cases there cited), that is a s 8 statutory declaration. The fact that the expression used is "under" rather than "made under" does not mean that statutory declarations made in accordance with legislation other than the Commonwealth Act are or were intended to be included for the purposes of Div 1.5. The appellant contends that Parliament could have stated its intention more explicitly by referring in reg 1.21 to a statutory declaration "made under" or "in a manner prescribed by" the Commonwealth Act. That may be so but it does not mean that the intention was the opposite, to include State declarations.

14 The appellant submits that, if the intention were to specify only Commonwealth declarations in reg 1.21, the intention was not executed. I do not accept that this is so. A statutory declaration under or in accordance with the Commonwealth Act is a Commonwealth declaration which complies with s 8 of the Commonwealth Act.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Ejueyitsi [2007] FCAFC 89</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/89.html</AustLII>
<text>24 For the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations, it was necessary for the appellant to provide a Commonwealth declaration; that is, a statutory declaration in the form prescribed by the Commonwealth Act (s 8). He did not do so. The task of the Tribunal was to determine ' whether the evidence presented to it satisfie [d] the description called for in the delegated legislation ' ( Cakmak 132 FCR 183 at [52] per the Full Court; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Ejueyitsi [2007] FCAFC 89 at [24] ). For the reasons given, the evidence did not satisfy that description. The Federal Magistrate was not in error in finding that the Tribunal had correctly concluded that the appellant had not satisfied the requirements of reg 1.24 of the Regulations in relation to his claims of domestic violence. I agree with Hill J in Morgan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1059 at [11] that the fact that a declaration was not made under the Commonwealth Act but under a Victorian Act means that, were the matter to go back to the Tribunal, the Tribunal would have to find against the appellant for this reason. Such referral is, therefore, futile.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>22 There is no definition of "statutory declaration" in the Act to provide a contrary intention. There is, however, the 1.21 definition in the Regulations. There would be no purpose in defining "statutory declaration" in reg 1.21 merely to include a Commonwealth declaration because that has already been provided for by s 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act and s 7 of the Commonwealth Act ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [71] ).

23 Section 27 applies subject to a contrary intention. A contrary intention is evidenced by the 1.21 definition, which purports to exclude a State declaration. There is no other apparent reason for defining "statutory declaration" in reg 1.21. Accordingly, s 27 does not apply to "statutory declaration" in Div 1.5 to include a State declaration.</text>
