<text>30 Counsel for the applicants referred to a recent decision of the Court concerning s 65A: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Seven Network Limited [2007] FCA 1505. It was delivered on 5 October 2007 (the day that the applicants filed and served their submissions in support of this application). It was submitted that, in this decision, Bennett J at [77] and [80] had placed a different construction upon s 65A to that of French J at [42] and that on the construction of the section adopted in the Seven Network decision, it is arguable that the applicants' case has reasonable prospect of success.

31 However, the judgment in Seven Network does not immediately assist the present applicant. In that case, the necessary elements of s 65A(1)(a)(i) and (iii) which in turn lead to a consideration of s 65A(1)(a)(vi) were not in dispute, [70]. Bennett J was concerned with the inter-relationship between the "matter" in s 65(1)(a) and the "contract, arrangement or understanding" in s 65A(1)(a)(vi).

32 That was not the position in this case. French J concluded that the transmission by a freelance journalist of a news article to a newspaper or other media outlet with whom he or she has a contract to supply such services was not a publication of matter " in connection " with the supply of such services. Thus the necessary element under s 65A(1)(a)(i) was held not to have been made out.

33 Nonetheless I propose to grant leave. Section 65A is an important statutory provision. Its interpretation is not without difficulty. Bennett J said, in Seven Network at [92], that the "drafting of the section is not a model of clarity". I respectfully agree. It has ramifications beyond the protection, if any, available to freelance journalists. Its reach ought to be considered by a Full Court. Although I have accorded the matter little weight, I note that an appeal has been lodged in the Seven Network case. To that extent therefore s 65A will be the subject of reconsideration by a Full Court which may then examine the section as a whole.

34 The construction placed on the provision by French J has considerable force. However in all of the circumstances I am persuaded that there is sufficient doubt in respect to the decision to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court. Certainly, substantial injustice would follow if leave were refused, assuming the decision to be wrong: Decor Corporation and Another Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397.</text>

<text>27 The judgment, whilst interlocutory, is one on points of substance and not merely practice or procedure. A distinction is drawn between these: Yap v Granich &amp; Associates [2001] FCA 1735 at [6] ; Dunstan v Orr [2007] FCA 873 at [6] ; see also Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 147 at [39] per Lander J with Moore J concurring. In a case where judgment has the practical effect of finally determining a party's rights, a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal: Ian Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] .</text>
