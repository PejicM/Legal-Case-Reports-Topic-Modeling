<text>There may be circumstances in which the Court may have resort to s 30 to appoint a trustee. For example, where there is a real potential for an appearance of conflict of interest and duty on the part of the trustee, it may be appropriate to appoint an additional trustee to ensure the proper, efficient and cost effective administration of the estate (see Griffin v Triscott (2004) 183 FLR 1). However, that is not this case. If the Act provided no mechanism for the appointment of a new trustee following the death of a registered trustee, it may be appropriate to resort to s 30. Apart from the provisions of s 30, a court of bankruptcy has broad inherent powers to deal with matters arising in its jurisdiction of an administrative kind. The administration in bankruptcy is under the control of the Court, except where it is limited by statute (see Re Brian, Muir v Bradley [2005] FCA 427 ; (1984) 3 FCR 91).

I am not persuaded that the Court has power to make the orders sought by the Official Trustee in the present circumstances. The Act provides a procedure whereby Mr Jones and Mr Condon can be appointed as trustee of the relevant estates. On one view, ss 159 and 160, when read together constitute a code intended to govern exhaustively the filling of the office of trustee when that office becomes vacant (see Re Brian above). Section 181A affords a more streamlined process for replacing a trustee in the manner that I have described. Neither procedure appears to me to be unduly onerous. In having regard to the availability of those procedures, I am not persuaded that it is necessary for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the Act to appoint replacement trustees for the Official Trustee. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to give a direction that the Official Trustee would be justified in taking steps to have a meeting of creditors of the estate convened for the purposes of filling the vacancy occasioned by Mr Watson's death or by initiating the steps contemplated by s 181A. The proceeding should be otherwise dismissed.

Having regard to restrictions on the availability of funds for the Official Trustee, it may be appropriate for the Parliament to give consideration to possible amendment to the Act to deal with circumstances such as have arisen as a consequence of Mr Watson's death. The estates in respect of which the Official Trustee seeks to have Mr Jones appointed have been administered by Mr Jones' office and the estates in respect of which the Official Trustee wishes to have Mr Condon appointed have been administered by Mr Condon's office. That is to say, it is in everybody's interest for Mr Jones and Mr Condon to be appointed trustee of the respective estates in question. The Official Trustee has no connection with those estates. In circumstances where the estates have no funds, a cost effective mechanism for the appointment of a replacement trustee for the Official Trustee may be appropriate. 
 
 I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.
