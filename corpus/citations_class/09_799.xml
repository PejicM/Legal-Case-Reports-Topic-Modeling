<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540</tocase>
<text>A question arises as to whether this later correspondence, which includes correspondence with third parties, and the statements in the autobiography, may be taken into account to determine the question of Ms Sinclair's intention when she submitted the work to the Victorian Girl Guides in 1934: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 at 550 551 per Gleeson CJ.

The question of law which arises in relation to the entry of "Kookaburra" in the competition in 1934 is one of construction of the rules of the competition. The question is whether, in the event that Ms Sinclair's entry was governed by the rules, the rule which provided that all matter entered was to become the property of the Victorian Girl Guides was effective to assign the copyright in the work to that Association. The deeds of assignment of copyright

The remaining issue arises from the assignments of copyright obtained by Larrikin from the Public Trustee and the Libraries Board.

It is true that in XIVth Commonwealth Games at 550 551, Gleeson CJ had regard to subsequent communications between the parties as a factor in determining whether the parties to the alleged contract evidenced an intention to make a concluded bargain.

But that proposition is limited to communications between the actual parties to the alleged contract. His Honour stated that the position is not so clear with respect to internal memoranda or communications with third parties.

Here, most of the communications referred to were between Ms Sinclair and third parties. The documents were contained in a joint tender bundle and were admitted without objection. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that they ought not to have been admitted as evidence.

To admit them would be contrary to the principle stated in Cross on Evidence at [39290] that: 
 
 [T]he parties' subsequent conduct may be relied upon to establish the existence of [the] contract ... 
 

This statement emphasises the fact that it is the communications between the parties themselves which are admissible, rather than statements made by one party to a stranger to the alleged contract.

Even if the evidence of communications with third parties were admissible, it could be given little weight because the communications took place 20 to 40 years after the date on which "Kookaburra" was entered in the competition.</text>

<tocase>Interstate Parcel Express Co Proprietary Limited v Time-Life International (Netherlands) B.V. [1977] HCA 52 ; (1977) 138 CLR 534</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/52.html</AustLII>
<text>First, there is a well-known distinction in the law of copyright between the incorporeal right to the intellectual property, and the right to the physical property in a work: Interstate Parcel Express Co Proprietary Limited v Time-Life International (Netherlands) B.V. [1977] HCA 52 ; (1977) 138 CLR 534 at 550.

It seems to me that the word "matter" is more apt to describe the physical property consisting of the manuscripts rather than the copyright in the works.

Second, there are good practical reasons why the Victorian Girl Guides might have wanted to retain the material object of the works, rather than become a bailee. The works would be likely to have been needed for archiving purposes and the persons conducting the competition would hardly have been likely to want the responsibility of returning the physical manuscripts to the entrants.</text>

<tocase>Lustre Hosiery Limited v York [1935] HCA 71 ; (1935) 54 CLR 134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1935/71.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the recitals to the tripartite Deed were "informal admissions". As was pointed out by J. D. Heydon in Cross on Evidence at [33420], such admissions may always be contradicted or explained by the maker, and it is for the Court to determine on the evidence what weight is to be given to such admissions. This was also made clear by the High Court in Lustre Hosiery Limited v York [1935] HCA 71 ; (1935) 54 CLR 134 where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said at 138 139: 
 
 No doubt an admission made by a party as to the correctness of a fact is admissible in evidence notwithstanding that the party has no direct knowledge of the fact and must rely for his belief upon the statements of others, or upon inferences from circumstances which he knows, or which have been reported to him. But such an admission may indicate a state of mind varying from a firm belief based upon a thorough investigation ... down to a wavering preference for one of two or more possible hypotheses none of which have been tested or determined. It is apparent that the admissibility of the evidence must be distinguished from its sufficiency to establish or support an affirmative conclusion in favour of the party who tenders it, when the burden of proof lies upon that party. It does not follow that, because such evidence is admissible, it is enough to prove the issue.

Here, I accept the evidence of Mr Lurie as to the circumstances in which he signed the Tripartite Deed. It is obvious from the correspondence which preceded the Deed that Larrikin was a stranger to the dispute between the Public Trustee and the Libraries Board as to the ownership of the copyright.

He accepted the Deed in good faith. It was of no moment to him because it provided that Larrikin obtained title through the Libraries Board.</text>

<tocase>Murray v King (1984) 4 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>It is true, as the respondents submitted, that the authorities establish that no particular form of words is necessary to effect an assignment of copyright: see Murray v King (1984) 4 FCR 1 at 7, 13.

However, in my view, this does not overcome the objections that I have listed above. This is because in order for the authorities such as Murray v King to apply, there must be some intention to assign copyright. As I have indicated above, in my view, it cannot be inferred on the evidence that either Ms Sinclair or the Victorian Girl Guides had the intention to effect an assignment of copyright.

In any event, I do not consider that the words in question in the present case are sufficient to disclose, on an objective consideration, an intention to effect an assignment of copyright.

The effect of Mr Catterns' submissions was that, in the Tripartite Deed of 14 March 2000, the Public Trustee and Larrikin admitted that the earlier Deed of Assignment was ineffective.</text>

<tocase>Nominal Defendant v Owens (1978) 22 ALR 128</tocase>
<text>The test is that there must be shown to be more than "conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a mere matter of conjecture": see Nominal Defendant v Owens (1978) 22 ALR 128 at 132, and the authorities there referred to.

Here, in the absence of an entry form or any evidence that Ms Sinclair had knowledge of the terms of the competition on submitting her entry, it is equally probably that Ms Sinclair learned of the existence of the competition without seeing the circular or the rules. She had an active interest in the Victorian Girl Guides' movement and it is equally probable that she learned of the competition through her association with the Movement.

It is also equally probable that there were no formal documents constituting entry forms and that entries were submitted informally, by lodgement of the composition, the entry fee, and details of the entrant's name and address, if not already known to the Victorian Girl Guides.</text>

<tocase>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/32.html</AustLII>
<text>No support can be gained from the well-known "ticket cases" in the law of contract. Those cases establish that where an exemption clause is contained in a ticket, and the other party is not actually aware of the terms of the clause when the contract was made, the party seeking to rely on it cannot do so unless, at the time when the contract was made, reasonable notice was given to the other party: see Seddon and Ellinghaus, Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th Australian Edition, 2008) at [10.28] and [10.70]; Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 228-229.

This principle has no application here, because as the authors of Cheshire and Fifoot observe at [10.71], it is necessary to determine with some precision at what point the contract was made. That cannot be done in the present case.

What the composers and EMI would need to establish is that Ms Sinclair submitted her entry after the publication of the circular or after the July edition of Matilda and that each of those publications constituted reasonable notice.

Having regard to Ms Sinclair's close connection with the Victorian Girl Guides, it is mere conjecture to say that this is what happened. It is equally probable that she heard of the competition by word of mouth and submitted her entry before the publication of those documents.

Accordingly, it has not been established on the evidence that Ms Sinclair entered into a contract in writing on the terms contained in the circular, or, at least, that the contract included the term which provided for all "matter" to be the property of the Victorian Girl Guides. It follows that there was no assignment in writing to satisfy the requirements of s 5(2) of the British Copyright Act .</text>
