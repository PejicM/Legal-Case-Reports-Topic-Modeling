<tocase>Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700</tocase>
<text>The power which is given by that rule was described by Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710-711: 
 
 '... the objects of Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them for mistakes in the conduct of their cases ... I know of no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party ... as soon as it appears that the way in which a party has framed his case will not lead to a decision of the real matter in controversy, it is as much a matter of right on his part to have it corrected, if it can be done without injustice, as anything else in the case is a matter of right.'</text>
