<text>46 Spriggs submitted that the management fee was, as the invoice stated, for " management and promotional services by CSM for season 2004 " and that those services were not identified. I reject that contention. A label is never determinative: Commissioner of Taxation v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) ATC 4659 at 4668; Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 68 ; (1953) 89 CLR 428 ; Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 and Sun Newspapers Ltd &amp; Associated Newspapers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1938) 61 CLR 337. The fee paid by Spriggs to CSM was payment for Connors of CSM negotiating a playing contract with an AFL club. The playing contract facilitated the generation of income of both Football Payments and Additional Services Payments. CSM negotiated each of Spriggs' AFL playing contracts. That is not surprising. Mr Shinners from AFLPA said that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent. Consistent with the terms of the Representation Agreement, Connors from CSM also negotiated the activities that generated or produced all of Spriggs' income from "Additional Services".

66 An examination of the character of the advantage sought is assisted by asking two questions: (1) what was the management fee really paid for? and (2) is what it was really paid for, in truth and in substance, a capital asset?: Colonial Mutual at 454 and Sun Newspapers Ltd at 359-360. The advantage must be identified and characterised. The answer to those questions is not assisted by an analysis of the contractual right or rights secured under the contract, as distinct from the activity itself: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raymor (NSW) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 193 ; (1990) 24 FCR 90 at 99 (per Davies, Gummow and Hill JJ) citing Dixon J in Hallstroms at 648. As Dixon J said in Hallstroms , the answer:
 
 
 "...depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view, rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured, employed or exhausted in the process."

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/21.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289 at [11] to [15], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ described "sport" and "professional sport" in the following terms:
 
 
 
 "11. "Sport" is usually used to describe forms of (more or less) athletic pastime undertaken for pleasure or recreation. In many contexts, it may be used in contradistinction to "business" or "occupation". It is a word that may carry with it echoes of what once was commonly understood to be the Olympic ideal of the amateur pitting skill and strength against others in the pursuit of excellence. It may convey only the idea of a pursuit which is intended to do no more than provide diversion or amusement to both participants and onlookers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12. "Professional sport" may be thought to be a phenomenon of the second half of the 20th century. It was during that century that the expression came to be associated with those who made their principal pursuit the playing of sport for reward. During parts of the 20th century, and even before, distinctions were drawn among cricketers between those who were "gentlemen" and those who were "players", between the professional tennis player and the amateur, between the professional boxer and the amateur, between the golf club professional and the club player. What was understood as marking one group apart from the other was sometimes whether the "professional" was employed by an employer (often a club). But that was not the only basis for the distinction. Distinct codes of sport emerged in rugby football and in boxing, where the rules of the game differed according to whether those participating were professionals or amateurs. Then, as professional golf and tennis circuits developed, the distinction might be thought to have turned upon whether the individual sought to make the playing of the sport a full-time occupation and the principal source of income.
 
 13. The plaintiff in Tolley v J S Fry &amp; Sons Ltd ([1931] AC 333) was a well known amateur golfer. The House of Lords upheld the award by a jury of damages for libel of the plaintiff by reason of the publication in 1928 of an advertisement for the defendants' chocolate in which there appeared a caricature of the plaintiff. The innuendo pleaded by the plaintiff had been that (at 337): 
 
 
 

"[the] defendants meant, and were understood to mean, that the plaintiff had agreed or permitted his portrait to be exhibited for the purpose of the advertisement of the defendants' chocolate; that he had done so for gain and reward; that he had prostituted his reputation as an amateur golf player for advertising purposes, that he was seeking notoriety and gain by the means aforesaid; and that he had been guilty of conduct unworthy of his status as an amateur golfer". 
 

 
 
 
 14. However, the distinctions upon which the pleading in Tolley turned 75 years ag o (See Hopman v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1960) 61 SR (NSW) 631) were never tidy. They never accommodated what probably always was, but certainly emerged as being, the wide variety of circumstances in which some of those participating in sport have received sums of money for, or as a result of, their endeavours on a playing arena. They are distinctions that do not take account of the changing role played by those who have organised sporting competitions. No longer is the organisation of such competitions the preserve, as it once may have been, of the voluntary association or members' club. Now many competitions are conducted for the profit of those who organise them. 
 
 15. Athletic contests for prizes are very old. Classifying a participant in such a contest as "professional" does no more than present the question: What is meant by "professional"? That is why asking no more than whether this taxpayer was a "professional" athlete either restates the relevant question, about whether the receipts in question were "income", in words that distract attention from the content of that relevant question, or it seeks to inject presuppositions into the debate that should not be made. Likewise, when considering whether a person who receives sums for, or in connection with, sport is conducting a business, or exploiting that person's skills or abilities for reward, care must be taken lest presuppositions that should not be made are injected into the debate."
 
 (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 

The highlighted section of the passage is apt to describe the AFL and the players registered to play in the AFL Competition. Paragraph [15] of the passage is a reminder that the term 'professional' should not distract attention from the need for a critical assessment of the activities and income of the taxpayer.

33 Section 8 of the 1997 Act provides, so far as is relevant:
 
 
 
 "(1) You can deduct from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that: 
 
 

(a) it is incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income; or
 
(b) it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.

 
 
 
 (2) However, you cannot deduct a loss or outgoing under this section to the extent that: 
 
 

(a) it is a loss or outgoing of capital, or of a capital nature; or
 
(b) it is a loss or outgoing of a private or domestic nature; or ..."

34 "Business" is defined in s 995-1 of the 1997 Act to include "any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling, but does not include occupation as an employee." "Business" was defined in the same way in s 6(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("the 1936 Act ").

48 The Commissioner did not contend that it was not possible for a professional sportsperson to be carrying on a business of exploiting his or her sporting talent. As the High Court in Stone said (at 307):
 
 
 "The conclusion that the taxpayer was engaged in a business during the 1998-1999 year proceeds from an acceptance of the proposition that, showing that both before and during that year, the taxpayer was paid to endorse a company or its products as an athlete demonstrated that she has turned her athletic talent to account for money." 
 
 
 

Spriggs' position is not distinguishable. He turned his football talent to account for money both before and during the 2005 income year: see [27] [31] above.

49 In fact, the Commissioner did not dispute that CSM sought to negotiate "Additional Services" to be undertaken by Spriggs during the 2005 income year. The Commissioner's contention was that CSM's lack of success " demonstrates that ... Spriggs was not sufficiently marketable to sustain a viable business." That proposition should be rejected. That it seeks to import into the concept of "business", in the absence of an allegation of sham, some requirement of viability, is contrary to established authority on the question of what is a business and what business expenses are deductible. No less importantly, the contention is contrary to the facts.

50 First, the proposition is unworkable. By reference to what standard (financial or otherwise) and at what time would "viability" be determined? The Commissioner identified no standard. In any case, what was not viable about Spriggs' business in the 2005 income year? He received and returned assessable income from both Football Payments and a small amount of money for Additional Services. His income position was positive, not negative.

52 It is to the facts in the present case that I now turn. As noted above, Spriggs turned his football talent to account for money both before and during the 2005 income year. Not only had "trading" commenced, there was in fact a "discernible trading pattern". His business derived substantial income. 2005 was not the best year. It was not the worst. The 2005 income year cannot be looked at in isolation. As the High Court said in Stone (at 305), the fact that other sports and other athletes may have attracted larger rewards is irrelevant.

53 In the 2005 income year, Spriggs was carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing his assessable income. For the reasons outlined above (see [43] to [47]), the management fee was incurred by Spriggs in carrying on that business.

54 The Commissioner contends that all expenditure incurred prior to an employment contract is not deductible. In this case, the Commissioner contends that the management fee was incurred at a point too soon to be an expense incurred in gaining or producing assessable income notwithstanding that:
 
 (1) the management fee was incurred on 20 December 2004; and
 
 (2) the playing contract for the 2005 season was signed on 9 December 2004.

55 The Commissioner's general (not to say universal) contention that all expenditure incurred prior to the playing contract being signed was not deductible because it came "at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income" should be rejected. Of course, as a general proposition, an expense may "come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income". Whether an outgoing does come at a point too soon to satisfy s 8-1(a) of the 1997 Act is determined by reference to the particular facts of each case.</text>

<text>65 The classic test for resolving the distinction between capital and revenue is that stated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd at 363:
 
 
 "There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment."

66 An examination of the character of the advantage sought is assisted by asking two questions: (1) what was the management fee really paid for? and (2) is what it was really paid for, in truth and in substance, a capital asset?: Colonial Mutual at 454 and Sun Newspapers Ltd at 359-360. The advantage must be identified and characterised.

As Dixon J said in Hallstroms , the answer:

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426</tocase>
<text>40 Finally, even if an item of expenditure cannot be traced to a particular item of income that fact of itself does not mean that the expenditure is not deductible: Total Holdings at 224 and the authorities there cited. However, an item of expenditure may not be deductible if it was incurred at a point too soon before the income producing activity commenced or if it was incurred after the income producing activity has ceased: Steele at [44]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426; Riverside Road Lodge at 313; Amalgamated Zinc at 309 and AGC (Advances) at 197-198.

56 The phrase "come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income" was first used by Menzies J in Maddalena . However, that is not what occurred here. The Commissioner's reliance upon Maddalena is misplaced. The case is distinguishable on a number of bases.

57 The management fee was expenditure outlayed within a framework in which Spriggs, as a professional footballer, produced his income. That framework was the AFL Player Rules, the Representation Agreement and the Standard AFL Playing Contract. That framework has to be considered in context including Mr Shinners' evidence that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and that he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent.

58 Moreover, the management fee was not incurred prior to the generation of the income. The income was ongoing. The income that was generated as a result of the negotiations of the Accredited Agent was, in each year (except 2004), from two necessarily related sources. One of those sources was the playing contract. The other was his additional services which he was able to provide only because he was a contracted AFL player. The term of Spriggs' playing contracts varied from between 1 and 2 years. For each year of each of the playing contracts negotiated by Connors of CSM, the Representation Agreement imposed an obligation on Spriggs to pay a percentage of his Football Payments to CSM.

61 Some analogies may or may not be apposite. And argument by analogy must never be allowed to obscure the particularity of the arrangements in question. Maddalena concerned an era of professional sportsmen and women which bears little or no resemblance to professional sport in the twenty first century. One only has to point to the absence of the electronic media, let alone the internet, in the 1930's to make good that proposition. Secondly, the factual matrix in Maddalena is very different to the factual matrix of Spriggs.

62 In Maddalena , Menzies J described the taxpayer and the issue in the following terms (at 548-9):
 
 
 "The question is whether the taxpayer, who earns his living as an electrician and as a professional footballer, is entitled to deductions under s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act [ 1936 (Cth)] of travelling expenses, and under s 51 and 64A of the Act of legal expenses, incurred by him in seeking and obtaining a new contract with a new club to play football.
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 Of course, in his career as a professional footballer, a player who is successful ordinarily moves from grade to grade and from club to club. His employment is part-time and it is common for a player to play football in representative teams as well as with his club ... Furthermore, it is common knowledge that because a man is a successful professional he can earn fees from advertising and other sources which, of course, form part of his assessable income. Nothing I say in this judgment bears upon expenditure to earn such fees. Here it is the agreement with Newtown that the taxpayer spent money to secure." 
 
 
 (Emphasis added.)

63 Spriggs was a full time professional footballer. Maddalena was not. Spriggs seeks to claim the management fee as a deduction. That fee was incurred after the playing contract was signed, not before, and could not be charged if no playing contract was negotiated. Maddalena sought to claim travelling expenses and legal expenses, expenses which were incurred before the playing contract and which were incurred regardless of whether or not a playing contract was secured. The management fee incurred by Spriggs did not " come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income ".

64 In relation to the "negative limb" of s 8-1 of the 1997 Act , the Commissioner submitted that even if the management fee was an outgoing incurred by Spriggs in gaining or producing assessable income, it was on capital, not revenue, account and therefore not deductible under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act . This argument also fails.</text>

39 The phrase "assessable income " refers not to the assessable income of the year in which the expenditure was incurred but to assessable income generally: Steele at [22]; Fletcher at 16 - 17; Ronpibon at 56 (per Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and Webb JJ); Riverside Road Lodge at 311; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 30 ; (1979) 43 FLR 217 at 222 and AGC (Advances) Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1975] HCA 7 ; (1975) 132 CLR 175 at 189 and 196-197.</text>

<text>65 The classic test for resolving the distinction between capital and revenue is that stated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd at 363:
 
 
 "There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment."

<text>46 Spriggs submitted that the management fee was, as the invoice stated, for " management and promotional services by CSM for season 2004 " and that those services were not identified. I reject that contention. A label is never determinative: Commissioner of Taxation v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) ATC 4659 at 4668; Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 68 ; (1953) 89 CLR 428 ; Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 and Sun Newspapers Ltd &amp; Associated Newspapers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1938) 61 CLR 337. The fee paid by Spriggs to CSM was payment for Connors of CSM negotiating a playing contract with an AFL club. The playing contract facilitated the generation of income of both Football Payments and Additional Services Payments. CSM negotiated each of Spriggs' AFL playing contracts. That is not surprising. Mr Shinners from AFLPA said that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent. Consistent with the terms of the Representation Agreement, Connors from CSM also negotiated the activities that generated or produced all of Spriggs' income from "Additional Services".

66 An examination of the character of the advantage sought is assisted by asking two questions: (1) what was the management fee really paid for? and (2) is what it was really paid for, in truth and in substance, a capital asset?: Colonial Mutual at 454 and Sun Newspapers Ltd at 359-360. The advantage must be identified and characterised. The answer to those questions is not assisted by an analysis of the contractual right or rights secured under the contract, as distinct from the activity itself: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raymor (NSW) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 193 ; (1990) 24 FCR 90 at 99 (per Davies, Gummow and Hill JJ) citing Dixon J in Hallstroms at 648. As Dixon J said in Hallstroms , the answer:
 
 
 "...depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view, rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured, employed or exhausted in the process."

<text>36 The first positive limb is directed at expenditure " incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income " (emphasis added). "In" means in the actual course of producing assessable income: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Payne [2001] HCA 3 ; (2001) 202 CLR 93 at 99 (Gleeson CJ, Kirby and Hayne JJ); Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay's) Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1935] HCA 81 ; (1935) 54 CLR 295 at 303 (Latham CJ) and at 309 (Dixon J); W Nevill &amp; Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1937] HCA 9 ; (1937) 56 CLR 290 at 305; and John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1959] HCA 4 ; (1959) 101 CLR 30 at 40.

37 The limb is not confined to circumstances where the income is derived from carrying on a business: Fairfax at 40 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Snowden &amp; Willson Pty Ltd [1958] HCA 23 ; (1958) 99 CLR 431 at 435-6.</text>

<text>51 Secondly, whether or not a person is in business is a question of fact: John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 430. As the High Court went on to say in John :
 
 
 "... in some cases the determination of that fact may depend on questions of impression and degree. If trading has not commenced or if there is no discernible trading pattern, the question of intention or purpose may be relevant in the sense that if there is an absence of intention or purpose to engage in trade regularly, routinely or systematically then the person may well not be a trader."

39 The phrase "assessable income " refers not to the assessable income of the year in which the expenditure was incurred but to assessable income generally: Steele at [22]; Fletcher at 16 - 17; Ronpibon at 56 (per Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and Webb JJ); Riverside Road Lodge at 311; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 30 ; (1979) 43 FLR 217 at 222 and AGC (Advances) Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1975] HCA 7 ; (1975) 132 CLR 175 at 189 and 196-197.

41 The first and second positive limbs overlap. They are not mutually exclusive. As the High Court said in Ronpibon (at 56), " in actual working [the second limb] can add but little to the operation of " the first limb. Three points should be made about the second limb: it operates and only operates to allow deductions of business expenses; the business must be carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income and, as with the first limb, "assessable income" refers to assessable income generally and not the assessable income of a particular income year.</text>
