<text>1 On 10 June 2005 I published reasons for judgment finding that native title can be recognised over the traditional lands of the Bardi and Jawi People on the Dampier Peninsular and in the inter-tidal zone and adjacent reefs Sampi v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 777. On 4 November 2005 I published a draft determination to give effect to those reasons and to deal with some other issues outstanding from the primary judgment Sampi v State of Western Australia (No 2) [2005] FCA 1567.</text>

<text>2 On 30 November 2005 I made a native title determination over the land and waters in which I had found native title to exist. The orders then made expressly excluded, by agreement, certain small freehold areas in respect of which there were ongoing questions not raised at the trial of the action. Those questions were whether they were properly covered by the application and, if so, whether any extinguishment of native title on them could be disregarded because of the operation of s 47A of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) Sampi v State of Western Australia (No 3) [2005] FCA 1716.

3 On 14 December 2005 programming orders were made for the filing of affidavits and written submissions in relation to the existence of native title on the adjourned areas. The adjourned hearing proceeded on 22 May 2006. For reasons I now publish, I am satisfied that the adjourned areas were not included in the native title application the subject of these proceedings. They can therefore not be included in the native title determination. This does not prevent a separate application for a native title determination being brought in respect of the adjourned areas. Having regard to the evidence taken and facts found in the primary proceedings it would seem that the only issue on a new application is likely to be the application of ss 47A and 47B of the Act to those areas.

4 The orders made on 30 November 2005 included the following as Order A: 
 
 'The proceeding stands adjourned by Order of the Court made 25 November 2005 in relation to the following areas which are not included in the Determination Area: 
 
 
 
 (a) those portions of Dampier Location 25 as were comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 1670 Folio 883 when the native title determination application the subject of proceeding WAD 49 of 1998 was made, including Dampier Locations 371, 372, 373, 374, 404 and 405; and 
 (b) the areas comprised in Certificates of Title Volume 1744 Folio 116 (Portion of Dampier Location 19), Volume 1744 Folio 117 (Portion of Dampier Location 69) and Volume 1744 Folio 118 (Dampier Location 21), 
 
 generally shown on the Maps in Schedule 8.' 
 
 

I attach copies of enlargements of the two adjourned areas within the determination area.</text>
