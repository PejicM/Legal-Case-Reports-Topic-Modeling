<text>3 The facts of the case have been set out in an earlier judgment relating to the first four respondents given on 10 January 2008: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Kokos (No 2) [2008] FCA 5. Injunctive orders were made by consent and penalties imposed after argument in respect of those respondents. Declarations offered by consent were stood over pending the finalisation of the proceedings against all respondents. In a further judgment, delivered on 17 January 2008, I made injunctive orders against the fifth and sixth respondents and again imposed penalties. Declaration orders proposed by consent were stood over until the finalisation of the proceedings as a whole: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Kokos International Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 20. The matter has come back before the Court for disposition as against the seventh and eighth respondents. Statements of agreed facts have been filed.</text>
