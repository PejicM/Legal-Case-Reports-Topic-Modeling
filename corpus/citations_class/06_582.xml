<tocase>Lamb v Ariss [2006] FMCA 510</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/510.html</AustLII>
<text>2 On 13 April 2006, the Magistrate discharged the mandatory injunction and related orders on the ground that the applicant's solicitor had failed to act with the requisite candour when seeking an order ex parte: see Lamb v Ariss [2006] FMCA 510 (the Magistrate's reasons).

3 The applicant applies for leave to appeal, if it be required, from the discharge of the mandatory injunction. (A notice of appeal has been filed.) The applicant also moves the Court for a stay of the proceeding before the Magistrate pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.

4 Three issues arise for determination by me:
 
 (a) whether leave to appeal is required;
 (b) if leave is required, whether leave should be granted; and
 (c) if no leave is required or, if leave is required, leave is granted, whether the applicant is entitled to the stay.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1912/72.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The Magistrate's reasons bear repetition to some extent:
 
 
 "31. In my view, it is perfectly clear from a reading of the transcript of the Registrar's examination which took place on 22 December 2005 that the bankrupt had stated a belief that the jewellery was given to her as a gift and, as she described it, "They were mine." But also it is equally clear that she immediately proceeded to say "But but they weren't" and that "They were owned by Sira Properties". Elsewhere in the material, it is clear that the bankrupt confirmed that on the previous occasion when she gave evidence, the evidence was to the effect that the jewellery might be the property of Sira Properties. 
 
 32. Whilst the court is prepared to make due allowance for the fact that when the application was made before this court on 23 December 2005 the transcript of the previous day's examination was not available, the fact remains that both senior counsel and Mr King were present both on 22 December 2005 before the Registrar and before this court upon the hearing of the urgent ex parte application on 23 December 2005." 
 
 
 

The Magistrate then quoted from Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock [1912] HCA 72 ; (1912) 15 CLR 679 at
681-682 and Milcap Publishing Group AB v Coranto Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 34 at 36. He went on to say:
 
 
 40. In my view, the making of ex parte orders by any court is a significant and serious process to be undertaken, and it should be undertaken with due care. Applying [Thomas A Edison] to the present case, it is clear in my view having regard to a comparison between the first King affidavit [(ie the affidavit described at [8])] and in particular paragraph 11 thereof [(ie the paragraph where what is set out in the first sentence at [8](g) appears)] and the limited extract of the evidence of the bankrupt that the court was not at the ex parte hearing provided with all the evidence which was then known to either the deponent and/or his client , and indeed counsel who appeared both before this court and the s.81 examination. 
 
 41. For a bankrupt's evidence to be limited in the way it is sought to be limited in the first King affidavit, in my view can only result in the court being misled. It is the responsibility of parties seeking to make an ex parte application, to bring to the notice of the court all facts material to the determination of the right to that order and I accept that it is no excuse for any party to indicate that he or she was not aware of the importance of the material. 
 
 42. As indicated by the High Court in [Thomas A Edison], uberrima fides is required. If a party induces a court to act in the absence of another party, and in doing so fails in its obligation, in my view, to paraphrase the words of the High Court, unless he supplies the place of the absent party to the extent of bringing forward all the material facts which that party would presumably have brought forward in his defence to that application. 
 
 43. It seems logical to me and irresistible that if the bankrupt or indeed if the First Respondent had been present upon the hearing of the application by this court on 23 December 2005, then the complete extract of the bankrupt's evidence would have been referred to along with other extracts during the course of the examination before the Registrar, indicating that a concession was made by the bankrupt that the jewellery was owned by the Second Respondent, even though the bankrupt believed the jewellery had been a gift and that it belonged to her or, to use her words, was "mine". 
 ... 
 48. The decision to proceed on an ex parte basis is a significant decision which should not be regarded as a decision to be taken lightly by legal practitioners. In this instance, the proceedings commenced arguably on the wrong form, failed to seek substantive relief, and more significantly relied upon what I find to be inadequate and misleading affidavit evidence in relation to the full extent of the evidence given concerning a crucial issue of significance to the court's deliberation, based upon the bankruptcy evidence of the previous day's section 81 examination. 
 
 49. Having embarked upon the ex parte urgent application, then the Applicant does so at the Applicant's peril. The duty to act with utmost good faith is a significant duty, and for the reasons stated I am satisfied in this instance that that duty has not been discharged. In my view it follows that the orders made by the court on 23 December 2005 should therefore be discharged. 
 
 50. That leaves the question of whether the court should in the circumstances grant leave to the Applicant to now amend the [FMCA] application retrospectively, to replicate the orders sought as interim orders in that part of the [FMCA] application referring to final orders. In my view, in the exercise of the discretion, whilst the court from a practical point of view may be tempted to permit the amendment, it would seem to be unfair and contrary to the interests of justice to permit an Applicant who has failed to exercise the utmost good faith in bringing an ex parte application to then convert that application, flawed as it clearly has been found to be, to an application for substantive relief. In my view the proper course is to refuse the application to amend and to simply dismiss the [FMCA] application and otherwise discharge the orders made by the court on 23 December 2005." 
 
 
 

(The emphasis is mine.)

26 The applicant also contended that the Magistrate erred when he said at para 40 of his reasons (see the second passage quoted at [12]) that "the court was not ... provided with all the evidence which was then known to either the deponent and/or his client". (The emphasis is mine.) His Honour posited and said he would apply the tests found in Thomas A Edison and Milcap Publishing . A fair reading of his reasons discloses that, notwithstanding the language of para 40, the Magistrate correctly applied those tests. At para 35, his Honour said that the respondents had contended that a comparison between Mr King's affidavit and the transcript of the bankrupt's second examination showed that the court "was clearly misled in relation to what could be described as a crucial issue" leading to the granting of the mandatory injunction. The "crucial issue" to which his Honour referred is that highlighted at [23]: that the bankrupt had conceded that she did not own the jewellery in question. The Magistrate's reference to "all the evidence" was a reference to all the evidence going to the "crucial issue". The comparison shows that the concession was not disclosed by Mr King's affidavit. The Magistrate's reference to "all the evidence then known " (emphasis added) shows that the Magistrate was engaging in the comparison. That is further shown by his statements that the material before him on 23 December 2005 was:
 
 &#8226; "incomplete and ... had the effect of misleading the court in relation to the true state of the evidence which had been given by the bankrupt on the previous day " (para 44); and
 &#8226; "inadequate and misleading ... in relation to the full extent of the evidence given concerning a crucial issue of significance to the court's deliberation , based upon the ... evidence of the previous day's ... examination " (para 48). 

(The emphases are mine.) Further, the Magistrate said at para 43 that:
 
 "It seems logical to me and irresistible that if the bankrupt or indeed if the First Respondent had been present upon the hearing of the application by this court on 23 December 2005, then the complete extract of the bankrupt's evidence would have been referred to along with other extracts during the course of the examination before the Registrar, indicating that a concession was made by the bankrupt that the jewellery was owned by the Second Respondent, even though the bankrupt believed the jewellery had been a gift and that it belonged to her or, to use her words, was 'mine'." 
 

In each of the two paras preceding the one I have just quoted, the Magistrate said that the obligation of a party seeking an order ex parte was to bring forward all material facts. Clearly, the Magistrate was of the opinion that all material evidence on the crucial issue equated with all the evidence on the crucial issue. He was correct in that opinion.</text>

(The emphasis is mine.)

24 In Milcap Publishing , Davies J said at 35:
 
 "When an ex parte order is sought, the person seeking the order must be frank and disclose to the court all the matters which, if put before the court, might have an effect upon the court's decision. The facts that should be disclosed go both to matters of liability and matters of discretion. If a fact is material in that it would be a matter to be taken into account by a court in the making of the decision to grant an injunction or in the formulation of an order that is to be made, it is a matter that ought to be disclosed." 
 

(The emphasis is mine.) I think it clear that that test has been satisfied. A reasonable person in the Magistrate's position would have taken into account what the bankrupt was in fact saying at her second examination in deciding whether or not to grant the mandatory injunction. Undoubtedly, that information might have affected that decision.

25 The applicant contended that the Court should apply the test in Re South Downs Packers . In that case, Connolly J said at 566 that "[a] non-disclosure will not be material unless it be likely to influence the court in acceding to the application". (The emphasis is mine.) Though I prefer to follow Milcap Publishing as it is a decision of this Court, the application of the test in Re South Downs Packers would not lead to a different result.

26 The applicant also contended that the Magistrate erred when he said at para 40 of his reasons (see the second passage quoted at [12]) that "the court was not ... provided with all the evidence which was then known to either the deponent and/or his client". (The emphasis is mine.) His Honour posited and said he would apply the tests found in Thomas A Edison and Milcap Publishing . A fair reading of his reasons discloses that, notwithstanding the language of para 40, the Magistrate correctly applied those tests. At para 35, his Honour said that the respondents had contended that a comparison between Mr King's affidavit and the transcript of the bankrupt's second examination showed that the court "was clearly misled in relation to what could be described as a crucial issue" leading to the granting of the mandatory injunction. The "crucial issue" to which his Honour referred is that highlighted at [23]: that the bankrupt had conceded that she did not own the jewellery in question. The Magistrate's reference to "all the evidence" was a reference to all the evidence going to the "crucial issue". The comparison shows that the concession was not disclosed by Mr King's affidavit. The Magistrate's reference to "all the evidence then known " (emphasis added) shows that the Magistrate was engaging in the comparison. That is further shown by his statements that the material before him on 23 December 2005 was:
 
 &#8226; "incomplete and ... had the effect of misleading the court in relation to the true state of the evidence which had been given by the bankrupt on the previous day " (para 44); and
 &#8226; "inadequate and misleading ... in relation to the full extent of the evidence given concerning a crucial issue of significance to the court's deliberation , based upon the ... evidence of the previous day's ... examination " (para 48). 

(The emphases are mine.) Further, the Magistrate said at para 43 that:
 
 "It seems logical to me and irresistible that if the bankrupt or indeed if the First Respondent had been present upon the hearing of the application by this court on 23 December 2005, then the complete extract of the bankrupt's evidence would have been referred to along with other extracts during the course of the examination before the Registrar, indicating that a concession was made by the bankrupt that the jewellery was owned by the Second Respondent, even though the bankrupt believed the jewellery had been a gift and that it belonged to her or, to use her words, was 'mine'." 
 

In each of the two paras preceding the one I have just quoted, the Magistrate said that the obligation of a party seeking an order ex parte was to bring forward all material facts. Clearly, the Magistrate was of the opinion that all material evidence on the crucial issue equated with all the evidence on the crucial issue. He was correct in that opinion.</text>

<tocase>City of Camberwell v Camberwell Shopping Centre Pty Ltd [1994] 1 VR 163</tocase>
<text>19 Further, the fact that the Magistrate determined that there should be an assessment of damages to be paid pursuant to the undertaking does not support the contention that leave is not required. The applicant relied on the decision of the Full Court in City of Camberwell v Camberwell Shopping Centre Pty Ltd [1994] 1 VR 163 at 173-175 as authority for that proposition. I cannot see how City of Camberwell can be so relied upon. In that case, the trial judge, by agreement with the parties, decided liability before assessing damages. He decided that the defendant was indeed liable to the plaintiff. Though he did not make orders to that effect, a "judgment" that "the issues of liability raised by the [defendant] are not to be resolved in favour of the [defendant] and it is appropriate therefore to turn to the issues between the parties as to damages" was authenticated. Marks and Gobbo JJ (Fullagar J dissenting) said at 174-175 that:
 
 "The circumstances are, in our opinion, analogous to those in Hall [v Busst [1960] HCA 84 ; (1960) 104 CLR 206] and such that it may fairly be said that the determination of the learned [trial] judge was intended as a judgment for [the plaintiff] for damages to be assessed and that therefore it is final, if not, a determination as to liability to pay damages which is final. Thus the appeal is as of right from 'a determination' within the meaning of s 10(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic)." 
 

Needless to say, the circumstances in this case are quite different to those in City of Camberwell . Further, the assessment of damages in this case results not from a decision on the merits as to liability (as in City of Camberwell ) but automatically upon the discharge of the mandatory injunction which was granted upon the giving of the undertaking.</text>

<tocase>D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<text>20 The question whether leave to appeal should be granted falls to be determined according to the criteria set down by the Full Court in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397. First, whether the impugned decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. Secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the impugned decision was wrong.

21 The applicant, by his submissions, contends that:
 
 
 "9. ... The proposition that [the second respondent] and/or Mr Ariss could have been expected to contend for, if present before the [Federal Magistrates] Court, namely, that they or one of them was the true owner of the jewellery, was clearly articulated as was the basis upon which they might seek to rely to establish such a claim: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) there was express disclosure that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; 
 (b) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt gave evidence that when she asked her husband (ie, Mr Ariss) for the jewellery, he said the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] and that she could not have it; 
 (c) there was express disclosure that when the husband had been examined pursuant to s81 of the Bankruptcy Act , he asserted that he had given certain items of the jewellery to one or both of this daughters, consistent with ownership of the jewellery by him or [the second respondent]; 
 (d) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt expressed the opinion that some of the house contents, the subject of the same policy of insurance, might be owned by [the second respondent] although, like the jewellery, such items of contents were not disclosed as an asset in the balance sheet of [the second respondent]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. In order to determine whether or not there was 'material' 
 non-disclosure, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence of the bankrupt as a whole. It is asserted that the fact she had earlier given evidence contrary to the proposition the jewellery was hers was not disclosed. What the transcript of the evidence given by the bankrupt on 22 December 2005 discloses is that she did on occasion give contrary evidence. That is, on occasion she gave evidence that she thought that the jewellery was either that of Mr Ariss or [the second respondent]. However, what is critical is that she was examined as to why she might hold to that view. She said in evidence that she held that view for two reasons, namely: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) because those persons were named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; and 
 (b) her husband had told her that the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] or of himself. 
 
 
 
 
 Both considerations which had led [the bankrupt] to on occasion state that the jewellery might be the property of [the second respondent] or of Mr Ariss were disclosed on the ex parte application, as was the fact there was evidence consistent with such potential claims. 
 
 
 
 
 
 11. The cases establish that, on an application made ex parte, there must be disclosure of material facts. The material facts which were required to be disclosed here were: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons who were named as persons having an insured interest in relation to the jewellery. This was disclosed in the King ... affidavit and the relevant insurance documents were exhibited; 
 (b) that Mr Ariss, currently the sole director of [the second respondent], held the view that the jewellery in question was either his or [the second respondent's]. This was also disclosed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12. The best evidence that Mr Ariss and/or [the second respondent] would claim to be the owners of the jewellery, and the basis of that claim, was before the Federal Magistrates Court. There was direct evidence, of which the Court was informed, that Mr Ariss asserted the jewellery was his or [the second respondent's] and, on that basis, refused to return it to his wife. In those circumstances, the fact there was additional evidence from the bankrupt that, on the basis of the insureds' interest and on the basis of what her husband told her, she believed that the jewellery may be his or [the second respondent's] jewellery, was not material. ... 
 ... 
 17. The King ... affidavit disclosed that [the second respondent] or Mr Ariss would assert an entitlement to the jewellery. The ... Magistrate knew that was the case they would make and knew there was documentary evidence in support of that case, at least as to an arguable insurable interest, notwithstanding none of the jewellery appeared on the balance sheet of [the second respondent]."

28 The Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. I do not think it necessary to go on to consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the Magistrate's decision was wrong. The two limbs of the test in D&eacute;cor Corporation cannot be considered in isolation from one another: see D&eacute;cor Corporation at 398-399. The prospect that an appeal, if leave were granted, would be successful is so remote that it would be artificial to suppose that the decision below is wrong.

<tocase>Re South Downs Packers Pty Ltd [1984] 2 Qd R 559</tocase>
<text>22 The proposition in the first sentence of para 11 in the passage quoted at [21] is correct. A party seeking an order ex parte must disclose all material facts. However, as Campbell CJ said in Re South Downs Packers Pty Ltd [1984] 2 Qd R 559 (Full Court) at 560:
 
 "What is material in any case depends, in the first instance, upon the nature of the case sought to be made out and, to that end, must be viewed in the context of all the relevant circumstances."

23 The applicant has taken far too narrow a view of what constituted material facts that should have been disclosed to the Magistrate. His submissions quoted at [21] are, to a large extent, beside the point. A reasonable person in the Magistrate's position who had the benefit of the transcript of the bankrupt's second examination (or an accurate summary thereof) would readily discern that the bankrupt was saying that though she did not own the jewellery in question, and that it was owned by the second respondent , she thought she was "emotionally" or, indeed, morally entitled to it. Mr King's affidavit did not disclose this to the Magistrate. That was a serious omission for an affidavit that purported to give an accurate account of the evidence given by the bankrupt at her second examination. Nor was that omission rectified before the Magistrate.

25 The applicant contended that the Court should apply the test in Re South Downs Packers . In that case, Connolly J said at 566 that "[a] non-disclosure will not be material unless it be likely to influence the court in acceding to the application". (The emphasis is mine.) Though I prefer to follow Milcap Publishing as it is a decision of this Court, the application of the test in Re South Downs Packers would not lead to a different result.</text>

<text>27 Finally, the notice of appeal referred to at [3] says that the Magistrate erred in "failing to have regard to, or to apply, the decision in Re Bayliss (1987) 15 FCR 167 to which he was referred, to the case before him". Though the applicant's submissions mention Re Bayliss , the applicant's counsel did not mention it before me. In any case, I cannot see how Re Bayliss could have advanced the applicant's case as it stands for a proposition of a highly general nature. I can see no circumstance in this case that makes that proposition of especial significance.</text>
