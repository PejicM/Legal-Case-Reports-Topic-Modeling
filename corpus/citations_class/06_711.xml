<tocase>Alterskye v Scott [1948] 1 All ER 469</tocase>
<text>2 Early cases, such as Richardson v Hastings (1884) 7 Beav 354 and Reynolds v Godlee (1858) 4 K &amp; J 88, state that discovery may be refused unless the party gives an undertaking that the documents would not be used for any purpose other than the action then proceeding. The principle was stated in Bray on Discovery (1 st ed, 1885) at 238: "A party who has obtained access to his adversary's documents under an order for production has no right to make their contents public or communicate them to any stranger to the suit ... nor to use them or copies of them for any collateral object ... If necessary an undertaking to that effect will be made a condition of granting an order ...". An express undertaking is not now required. It is to be implied in every case: Alterskye v Scott [1948] 1 All ER 469. The modern statement of the rule is to be found in Harman v Secretary of State, Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280.</text>
