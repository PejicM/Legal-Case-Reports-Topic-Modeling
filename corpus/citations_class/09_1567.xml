<text>In this case, I am satisfied having regard to the affidavit of Ms Kelly Gardner and the matters deposed to by Mr Grigson, that a prima facie case or serious question to be tried is made out on the substantive question for the purposes of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 (particularly at [65] to [72]). Having regard to that matter, I am satisfied that an injunction order ought to be made directed to the first respondent. The affidavit of Ms Gardner also deposes to a conversation she had with the first respondent in which the first respondent confirmed his address for receipt of particular material and said that he had signed and would return straightaway a form effecting a forfeiture of the particular articles. That did not occur.

The conversation suggests plainly an inference that the respondent accepts that the goods are counterfeit goods. The notice in question is a Notice of Consent to Forfeit Goods under Part 13 the Trade Marks Act . Being satisfied of those matters and particularly having regard to the paragraphs of Ms Gardner's affidavit, namely, paragraphs 30 to 33, taken in conjunction with paragraph 3, I am satisfied that although only two of the articles are the subject of the counterfeit analysis by her, an inference arises that if two of the articles, depicted in the material, are established as counterfeit articles, then the remaining eight articles making up the bundle of 10 articles the subject of the notice, would also be likely to be counterfeit articles.

Being satisfied of those matters, it is appropriate to make an order restraining the first respondent in terms of the proposed interlocutory injunction. Since the articles are demonstrated on the material, at least at the standard of a serious question to be tried or prima facie case, to be counterfeit articles, it seems to me that the status quo ought to be preserved by making an order directed to the Customs CEO not to release the counterfeit articles into the hands of the designated owner. I am satisfied that in light of the serious question to be tried, an order ought to be made under s 137(5) , both having regard to its intersection with s 136(1) and its context within Part 13 more generally and the circumstances to be determined in the proceedings.</text>
