<text>26 The discretion to order security for costs is a very broad one: Lucas v Yorke (1983) 50 ALR 228. The authorities have identified a number of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion. I refer, by way of example, to the discussion by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 196-198, French J in Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 at [28] , Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 and Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 ; (2006) 155 FCR 181 at 183-186 [7] - [12] .</text>

<tocase>Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>35 As to the fourth matter, the applicant has not established that the litigation will be stifled if an order for security for costs is made. The onus is on it to do so: Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1. While it has been established that it will not be able to pay the respondents' costs if they are successful in their defence it has not been established that those who stand behind the applicant cannot provide security. As I have said, no evidence as to the financial position of Mr Stewart has been put before me.

36 As to the fifth and sixth matters, in view of the order which I have made, it is not necessary for me to say anything more about those factors.

37 As to the seventh matter, it is not relevant here.</text>

<tocase>Clarence Street v ISIS Projects Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 380</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2007/380.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In this case the first matter, namely, the delay in bringing the application is a very significant matter. There is no doubt the respondents were aware of the Court's power to make an order for security for costs and, indeed, they raised the issue with the applicant's former solicitor in March 2006 and with the applicant's present solicitor in October 2006. The applicant's financial statements could have been obtained by the respondents from October 2006. The application for security was not brought until less than two weeks before the first adjusted trial date. The fact that that trial date has now been changed to 13 August 2007 is relevant but, in the end, I do not think that it detracts in any significant way from the importance to be attached to the respondents' delay. The respondents submit that any delay on their part cannot be decisive of their application and, in fact, in the absence of prejudice, is of minimal significance. They referred to Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunter J, 7 November 1995); Clarence Street v ISIS Projects Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 380. In Clarence St , McDougall J said (at [22]):
 
 "The authorities, I think, on a proper analysis also make it plain that delay is not to be looked at in the abstract. What is important is whether, assuming that delay has been shown, such delay causes actual prejudice to the party against whom the order is sought. Even if prejudice is shown, the application need not fail; but unless it is shown, the significance of delay as a countervailing factor disappears. See the decision of Hunter J in Hughes Bros Pty Limited v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney (7 November 1995, unreported; BC 95079079)."</text>

<tocase>Clyde Industries Ltd v Ryad Engineering Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACLC 325</tocase>
<text>31 In my opinion, it would cause prejudice to the applicant and be quite unfair to it to make an order for security for costs by way of a cash deposit or bank guarantee at this late stage. To my mind, that is a sufficient reason to refuse the application insofar as it seeks security of that nature. However, having regard to the matters outlined below, it does not stand in the way of an order that the party who will benefit from the proceeding if it is successful, Nicholas Jules Stewart, be required to provide a personal guarantee whereby he guarantees the payment of any costs the applicant is ordered to pay the respondents and incurred by the respondents on or after 5 July 2007. I realise that I have conducted no inquiry into Mr Stewart's financial position and his ability to meet a costs order, but I do not think that that means that such a guarantee cannot constitute a form of security: Clyde Industries Ltd v Ryad Engineering Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACLC 325 at 328 per Rowland J (see also the discussion in Dal Pont at 964-965 [29.28]-[29.29]). In any event, if such a guarantee is worthless, that would be a reason to refuse an order for security for costs because the proceedings would otherwise be stifled.

32 My conclusions have been reached not only in the context of the delay, but also having regard to the other factors which I turn now to address.

33 As to the second matter referred to in [27], I am satisfied that the applicant's claim is bona fide. However, I am not prepared to go any further than that because there are a number of contested issues and, in those circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits of the applicant's claim.</text>

<text>14 I will not recite the details of all the interlocutory steps taken in the proceedings. However, two should be mentioned. On 4 April 2007 I refused an application by the applicant for summary judgment on part of its claim: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489. In May 2007 I dealt with an application by the respondents for a stay or dismissal of the proceedings by reason of non-compliance by the applicant with various orders of the Court. The details of the application are set out in my reasons on a question of costs: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903.</text>

<tocase>Jodast Pty Ltd v A &amp; J Blattner Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 248</tocase>
<text>1 This is an application by the respondents by notice of motion for an order for security for costs. The application is brought pursuant to s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) or s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), or both. There is no dispute that it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd, the applicant in the proceedings, will be unable to pay the respondents' costs if they are successful in their defence. In those circumstances, similar factors are relevant to whether an order for security for costs should be made whether the application be considered under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) or s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): Jodast Pty Ltd v A &amp; J Blattner Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 248 per Hill J.

2 The respondents seek an order that the applicant provide security for their costs by way of a bank guarantee in the sum of $250,000. They seek an order that if the security is not provided, the applicant's proceeding should be stayed or dismissed. The respondents have brought a cross-claim against the applicant but, on the hearing of their notice of motion, they have indicated that if security is granted they will not pursue the cross-claim.

3 
 
On 16 July 2007 I made the following order:
 
 "Nicholas Jules Stuart [sic] on or before 23 July 2007 provide a personal guarantee to the respondents whereby he guarantees the payment of any costs the applicant is ordered to pay the respondents and incurred by the respondents on or after 5 July 2007 up to a sum of $200,000.00."
 

My reasons for making that order follow.</text>
