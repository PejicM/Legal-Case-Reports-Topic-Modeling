<tocase>Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another [2003] FCAFC 223 ; (2003) 130 FCR 279</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/223.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 94(1) of the EMDG Act provides that the provisions of subsection (2) thereof apply if the requirements specified in ss 94(1)(a) and 94(1)(b) are satisfied. The fulfilment of the requirements in s 94(1)(b)(ii) is conditional upon the satisfaction of the CEO of Austrade, and such satisfaction is to be determined by the application of the Guidelines. Once a determination has been made that the requirements are met, s 94(2) then directs Austrade to treat the particulars of the previous owner as being those of the applicant. Such determination requires a judgment to be made by the CEO of Austrade. As was observed in Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another [2003] FCAFC 223 ; (2003) 130 FCR 279 at [40] of a decision making process: ' [t] his intellectual process involves matters of judgment and degree' . That is, a decision is required.

In the application of both s 94(1)(b)(i) and (ii) a value judgment must be made by the decision-maker. Under s 94(1)(b)(i) a decision is required to be made in respect of the question whether the new owner is carrying on the old business or a part thereof. It follows that there has been a decision made by Austrade in respect of which an appeal may lie to this Court pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act.

Accordingly, the Court rejects the submission that the requirements of s 94(1) constitute jurisdictional facts, and that s 94(1)(b)(i) is capable of determination by objective facts.</text>

<tocase>Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515</tocase>
<text>In Comcare v Etheridge and Others [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 527 the Full Court considered the nature of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and determined that an appeal 'on a question of law' is narrower than an appeal 'that merely involves a question of law' . The Court at 527 referred to the observations in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 38 AAR 55 which expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 where his Honour said: 
 If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like "erred in law" or "was open as a matter of law" can make it into a question of law.</text>

<text>The Court concludes that, since no factual questions are involved in such determination, the question as submitted is one solely of law 'directing the Court's attention to the manner in which the Tribunal failed to discharge its obligations according to law...' : see Collins v Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Another [2007] FCAFC 111 ; (2007) 163 FCR 35 at [55] .</text>

<text>In Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission and Another [2000] HCA 5 ; (1999) 199 CLR 135 at [28] the High Court of Australia observed: 
 The term "jurisdictional fact" (which may be a complex of elements) is often used to identify that criterion, satisfaction of which enlivens the power of the decision-maker to exercise a discretion.</text>

<tocase>Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1465</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/43.html</AustLII>
<text>In Gedeon v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1465 at [43] the High Court said: 
 The expression "jurisdictional fact" was used somewhat loosely in the course of submissions. Generally the expression is used to identify a criterion the satisfaction of which enlivens the exercise of the statutory power or discretion in question. If the criterion be not satisfied then the decision purportedly made in exercise of the power or discretion will have been made without the necessary statutory authority required of the decision maker.</text>
