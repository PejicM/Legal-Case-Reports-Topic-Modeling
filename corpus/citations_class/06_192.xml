<tocase>Bishop v Bridgelands Securities Ltd (1990) ATPR SS41 -060</tocase>
<text>26 In fact, in Bishop v Bridgelands Securities Ltd (1990) ATPR SS41 -060 Wilcox J held that para (b) was not limited by reference to para (a) of r 2. I respectfully agree. Nonetheless, the first inquiry will always be whether the terms of para (a) are satisfied. If so, the Court will proceed to consider discretionary factors of the kind mentioned above. If not, the Court may still be persuaded in the particular circumstances of the case to exercise the discretion by granting leave, as happened in Bishop v Bridgelands, above.

27 Mr Knight could not have joined S &amp; S and Wiley at the outset because the facts giving rise to his claims against them (the publishing of the two books) occurred subsequently.

28 If a separate proceeding were brought by Mr Knight against S &amp; S and Wiley, it appears that some common questions of law and fact would arise in that proceeding and the present proceeding (see para (i) of r 2(a)), namely, questions relating to Mr Knight's reputation in Australia in connection with the name 'MYTHBUSTERS'. Apparently this will be a strongly contested issue in this proceeding. It may be, however, that even in relation to this issue, there would be differences between the two proceedings, one proceeding relating to Mr Knight's reputation with television viewers and the other relating to his reputation with the buyers and readers of books.</text>

<tocase>Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/39.html</AustLII>
<text>29 The rights to relief claimed in the two proceedings would clearly not be 'in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions': cf Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609. The evidentiary fields which would be covered by Mr Knight's claim against Beyond, Discovery, SBS and Foxtel in connection with the television series, and that covered by his claim against S &amp; S and Wiley in connection with publication of the two books, would, it seems, be quite different.

30 The inconvenience to the two groups of respondents of having to participate in a hearing in which a substantial number of the issues and a substantial part of the evidence would be no concern of theirs, must be weighed against the inconvenience to Mr Knight of having to prove his reputation (or reputations) in separate proceedings.

31 In my view, the weighing exercise favours the respondents. Mr Knight would not have been entitled under O 6 r 2 to join the publishers as respondents in this proceeding initially, and he should not be allowed to do so now.</text>
