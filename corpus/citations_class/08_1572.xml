<tocase>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223</tocase>
<text>44 CEMEX challenges the orders made by the Panel on grounds that may be summarised as follows:
 
 
 
 1. The orders were not authorised by s 657D , as that provision: 
 
 

 (a) did not authorise the Panel to order a person to pay an amount of money to another person, either at all or, alternatively, in the absence of satisfaction that the latter person has suffered loss or damage as a result of the circumstances declared to be unacceptable; and
 
 (b) did not authorise the Panel to delegate to ASIC the duty to decide whether a person must pay an amount of money to another person.
 
 
 
 2. the Panel improperly exercised the power conferred by s 657D by: 
 
 

 (a) failing to take into account relevant considerations, being whether CEMEX's conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Act; whether any Affected Shareholder relied on or suffered loss as a result of any conduct on the part of CEMEX; and whether the takeover bid would have proceeded differently, if the unacceptable circumstances had not occurred; and
 
 (b) making a decision in the context of the absence of evidence concerning the extent to which the rights or interests of Affected Shareholders were actually affected by the unacceptable circumstances, that being unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.
 
 3. The Panel erred in law within the meaning of s 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act in various respects, arising out of the above grounds, including by concluding that an order could be made to "protect" rights or interests which no longer existed at the time the orders were made.

45 These grounds raise three issues: (1) whether the Panel had power to order CEMEX to pay each Affected Shareholder $0.25 in respect of each share sold during the Relevant Period in the absence of a finding that each Affected Shareholder had suffered a loss; (2) whether the orders involved an impermissible delegation of power to ASIC; and (3) whether the orders invalidly attempted to "protect" rights or interests that no longer existed.

46 The essence of this complaint is that s 657D(2)(a) while the Panel is authorised to make orders that protect rights or interests affected by the unacceptable circumstances, it is not given power to order that payment be made to individuals who have not shown financial loss. Consequently, where there is no evidence before the Panel that any individual Rinker shareholder suffered financial loss as a result of CEMEX's conduct order for payment is beyond power. The absence of such evidence meant the Panel was not in a position to determine whether there was a "reasonable connection between the extent to which the right/interest has been affected and the extent to which it is sought to be protected". As CEMEX stated in its written submissions:
 In the absence of such evidence, the Panel lacked the ability to determine whether any person's rights or interests had been affected and whether any order made by it would "protect" the shareholders' rights/interests. This is because individual shareholders may have suffered no loss or may have suffered a loss lesser or greater than the final dividend.

56 It follows that CEMEX's argument that the Panel improperly failed to take into account whether their conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B or 6C of the Corporations Act must be rejected. It also follows from my findings that the Panel's orders cannot be said to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense; Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223.

57 CEMEX alleges that the orders involve an impermissible delegation of power in that they establish, by orders 14-16, a mechanism by which ASIC is given the power to determine authoritatively whether a person is an Affected Shareholder and is therefore entitled to the payment. The mechanism set up by orders 14-16 is as follows:
 
 
 14. CEMEX may refer a claim to ASIC, within 2 weeks of CEMEX or the ISP receiving the claim form (whichever is earlier). CEMEX must provide to ASIC, with the referred claim form, the reasons it considers that the person submitting the claim form may not be entitled to the payment set out in the claim form because: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) CEMEX considers that the person submitting the claim form is not an Affected Shareholder;
 (b) Special Circumstances do not apply;
 (c) CEMEX dispute some or all of the details, supporting documents or evidence submitted in all with the claim form; or
 (d) CEMEX considers that payments have already been made or claimed for in respect of some or all of the Rinker shares claimed for. 
 
 
 
 
 15. If CEMEX refers a claim form to ASIC under Order 14, ASIC shall within 2 weeks of receipt of that claim form make a determination, after consultation with CEMEX if ASIC considers it desirable, as to whether or not the person submitting the claim form is entitled to be paid in accordance with the Orders and if necessary, for how many Rinker shares.
 16. If ASIC is unable to make a determination under Order 15, it shall refer the claim form to the Panel within 2 weeks of receipt by ASIC of that claim form for decision.

58 According to CEMEX, where the power to determine authoritatively whether a person falls within the group is delegated to a third party it is not possible for the review Panel to reach the requisite state of satisfaction that the rights or interests of a group of person have been affected.</text>

<tocase>Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd [2008] HCA 2 ; (2008) 242 ALR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/2.html</AustLII>
<text>24 It may well be that the Panel's concern to make quite clear that it was not basing its decision on a finding that there had been a contravention of the Corporations Act was because its decision predated the decision of the High Court in Attorney-General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd [2008] HCA 2 ; (2008) 242 ALR 1. At the time, therefore, the question of whether s 657A(2)(b) involved the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth had not been authoritatively determined.

25 The review Panel rejected CEMEX's submission that the terms of its best and final offer should be construed as retaining for CEMEX a discretion whether or not it would deduct the amount of the dividend paid to Rinker shareholders or that it had qualified its 10 April announcement by reserving such a discretion. It referred to analysts' reports submitted by CEMEX and found that of the seven reports submitted, only one expressed the view that CEMEX could allow Rinker shareholders to retain the benefit of the final dividend, two expressed a contrary view and the others did not address the matter.

26 The review Panel also referred to the statement made by Rinker on 27 April 2007, when it announced the final dividend of $0.25. The Rinker announcement said:
 Shareholders should note that under the terms of CEMEX's takeover offer for Rinker, CEMEX has the right to deduct the amount of the dividend (or an amount equal to its value, as are reasonably assessed by CEMEX) from the offer price payable to accepting shareholders who have or will receive that dividend. 
The Panel considered that the "ordinary reading of the statement" would merely remind shareholders of the terms of CEMEX's offer and would not convey the meaning that CEMEX might improve its offer, by allowing them to retain a dividend.

38 The regulatory framework which Chapter 6 establishes is, as Gleeson CJ observed in Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd at 4, designed "to preserve an efficient, competitive and informed capital market". Section 657A(1) recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with such a market even where it does not contravene a specific provision of the Corporations Act . Emmett J recognised this in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at 108:
 The panel, of course, is expressly empowered by s 657A(1) to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act. Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch 6. It is clear enough that the regime involving the panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Ch 6: ... The panel made its declaration because, notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act, the purposes of Ch 6, as expressed in s 602 , were not achieved. That is precisely the circumstance for which s 657A provides. It is not unreasonable for the panel, if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised, to reach that conclusion.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Yandal Gold Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ASCR 317</tocase>
<text>65 In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Yandal Gold Pty Ltd (1999) 32 ASCR 317, Merkel J considered a contravention of s 615 of the then-applicable Corporations Law . Section 737 empowered the Court to "make such order or orders as it thinks just" and s 739(1) empowered a court to make "such orders as it thinks necessary or desirable to protect the interests of a person affected by the takeover scheme". His Honour held at 354-355:
 However, there might be a more appropriate and just remedy. It relates to Edensor's carried interest. Mr Lonergan's evidence, which valued that interest at $27-30 million, was only partly challenged by the respondents. As explained earlier, that is effectively the "price" paid by the Normandy group to Edensor to secure the bid structure agreement and the Shareholders Agreement or, put another way, a measure of the benefit obtained by Edensor by its contraventions of s 615. As a consequence of the payment of that "price" the shareholders were deprived of the opportunity of receiving an offer of a significantly higher price at the time of the bid and were left with little practical choice but to accept the offer made or to now exercise their right to require the acquisition by Yandal Gold of their shares pursuant to s 703(2). Is it just that that "price" be redirected to those who suffered the detriment arising from its payment? In my view an order that Edensor be required to disgorge to those shareholders the value of the benefit it received for its contravening conduct is "just" under s 737 and is protective of the interests of the shareholders under s 739.

66 It follows from the above that I am satisfied that the Panel made no error in making the orders.

67 For all of the above reasons the application must be dismissed. In the ordinary course, the respondents, having been successful, would be entitled to their costs. However, neither party made any submissions as to costs either orally or in writing. That being so I shall allow all parties time to make submissions as to costs before making any orders. 
 I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.

<tocase>Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel (2005) 54 ACSR 708</tocase>
<text>48 The notion that s 657D(2)(a) does not permit the Panel to make orders on the basis of a so-called " en globo " assessment of the likely loss or damages suffered by Rinker shareholders was said by CEMEX to be supported by Emmett J's comments in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel (2005) 54 ACSR 708 at 722, where his Honour said:
 [T]he review panel took no steps to determine whether, and if so, in what manner, any right or interest of any such person was affected by the non-disclosure. While the orders were purportedly made for the purposes of protecting the rights or interests of persons affected by the non-disclosure, the order applied indiscriminately to any person who sold shares on ASX during the relevant period, irrespective of whether any such person would have taken any different course had the relevant disclosure been made.

49 This submission does not take account of the amendments to the Corporations Act made by the Corporations Amendment (Takeovers) Act 2007 (Cth). The Explanatory Memorandum to the corresponding Bill makes it clear that the amendments were designed to respond to the concern that, following Glencore , "it may be open to read the Panel's powers and jurisdiction in the current legislation in way that is too narrowly formulated to enable the Panel to perform effectively the role envisaged for it by Parliament", in particular the power to make orders to protect the rights or interests of persons affected by unacceptable circumstances. In relation to s 657D(2)(a) the Explanatory Memorandum stated:
 Paragraph 657D(2)(a) of the Act currently allows the Panel to make orders it thinks appropriate to protect the rights or interests of any person affected by the circumstances. The amendment means that this is not confined to rights and interests directly affected by the circumstances. The amendment ensures that the Panel can make any order it thinks appropriate to protect any rights or interests of a person or group of persons, where the Panel is satisfied that their rights or interests have been, are being, will be or are likely to be affected by the unacceptable circumstances. This will allow the Panel to protect the interests of those persons more effectively. The amendment will also ensure that the Panel may make orders which protect the interests of a group of persons whose interests have been affected, rather than requiring it to address the effects person by person. (Emphasis added.)

50 I am satisfied that the Court was entitled to proceed en globo in its assessment of the extent to which shareholder's rights or interests were affected by the unacceptable circumstances. First, as well as being consistent with the express words of s 657D(2)(a) ("if the Panel is satisfied that the rights or interest of any person, or a group of persons ..."), such an approach recognises that the unacceptable circumstances misinformed the market as to the status of CEMEX's offer, thereby affecting the rights and interests of vendors of Rinker shares in that market, as a group. Counsel for ASIC, in my view accurately, summarised the steps taken by the Panel as follows:
 
&#8226; identifying a group of persons, namely those who sold their Rinker shares between 10 April and 7 May 2007;
 
&#8226; identifying the interests of those persons affected by the conduct, being the interest in ensuring that the relevant trading occurred in an efficient and informed market, and the interest in having a reasonable opportunity to participate in the benefits of the improved offer;
 
&#8226; making a finding that the market value of the improved offer consideration was around $0.25; and
 
&#8226; forming the view that an appropriate order was to compensate those persons in that amount.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The ADJR Act provides that an improper exercise of power includes, inter alia, taking an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of the power and failing to take a relevant consideration into account: s 5(2). CEMEX submitted that in declining to have regard to whether its conduct gave rise to a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B, or 6C of the Corporations Act or was otherwise contrary to law, the Panel ignored a consideration that it was bound to take into account in making the decision: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40. It is not in dispute that the Panel expressly declined to consider this question. Therefore the only issue for me to decide on this point is whether the Panel was required to have regard to it.

36 Section 657A(3)(a)(ii) imposes an obligation on the Panel, when contemplating a declaration of unacceptable circumstances, to have regard to "the other provisions of this Chapter [6]". CEMEX submitted that, because of the express reference in s 657A(2)(c) to Chapters 6A, 6B and 6C, the obligation extends also to those chapters. It accepted that a declaration of unacceptable circumstances may be made even if the circumstances do not give rise to a contravention of the Act; s 657A(1). It submitted, however, that a consideration need not be determinative to render it relevant. CEMEX referred to the Panel's observation that forming a view about whether a contravention had occurred would only be one aspect of considering whether the circumstances were unacceptable. It argued that it did not follow that the issue could be ignored.

37 CEMEX's submissions advocate a mechanistic approach to the interpretation of s 657A(3)(a). This is not what the section requires. An obligation to have regard to Chapter 6 does not require the decision maker to consider whether there has been a contravention of each and every applicable provision. The task of the Panel was to consider whether, as ASIC alleged, unacceptable circumstances had arisen. Section 657A(3)(a) sets out the matters that it is mandatory for the Panel to consider. The question of whether there has been a contravention of Chapters 6, 6A, 6B, 6C is not included as a mandatory matter. The fact that s 657A(1) specifically provides that it is not necessary for there to be a contravention of a provision of the Act, indicates that if the Panel considered CEMEX's conduct resulted in unacceptable circumstances irrespective of there being a contravention, it was not necessary for it to consider if there had been a contravention. It is clear that the fact of a contravention would be highly relevant to the question of whether the circumstances should be characterised as "unacceptable". If, however, such circumstances exist irrespective of a contravention, it is not necessary for the Panel to consider that issue.</text>

<tocase>Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/13.html</AustLII>
<text>7 Before discussing the Panel's decision, a brief overview of its composition and function is appropriate. The following outline, draws heavily on the submissions made by the Panel, which, consistent with the principle in Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 at 35-36, made submissions limited to the Panel's powers and procedures and not in the role of a protagonist.

8 The written submissions of the Panel outlined its history, commencing with its establishment under Part 10 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth). When that Act was repealed and replaced by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ( ASIC Act ), the Panel continued in existence by operation of s 261 of that Act. Initially, the Panel was known as the Corporations and Securities Panel. Its name was changed to the "Takeovers Panel" by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth). Interesting as the history is, it is not necessary to refer to it in any detail and I shall confine my comments to the present constitution and operation of the Panel.

9 The members of the Panel are appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the Minister and may be full-time or part-time members. They must be persons with knowledge or experience in one or more of the fields of business, administration of companies, financial markets, financial products and financial services, law, economics, and accounting; ASIC Act s 172(4). The Panel is not a legal entity, but is merely a collective term for the individual members.</text>
