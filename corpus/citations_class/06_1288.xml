<text>Whether an employer/employee relationship exists between parties is determined by the nature of their relationship and whether indicia of employment are evident. This issue has been the subject of much judicial comment. The leading Australian case on the topic is Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16 per Mason J at 24 and Wilson and Dawson JJ at 36, recently considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in ACT Visiting Medical Officers Association v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2006] FCAFC 109 at [19-21] , where incidents of the employment relationship were identified as: &#8226; the measure of control that the putative employer is entitled to exercise over the worker &#8226; the mode of remuneration &#8226; the provision and maintenance of equipment &#8226; the obligation to work &#8226; the hours of work &#8226; the provision for holidays &#8226; the deduction of income tax &#8226; the delegation of work &#8226; the right to have a particular person do the work &#8226; the right to suspend or dismiss the person engaged &#8226; the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged &#8226; the right to dictate the place of work.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/27.html</AustLII>
<text>It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).

There was no suggestion at any stage of the case that the plaintiff had acted vexatiously, or that there had been an abuse of process in any sense other than that the defendants had been irretrievably prejudiced by reason of the delay in the commencement of the proceedings. The majority noted the application of s 52 Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) suspending the running of limitation periods for the duration of a person's disability. They noted also however: 
 
 'the "right" of the plaintiff with a common law claim to institute an action is not at large. It is subject to the operation of the whole of the applicable procedural and substantive law administered by the court, whose processes are enlivened in the particular circumstances. This includes the principles respecting abuse of process.' [[2006] HCA 27 at [65]]

In concluding that there was no error of principle in the decision of the Court of Appeal, the majority of the High Court said: 
 
 '... in the circumstance of the present case, attention must be directed to the burdensome effect upon the defendants of the situation that has arisen by lapse of time. The Court of Appeal held that this was so serious that a fair trial was not possible. The result was that to permit the plaintiff's case to proceed would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the defendants. 
 What Deane J said in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 247, with respect to the staying of local proceedings, is applicable also to a case such as the present one. His Honour emphasised that there is no 'requirement that the continuance of the action would involve moral delinquency on the part of the plaintiff'; what was decisive was the objective effect of the continuation of the action. 
 In assessing that effect there must be taken into account the consideration expressed by Dixon in Cox v Journeaux [No 2] [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 and set out earlier in these reasons. Bryson JA in terms did so. He went on to remark in that connection that the defendants had not shown that the plaintiff's action was "clearly without foundation". But, he concluded that there was "in practical terms nothing of utility to place in the balance against the defendants' claim for a permanent stay.' [[2006] HCA 27 at [69-71]]</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/796.html</AustLII>
<text>Hoeben J at first instance rejected the submissions of the defendants in relation to ground (ii) that the plaintiff's claim was so obviously untenable that it could not possibly succeed or so manifestly faulty that it did not admit of argument ([2004] NSWSC 796 at [26]). Accordingly, his Honour declined to make an order summarily dismissing the plaintiff's claim. The conclusion of Hoeben J on this issue was endorsed by the NSW Court of Appeal ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [48]). That particular aspect of the decision of the Court of Appeal was not appealed to the High Court.

Hoeben J noted that the defendants carried the onus in relation to the application, and that: 
 
 'It is not for the plaintiff to establish that a fair trial can be had but for the defendants to establish that their chances of having a fair trial are so low that to allow the proceedings to continue would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive to them .' [[2004] NSWSC 796 at [41]]

His Honour was not satisfied however that the circumstances of the case were so exceptional that to allow the matter to proceed would be vexatious and oppressive to the defendants, and refused to permanently stay the plaintiff's claim either pursuant to Pt 13 r 5 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court.

The defendants appealed this aspect of the decision to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1935/48.html</AustLII>
<text>In any event, the caution with which courts approach an application for a permanent stay of proceedings before them is also well-known. It has been described as an exercise of discretion by a court in only the most exceptional circumstances. As Dixon J said in Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 720: 
 
 'The inherent jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the defendants which may be avoided without risk of injustice to the plaintiff. The principle, in general paramount, that a claim honestly made by a suitor for judicial relief must be investigated and decided in the manner appointed, must be observed. A litigant is entitled to submit for determination according to the due course of procedure a claim which he believes he can establish, although its foundation may in fact be slender. It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction, or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped.'

In concluding that there was no error of principle in the decision of the Court of Appeal, the majority of the High Court said: 
 
 '... in the circumstance of the present case, attention must be directed to the burdensome effect upon the defendants of the situation that has arisen by lapse of time.

Although as a general rule the applicants are entitled to bring their claims before the Court and have their claims heard, as I have already noted this entitlement is subject to principles in respect of abuse of court process. In reviewing the material before me however, I keep in mind the warning of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux and approach the matter with caution.

Key questions of evidence before the Court, for the purposes of this analysis, may be summarised as follows: 1. What is the likelihood of Mr Allan Hockey giving evidence? 2. To paraphrase Bryson JA in Batistatos , is there useful evidence available upon which to conduct a trial, or is the position that a trial of the proceedings could not rise above a debate about the effect of scraps of information with the result that no more than a formal enactment of the process of hearing and determining the plaintiff's claim could take place? This second question should be particularly considered in light of evidence to which the applicants refer, including: A) Records before the Court, as contained in the affidavit of Mr David Sutton sworn 22 November 2005, and the further evidence given by Mr Sutton arising from cross-examination on 17 July 2006. B) The affidavit of Mr Patrick Killoran sworn 12 May 2006. C) Affidavits of Sir Llewellyn Edwards, Hugh Lionel Fawsett and Sir Leo Arthur Hielscher. d) Queensland Government Cabinet documents from the relevant period. E) Affidavits of Bernadette Irene Albert, Evelyn May Barker, Shane Arthur O'Connor, Eric Michael Porter, Maxwell Athol Smith and Paul Toolis.

It is clear that obtaining evidence from Mr Hockey would be very important to the conduct of this case from the perspective of both the applicants and the respondents. Mr Hockey was appointed Acting Superintendent of the Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission Reserve from 1 November 1958. I understand he remained in that management position until some time in 1983, and that he eventually left Doomadgee on 6 April 1983. His management role means that he would be able to give key evidence as to the role of the respondent in the conduct of the Doomadgee Mission over that period, and to explain relevant documents and records from that period. The importance of that evidence is enhanced by the fact that a number of key witnesses involved in the management of Doomadgee mission, and liaison between the Doomadgee Mission and the respondent during the relevant period have died (for example, Mrs Hockey and Mr Bedford), or are elderly, frail and unable to give evidence (for example, Mr Killoran).

It is clear however that Mr Hockey himself is now elderly, and in frail health.

At the hearing on 14 July 2006 the ability of Mr Allan Hockey to give evidence at a hearing of the substantive matter was in dispute. Counsel for the applicants indicated that he had spoken with a third party who had been in contact with acquaintances of Mr Hockey, and was able to provide evidence that Mr Hockey was capable of giving evidence relevant to the issues in dispute. I indicated that, if this were the case, the best evidence would be that from Mr Hockey himself. I adjourned the hearing to allow the parties the opportunity to contact Mr Hockey and ascertain his ability to give evidence, whether at the hearing itself, by a preservation of evidence hearing, by affidavit or otherwise.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/123.html</AustLII>
<text>I am not required at this stage to consider whether s 46PR HREOC Act would be of assistance to the applicants, or whether comments of the Full Court in Hagan v Trustees of the Toowoomba Sports Ground Trust (2001) FCA 123 at 20 would be relevant in relation to the evidence which the applicants would seek to elicit from Mr Hockey. However it is, in my opinion, important to consider realistically what evidence is before or likely to come before the Court.

From the evidence of Dr Illes, it appears that even non-traditional questioning of Mr Hockey could be harmful to his health. On the facts before me I am of the view that Mr Hockey would not be able to give evidence in any form capable of being used by this Court, whether by affidavit, elicited by examination and cross-examination or otherwise as foreshadowed by Mr O'Gorman, or in person, by telephone or otherwise.

The ability of Mr Hockey to give evidence could be critical in that he could potentially explain such documents as exist relating to the management and operations of Doomadgee Mission. He appears to be the only person living with an intimate knowledge of the management of Doomadgee Mission during the relevant period, or who has the first hand knowledge to be in a position to explain documents relating to management of the Mission during that time.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The nature of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings itself reveals an important principle which confines its exercise namely that the power is, in essence, a power to refuse to exercise jurisdiction. The power is to be viewed in light of the principle that the conferral of jurisdiction imports a prima facie right in the person invoking that jurisdiction to have it exercised (Gaudron J in Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 76). This principle was itself elaborated by Deane J in re Queensland Electricity Commission; ex parte Electrical Trades Union of Australia [1987] HCA 27 ; (1987) 72 ALR 1 at 12 as: 
 
 'the prima facie right to insist upon the exercise of jurisdiction (as) a concomitant of a basic element of the rule of law, namely, that every person and organisation, regardless of rank, condition or official standing, is 'amendable to the jurisdiction' of the courts and other public tribunals.' 
 [cf Gaudron J in Jago at 76]

It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).

Applications for permanent stay based on effluxion of time appear to be rare (note comments of Bryson JA in Newcastle City Council v Batistatos [2005] NSWCA 20 at 56). The issue has however been the subject of comment by the High Court of Australia in the context of criminal proceedings ( Jago ), in relation to tribunal deliberations ( Walton v Gardiner ), and recently in relation to civil proceedings ( Batistatos ).

In any event, the caution with which courts approach an application for a permanent stay of proceedings before them is also well-known. It has been described as an exercise of discretion by a court in only the most exceptional circumstances. As Dixon J said in Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 720: 
 
 'The inherent jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the defendants which may be avoided without risk of injustice to the plaintiff. The principle, in general paramount, that a claim honestly made by a suitor for judicial relief must be investigated and decided in the manner appointed, must be observed. A litigant is entitled to submit for determination according to the due course of procedure a claim which he believes he can establish, although its foundation may in fact be slender. It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction, or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped.'

 'The purpose of s 9 is to provide a broad proscription of racial discrimination in almost any field... It provides a basis for challenge to many forms of discriminatory action ...

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2005/20.html</AustLII>
<text>Applications for permanent stay based on effluxion of time appear to be rare (note comments of Bryson JA in Newcastle City Council v Batistatos [2005] NSWCA 20 at 56). The issue has however been the subject of comment by the High Court of Australia in the context of criminal proceedings ( Jago ), in relation to tribunal deliberations ( Walton v Gardiner ), and recently in relation to civil proceedings ( Batistatos ).

As the Court of Appeal of New South Wales pointed out ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [13]): &#8226; grounds (i) and (iii) were the same in substance, as there was no suggestion that the proceedings in Batistatos were an abuse of process other than because the defendants were irretrievably prejudiced by reason of the delay in the proceedings being brought; and &#8226; ground (ii) indicated reliance by the defendants on the power of the Court to summarily dispose of proceedings in Pt 13 r 5, the test for which was whether the case was so clearly untenable that it could not possibly succeed (Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; [1964] 112 CLR 125 at 129-130).

Hoeben J at first instance rejected the submissions of the defendants in relation to ground (ii) that the plaintiff's claim was so obviously untenable that it could not possibly succeed or so manifestly faulty that it did not admit of argument ([2004] NSWSC 796 at [26]). Accordingly, his Honour declined to make an order summarily dismissing the plaintiff's claim. The conclusion of Hoeben J on this issue was endorsed by the NSW Court of Appeal ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [48]). That particular aspect of the decision of the Court of Appeal was not appealed to the High Court.

In delivering the lead judgment of the Court of Appeal, Bryson JA noted that, notwithstanding that the relevant limitation periods applicable to the plaintiff had not expired, it was nonetheless competent for the Court to entertain an application for a permanent stay on the proceedings due to effluxion of time ([2005] NSWCA 20 at 51-52, 57, citing McHugh JA in Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 253-255).

Although Hoeben J was persuaded by the plaintiff's location of three additional witnesses who had recollections of the road and the events which had happened in 1965, and affidavits of those witnesses, that the defendants had not taken steps reasonably open to them to identify and locate other persons with similar information, the Court of Appeal was not similarly influenced. Bryson JA considered that the information in the affidavits of the three 'new' witnesses was 'extremely slight and goes no real distance at all to establishing in any concrete way the state of affairs in which the accident happened in 1965... These three affidavits illustrate, to my mind rather fully, the process of degradation of the availability and quality of evidence where there are long delays' ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [65]). Accordingly, the Court of Appeal considered that Hoeben J erred in concluding that the defendants had not taken steps reasonably open to them to elicit knowledge and evidence of what the position then actually was ([2005] NSWCA 20 at [67]).

In the view of the Court of Appeal: 
 
 'the simple and overwhelmingly clear position is that no useful evidence is available upon which to conduct a trial into the question whether the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendants, and no further search or inquiry is in any way likely to locate any such evidence; so that a trial of the proceedings could not rise above a debate about the effect of scraps of information, and it is impossible to inform the debate with any realistically useful information.' [[2005] NSWCA 20 at [79]]

Further, in the view of the Court: 
 
 '...it would manifestly be quite unjust to allow these proceedings to go to what would in form be a trial but in substance would be only a ceremonial enactment of an opportunity to establish whether or not the plaintiff has the rights he claims.' [[2005] NSWCA 20 at [81]]

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the decision of Hoeben J, and ordered that the proceedings be permanently stayed.

The majority judgment was that of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Their Honours observed that the appeals before them concerned abuse of process as understood in the exercise of the 'inherent jurisdiction' of superior courts to stay proceedings (at [5]).</text>

<text>The nature of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings itself reveals an important principle which confines its exercise namely that the power is, in essence, a power to refuse to exercise jurisdiction. The power is to be viewed in light of the principle that the conferral of jurisdiction imports a prima facie right in the person invoking that jurisdiction to have it exercised (Gaudron J in Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 76). This principle was itself elaborated by Deane J in re Queensland Electricity Commission; ex parte Electrical Trades Union of Australia [1987] HCA 27 ; (1987) 72 ALR 1 at 12 as: 
 
 'the prima facie right to insist upon the exercise of jurisdiction (as) a concomitant of a basic element of the rule of law, namely, that every person and organisation, regardless of rank, condition or official standing, is 'amendable to the jurisdiction' of the courts and other public tribunals.'

<tocase>Reid v New Zealand Trotting Conference [1984] 1 NZLR 8</tocase>
<text>Proceedings which are an 'abuse of process' however are potentially a broad class, not limited to fixed categories. As pointed out by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos at [9]: 
 
 'What amounts to abuse of court process is insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories. Development continues.' 


(Note similar comments of Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police at 536, Richardson J in Reid v New Zealand Trotting Conference [1984] 1 NZLR 8 at 9.)

In Batistatos , their Honours considered earlier decisions where abuse of process in the sense of abuse of court process was discussed, and observed that circumstances where courts have formed the view that conduct constituted abuse of process included where: &#8226; proceedings were pending in another forum &#8226; proceedings were instituted for an improper or illegitimate purpose &#8226; proceedings were seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging, including where there had been an unreasonable delay in commencing proceedings &#8226; proceedings were of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment &#8226; the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute &#8226; proceedings were frivolous or vexatious &#8226; there was no triable issue &#8226; it was impossible for the defendants to obtain a fair trial in the circumstances of the case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/1.html</AustLII>
<text>Whether an employer/employee relationship exists between parties is determined by the nature of their relationship and whether indicia of employment are evident. This issue has been the subject of much judicial comment. The leading Australian case on the topic is Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16 per Mason J at 24 and Wilson and Dawson JJ at 36, recently considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in ACT Visiting Medical Officers Association v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2006] FCAFC 109 at [19-21] , where incidents of the employment relationship were identified as: &#8226; the measure of control that the putative employer is entitled to exercise over the worker &#8226; the mode of remuneration &#8226; the provision and maintenance of equipment &#8226; the obligation to work &#8226; the hours of work &#8226; the provision for holidays &#8226; the deduction of income tax &#8226; the delegation of work &#8226; the right to have a particular person do the work &#8226; the right to suspend or dismiss the person engaged &#8226; the right to the exclusive services of the person engaged &#8226; the right to dictate the place of work.</text>

<text>The reference to 'contract for services' in s 3(1) is to the traditional distinction at common law between an 'employee' who was employed under a 'contract of service', and an independent contractor who was engaged under a 'contract for services'. Historically, employers could be liable for wrongs inflicted on a third party by an employee, but not where the worker was an independent contractor (see for example B Creighton and A Stewart Labour Law: An Introduction (The Federation Press, 2000) pars 7.02-7.06 and the recent discussion of these principles by the High Court in Sweeney v Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 19 ; (2006) 227 ALR 46 at 49). This distinction is not relevant in the case before me the only point is whether the applicants were employees of the respondent at the relevant time.</text>

<text>This comment appears equally relevant today: one of the few cases considering s 9 in isolation is Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1998) 91 FCR 8 per Weinberg J, confirmed on appeal as Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47. In that case, Weinberg J at first instance found inter alia that: &#8226; 'based on' in s 9(1) encompasses the broader, non-necessarily causative, relationship expressed in the phrase 'by reference to' &#8226; motive, intention or purpose are irrelevant under s 9(1).</text>

<text>It is clear that superior courts of justice, including the Federal Court of Australia, have the power to control and supervise proceedings brought within their jurisdiction, including the power to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process (cf Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Mason CJ at 25, 28, Deane J at 58, Gaudron J at 74, 76; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393; Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982) AC 529 at 536; Miller v University of New South Wales [2003] FCAFC 180 at [77-81] ; and note the consideration of this issue by the majority of the High Court in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [5-8] and by Kirby J at [121-128]).

Applications for permanent stay based on effluxion of time appear to be rare (note comments of Bryson JA in Newcastle City Council v Batistatos [2005] NSWCA 20 at 56). The issue has however been the subject of comment by the High Court of Australia in the context of criminal proceedings ( Jago ), in relation to tribunal deliberations ( Walton v Gardiner ), and recently in relation to civil proceedings ( Batistatos ).</text>
