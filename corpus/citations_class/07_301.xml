<tocase>Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280</tocase>
<text>30 Before considering the rival contentions, I mention three matters of a general nature which were the subject of submissions. First, the respondent referred to the well-established principle that I should not analyse the reasons of the Tribunal with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. That is certainly a matter which I must bear in mind, although I think the 'principle' is of limited relevance here because both the Tribunal's reasons and the points of construction raised by the applicant are reasonably clear. Secondly, the respondent submits that in construing the sections of the Act, I should bear in mind that it is remedial or beneficial legislation and is to be interpreted liberally. Workers Compensation legislation is often referred to as a prime example of such legislation. However, I must also bear in mind the limits on this approach to statutory construction. In Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Brown [2003] HCA 54 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1797 (at [33] (footnotes omitted) Heydon J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said:
 
 'To begin consideration of issues of construction by positing that a "liberal", "broad", or "narrow" construction will be given tends to obscure the essential question, that of determining the meaning the relevant words used require. Although the purpose of the Act is beneficial, it does not follow that recovery is contemplated for every act of violence or every consequence that could be described as an injury. The numerous injuries set out in the table to Sch 1 (which extends over 12 pages) are identified with considerable precision. The clauses in Sch 1 which precede the table, too, are drafted with some attempt at precision. The legislation confers benefits, and no doubt it should not be construed restrictively, but in dealing with specific limited words like those of cl 5, it is not open to apply much liberality of construction. It is difficult to state the legislative purpose except at such extreme levels of generality that it is not useful in construing particular parts of the legislative language. As Spigelman CJ said,"The issue before the Court is the determination of the circumstances in which compensation is payable." The legislation has endeavoured to define these circumstances in precise language which does not permit universal recovery; and hence "[t]he Court is not required to give the most expansive possible interpretation of such circumstances".'</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth of Australia v Duncan (1982) 44 ALR 249</tocase>
<text>13 Section 32 is the general provision dealing with journeys to and from employment. Journeys which fall within the terms of s 32 are deemed to constitute part of an employee's employment by the Commonwealth. The journeys which fall within the section are journeys which are to and from the employee's 'employment by the Commonwealth'. In Commonwealth of Australia v Duncan (1982) 44 ALR 249 the Full Court of this Court said that the question posed by s 32 was whether the employee was journeying to or from a state of activity called employment and not whether he was journeying to or from his place of employment (at 259 per Kelly J; at 266 per Fitzgerald J). The Tribunal member held that the circumstances of the case before him did not fall within the terms of s 32(1) because although the respondent was travelling to his place of employment, he was not travelling to his duties of employment.

14 Sections 33 and 34 deem certain journeys to be journeys to the employee's employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s 32(1). I will focus on journeys to the employee's employment by the Commonwealth. Both of the sections are subject to the provisions of ss 35 and 36 but, subject to one matter which I will mention, those sections are not relevant for present purposes.

15 Section 33(1) provides that where an employee (other than an employee to whom s 34 applies) makes a journey to his place of employment within the period prescribed in the section or if the journey would have ended within the prescribed period then he is deemed to have made a journey to his employment by the Commonwealth. The prescribed period is a period of one hour immediately before he commenced work or would have commenced work. An employee whose journey ended or would have ended before the prescribed period may nevertheless be deemed to have made a journey to his employment by the Commonwealth if ' the journey was made by the last means of transport :
 
 (i) that was conveniently available for use by the employee; 
 
 
 (ii) that would ordinarily have enabled the employee to complete the journey before the time at which he intended to commence work; and 
 (iii) that was of a kind that the employee could, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, have been reasonably expected to use, ...'

<tocase>Maunder v Commonwealth of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 44</tocase>
<text>23 The Tribunal member referred to two authorities: Maunder v Commonwealth of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 44; Re James and Commonwealth of Australia [1983] AAT, N81/272 (Unreported, R K Todd, 6 July 1983) and then turned to consider whether the means of transport adopted by the respondent (ie driving his own motor vehicle) satisfied the three requirements in s 34(4)(b)(i),(ii) and (iii). He held that the means of transport adopted by the respondent did satisfy the requirements and he said that the following were 'some' of the relevant circumstances:
 
 
 '1. The applicant used his own personal vehicle as the means of transport in accordance with what was obviously a long established practice and entitlement of Army personnel. The Army accepted that a soldier in the applicant's position was entitled to use his private vehicle to travel to his new posting and the Army was prepared to grant time and money to the applicant to facilitate that. 
 2. If the applicant were to return to Holsworthy by air travel it would have been necessary for him to return to Perth from Kalgoorlie in order to do so. 
 3. I accept the applicant's evidence that it was necessary and desirable to allow some leeway in travelling time so as to cater for the possibility of mechanical trouble and I also accept the evidence of the applicant and Mr March that it was normal for personnel arriving at a new base to arrive early. I note in passing that the current Army practice of calculating travel time on the basis of driving about 600 kilometres per day would imply a reasonable travelling time for the applicant of approximately 5 days. In my opinion it would have been unreasonable for a person in the applicant's position to have attempted to time his arrival at Holsworthy after such a long journey to the period between 8.00 pm on 23 September and 7.30 am on 24 September especially as he was expected to be fit for duty at 7.30 am.'

24 The Tribunal member then turned to consider if the means of transport adopted by the respondent was the last means of transport which satisfied s 34(4)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii). He decided that it was, although as to public transport he said no more than that 'although public transport may have been an option for the [respondent], it was not an option that, in my opinion, satisfied the three provisos ...'.

25 For these reasons, the Tribunal member concluded that the journey was deemed to be a journey to the respondent's employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s 32(1) of the 1971 Act and therefore part of his employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s 27(1) of that Act.

41 I was referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Maunder v Commonwealth of Australia (supra). That case concerned a claim by Captain Maunder's widow for compensation in relation to the death of Captain Maunder from injuries he sustained in an accident in his own motor vehicle some time after he had left a regimental depot. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal rejected the claim on the ground that the means of transport used by Captain Maunder, having regard to his inebriated state, was not one he could reasonably have been expected to use within s 33(3)(b)(iii). It is true that the Court did not say transport by private motor vehicle could never be the 'first' means of transport (the case involved a journey from work) within s 33(3)(b), but the Tribunal had decided the case on a different ground and the only issue before the Full Court was whether the Tribunal had erred in law in doing so. The applicant sought to draw some support for its second submission from the following observation made by the Court (at 51):
 
 'In speaking of the first available means of transport, s 33(3)(b) read in its context is clearly referring to the means of transport first available to the employee after the employee ceased work. The legislative intention seems to be that, if the employee delays in leaving his place of employment and commencing his journey until after the prescribed period, he must, to obtain the benefit of s 33, show that a means of transport was not available to him during the prescribed period.'

42 The applicant submitted that this observation, appropriately adapted, applied equally to those provisions dealing with journeys to employment and that an employee like the respondent who could choose to leave in his own motor vehicle at a time such that he would arrive within the prescribed period did not fall within the provisions of s 34(4)(b) of the Act. There is a good deal of force in this submission. However, I have reached the conclusion that if I were to accept the submission I would be reading words into the section which are not there. There is nothing in the section which requires the employee to show that there is no means of transport which would see him arrive within the prescribed period, or which provides that transport by private motor vehicle cannot be the last means of transport within the subsection because the employee can choose when to commence his journey and therefore, to a point in the case of a long journey, when he will arrive.

43 Once these conclusions are reached, a conclusion that it was open to the Tribunal member to find that in the particular circumstances of this case the journey by the respondent in his own motor vehicle satisfied the requirements of s 34(4)(b) is inevitable. The Army not only allowed him to drive his own motor vehicle to the Army base at Holsworthy but granted him leave to do so and contributed to the costs of doing so. In the particular circumstances of this case, transport in this way was not only a means of transport he could reasonably have been expected to use, but was the means of transport he could reasonably have been expected to use. I reject the applicant's challenge to the Tribunal member's conclusion that the case fell within the terms of s 34(4).

44 I reject the applicant's submissions and, accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. I will hear the parties as to the costs of the appeal.
