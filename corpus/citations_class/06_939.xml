<tocase>Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315</tocase>
<text>2 On 4 December 2003, after a contested hearing in the above proceedings, I ordered that the present applicant, Mr Kemp, be joined as a party to each of the proceedings (see Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315). I did so in reliance on unchallenged evidence which tended to establish that Mr Kemp is a descendant of the Pirripaayi people who are traditionally associated by Aboriginal law and custom with an area which includes the Saltwater land.

3 In Davis-Hurst at [14]-[15] I observed:
 
 'It is apparently because of resource implications that Mr Kemp does not wish to advance a claim for a determination of native title in respect of Saltwater, either on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself and other living descendents of the Pirripaayi people. However, he is concerned that a determination in favour of the applicant would give formal recognition to a version of history that does not recognise the Pirripaayi people as the traditional owners of Saltwater. Mr Kemp's concern is not alleviated by the possibility that there may be extensive, or even complete, overlaps between the present claimant group and the living descendants of the Pirripaayi people. 
 
 Mr Kemp is further concerned, as I understand him, that it is possible, or even likely, that the applicant is the wrong person to represent the claimant group, however described, in these proceedings. Mr Kemp believes, on the basis of information which he has obtained from Mr Marr, that under traditional Aboriginal law and custom a woman cannot claim the areas of land the subject of the applications. He also believes, apparently on the same basis, that the applicant may not accept, or perhaps be aware of, the correct dreaming story and the customary laws of the area in question. As is mentioned above, his belief is that the applicant accepts a version of the history of the claim areas that fails to give proper recognition to the connection of the Pirripaayi people to Saltwater.'

4 I noted at [19] that Mr Kemp's evidence disclosed two underlying concerns. First, a concern that Dr Davis-Hurst and the Kattang people of the Manning Valley are not the group who hold the common or group rights comprising the native title in the Saltwater land. Secondly, a concern as to the identity of the traditional laws and customs under which that native title is held.

5 In Davis-Hurst at [27] I concluded that Mr Kemp, as a descendant of the Pirripaayi people, had standing to oppose the making of the determinations of native title sought by Dr Davis-Hurst. No appeal was instituted against the order made on 4 June 2003 joining Mr Kemp as a respondent to the applications for determinations of native title in the Saltwater land.

6 On 11 August 2005 the second respondent, the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, applied to the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal pursuant to s 24CG of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for the registration of an indigenous land use agreement ('the Agreement') in respect of the Saltwater land. Mr Kemp is not a party to the Agreement. The parties to the Agreement are the second to seventh respondents to this proceeding; that is, two Ministers of State for New South Wales, the Director-General of a New South Wales government department, the local government body for the relevant area, Dr Davis-Hurst and an entity described in the recitals to the Agreement as having been incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Association Act 1976 (Cth) for the purpose of holding native title in trust for the Saltwater People.

7 The recitals to the Agreement refer to the proceedings in this Court for determinations of native title in respect of the Saltwater land. They then record:
 
 
 'D. The State on the basis of evidence provided by the Registered Native Title Claimant is prepared to recognise that the Saltwater People hold native title rights and interests in the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 E. The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) recognising that the Applicant and the Saltwater People hold native title in the land and waters concerned; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) regulating the exercise by the Saltwater People and the Saltwater Tribal Council of the native title rights and interests in the Agreement Area; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) providing for a role for the Saltwater Tribal Council in the future management of the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) providing for the withdrawal of native title determination applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98); and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) settling other matters between the Parties. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 F. The Greater Taree City Council, the land manager of the former Saltwater Reserve, agrees with and supports the making of this Agreement to resolve native title applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98).'</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>48 I take the proper approach to the determination of this issue to be as stated by McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 384. Their Honours there said:
 
 'the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning.' (footnotes omitted)

49 The two competing views as to the meaning of the words in s 24CG(3)(b)(i) are:
 
 
 (a) that the words should be construed literally so that, for example, where two competing groups each claims to hold the common or group rights which constitute the native title in the area, the words are capable of including the persons in both groups; or
 (b) that the words should not be construed literally but should be understood to refer to all persons who, according to the traditional laws and customs of the registered native title claimants, hold the common or group rights which constitute the native title in the area.

50 It is appropriate to consider whether any of the factors identified in the passage from Project Blue Sky cited above require the words of s 24CG(3)(b)(i) to be read in a way that does not correspond with their literal or grammatical meaning. The factors upon which the respondents placed reliance are the following.

51 First, as they submitted, the words 'may hold native title' in s 24CG(3)(b)(i) are not words of expansion but rather are intended to demonstrate that proof of native title is not necessary before an area agreement may be registered. I accept that the words 'may hold native title' demonstrate that proof of native title is not necessary before an area agreement may be registered. However, this does not, of itself, assist in determining which of the two competing views of the meaning of s 24CG(3)(b)(i) should be accepted.

52 Secondly, s 24CL makes it impossible for an area agreement to be registered unless all persons who were registered native title claimants at the end of the notice period, and all persons who subsequently became registered native title claimants pursuant to applications made before the end of the notice period, are parties to the agreement. The respondents argued that s 24CL discloses an intention that a person like Mr Kemp should not be able to prevent the registration of the area Agreement unless he first becomes a registered native title claimant; as Mr Kemp chose not to adopt that course, the group represented by Dr Davis-Hurst was free to obtain registration of the agreement without his being a party to it and without obtaining his authority to make it.

55 What then are the factors which favour the first of the two competing views as to the meaning of the words 'all persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement' in s 24CG(3)(b)(i)? As the passage from Project Blue Sky cited above indicates, the strongest argument in favour of the first of the competing views is the literal meaning of the words. The words do not readily admit of limitation. No real difficulty would have attended drafting the passage in more limited terms.

56 Additionally, comparable words, namely 'any person claiming to hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement' , are used in s 24CH(2)(d)(ii) of the Act with an apparently expansive meaning. In the context of s 24CH(2)(d)(ii) the comparable words must, I think, be intended to include any person who advances a claim in opposition to the claim to native title recognised by the agreement. The paragraph is intended to place such a person on notice that, in effect, the agreement might be registered, irrespective of his or her views as to its contents, unless he or she formally asserts a claim to native title. (see [53] above)

57 Finally, a determination that the words of s 24CG(3)(b)(i) are not to be given their literal meaning could result in interference with, if not loss of, a person's native title rights in respect of the area covered by the agreement. While details of an agreement are entered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, the agreement has effect as if all persons holding native title in relation to any of the land or waters in the area who are not already parties to the agreement were bound by the agreement in the same way as the native title group (s 24EA). As a consequence a person who has a prima facie claim to hold native title but who is not a party to the agreement would be bound by any consents thereby given to the doing of future acts or classes of future acts (s 24CB(a) and (aa)). Indeed, it appears that the person could be bound by a surrender of native title rights and interests in the area to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory and the consequent extinguishment of those rights and interests (s 24CB(e) and s 24EB(1)(d) and (3)).

61 Ultimately I am not persuaded that any of the factors identified in the passage from Project Blue Sky cited in [48] above requires the words of s 24CG(3)(b)(i) to be read in a way that does not correspond to their literal meaning. I decline to so read them.

62 For the above reasons, I conclude that the Registrar erred in concluding that the requirements of s 24CG(3)(b) had been met in the present case. I further conclude that it would not be appropriate to refrain from setting aside her decision on the basis that the error was not material because it was unnecessary for Mr Kemp to authorise the making of the agreement.

63 The decision of the Registrar that the Agreement must be registered pursuant to s 24CL(1) of the Act will be set aside and the application for registration remitted to the Registrar to be determined according to law. I will hear the parties on the appropriate order or orders, if any, to be made as to costs.
 

 I certify that the preceding sixty-three (63) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson.
