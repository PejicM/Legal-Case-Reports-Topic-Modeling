<text>I recently discussed the principles applicable to preliminary discovery under O 15 r 6 in East Grace Corporation v Xing (No 2) [2005] FCA 1266. It is not necessary to repeat here that discussion and the citation of authorities there set out.

For the purposes of O 15A r 6 and O 15A r 3, I am satisfied that: There is reasonable cause to believe that Austal has, or may have, the right to obtain relief in this Court from Messrs Merrigan and Thurlow for one or more of the following causes of action: 
 (i) breach of confidence and infringement of copyright in the case of Mr Merrigan; 
 
 (ii) infringement of copyright in the case of Mr Thurlow and possible accessorial liability in relation to breach of confidence. 
 The applicant has made what, in the circumstances, are all reasonable enquiries. The term 'reasonable' in this context falls to be considered having regard to the degree of urgency necessary to act upon what is, on the face of it, a potentially serious breach of an obligation of confidentiality and unauthorised reproduction of a sensitive internal report of Austal. Wider enquiries are unlikely to elicit information relevant to the decision that Austal has to make as the necessary documentation is likely to be held by the respective respondents. No offer of disclosure has been made in response to the requests which have been sent. The offer of further investigation by Mr Clifford in the email sent to Mr Rothwell did not promise the kind of disclosure necessary for Austal to make the decision which it wants to make in relation to the institution of proceedings. There is reasonable cause to believe that Mr Merrigan and Mr Thurlow are likely to have in their possession documents, including email communications and copies of the Austal Report, relevant to the question whether Austal has a right to obtain relief against them.

In the case of the Incat respondents, there are a number of companies some of which may have had no involvement at all in Mr Thurlow's apparent conduct in sending a copy of the Austal Report to Master Ferries. An order for discovery against the Incat respondents is likely to assist Austal in ascertaining against which, if any of them, it may have a cause of action. As to those of the respondents which are not involved, such respondents would have knowledge of facts as to their non-involvement which will assist the process of ascertainment of the relevant respondents which is contemplated by O 15A r 3. Discovery against Incat will also serve to assist Austal in ascertaining whether Mr Merrigan or some other person had breached confidentiality or infringed its copyright.</text>
