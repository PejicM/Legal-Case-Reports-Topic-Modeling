<tocase>Maniotis v JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 7</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/7.html</AustLII>
<text>As I see it, each of the parties bears some responsibility for their joint failure to bring forward the true issue between them that required prompt identification and resolution. I pointed out during the course of argument that in commercial litigation of this character and, as indeed in other litigation in today's society, that approach is unacceptable for the reasons given by Allsop J in White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] which were applied by Heydon JA with the endorsement of Mason P and Young CJ in Eq in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 346 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 116 at 128 129 [28] [32] and by a Full Court of this Court in Maniotis v JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 7 at [72] per Finn, Emmett and Bennett JJ. In the last case, the Court said: 
 
 "In the efficient and proper conduct of civil litigation, even civil litigation hard fought between parties, it should always be recognised that, in the propounding of issues for trial, the parties should take steps to ensure that all relevant parties to the dispute are cognisant of what the issues are. Quietly leaving footprints in correspondence or directions hearings to be uncovered some time later in an attempt to reveal that a matter was always in issue is a practice that must be firmly discouraged. Where it is evident, or indeed suspected, that the other side is proceeding on the basis of a misconception or has not appreciated something, common sense will, as a general rule, mandate that a party ensure that the other is not proceeding on a misconception or that the other does appreciate something that has been said. No one's interests are advanced by litigation proceeding on assumptions which are seen or suspected to be false. The only consequence of keeping issues hidden or not clearly identifying them is to disrupt the business of the court leading to the waste of valuable public resources and to lead to the incurring of unnecessary costs by the parties, costs which ultimately have to be borne by someone: see White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] ."</text>

<text>As might have been expected, the bill of lading contains a " Himalaya " clause in the widest terms which is usual in such transactions. In Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 193 [79] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ noted that courts have been ready to conclude in cases of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority. They referred to the judgment of Barwick CJ in Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Limited [1978] HCA 8 ; (1978) 139 CLR 231 at 241. His judgment was expressly approved in the last appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court of Australia: Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Limited (" The New York Star ") (1980) 144 CLR 300 at 305. As Lord Wilberforce, delivering the judgment of a powerful board, said in The New York Star 144 CLR at 304, the significance of the majority decision of the Privy Council in New Zealand Shipping Co Limited v Satterthwaite &amp; Co Limited [1974] UKPC 1 ; [1975] AC 154 was: 
 
 "...not so much in the establishment of any new legal principle, as in the finding that in the normal situation involving the employment of stevedores by carriers, accepted principles enable and require the stevedore to enjoy the benefit of contractual provisions in the bill of lading."</text>
