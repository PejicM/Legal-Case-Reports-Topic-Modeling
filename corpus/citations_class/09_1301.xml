<text>The applicant applies for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a decision in the Federal Magistrates Court in which Smith FM dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( SZNGR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 630). The Tribunal in turn affirmed a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant's application for a protection visa.

The applicant's explanation for the delay in filing a notice of appeal, as set out in an affidavit affirmed by him, is that he did not know Australian law and was not aware that he had 21 days after the decision was handed down. There is no need to deal with the aspect of delay further because the Minister concedes that the delay is not great and could not be said to cause any prejudice.

However, it is necessary for the Court to have regard to the merits of the appeal in order to decide if the extension of time should be granted. The draft notice of appeal contains two grounds: "His Honour Smith failed to accept grounds listed in my amended application." "The Tribunal failed to understand my claim."

On consideration of the grounds in the amended application that were before his Honour, and on consideration of the Tribunal decision, it is apparent that the Tribunal decision was based upon the following bases which, in turn, needed to be considered by Smith FM in assessing the applicant's application to him.

The Tribunal considered the different incidents described by the applicant and set them out in some detail in its reasons. The Tribunal recognised that the applicant claimed to fear persecution in Lebanon on the grounds of religion and perceived association with, or membership of, the Lebanese forces. His claim was also based upon a lack of employment resulting from the unstable situation in Lebanon and the conflict in the area in which he lived and worked. The Convention reasons advanced by the applicant were religion and perceived political association.

The Tribunal found that none of the incidents, individually or cumulatively, amounted to persecution within the meaning of s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), either because they did not come within the description of serious harm within the instances set out in s 91R(2) , or because the description did not involve systematic and discriminatory conduct, or both. Further, the Tribunal concluded that in any event, the incidents described by the applicant did not occur for a Convention reason or by reason of a Convention characteristic.

The Tribunal found that any inability of the applicant to earn a living by delivering goods to Tripoli was as a result of general conflict and not for a Convention reason. The Tribunal found that there was no relevant Convention nexus with the applicant's claimed financial difficulties and concluded that there was no real chance that the applicant would be persecuted for a Convention reason if he were to return to Lebanon now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.</text>
