<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/794.html</AustLII>
<text>18 T2 reminded itself of the need when assessing credibility to be sensitive to the difficulties often faced by asylum seekers. It said that the benefit of the doubt should be given to asylum seekers who are generally credible but unable to substantiate all of their claims. It referred to various authorities, including Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 , which held that where a Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim, but cannot make that finding with confidence, it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that it might possibly be true.

19 T2 noted the delegate's view that the appellant had been generally forthright at his initial interview and that the answers he gave to questions had been consistent with information contained in his written application. T2 further noted that T1 had found it unnecessary to determine whether the appellant was in fact homosexual but had rejected his claims for other reasons. T2 went on to conclude that the appellant was not, and never had been, homosexual, relying upon what it regarded as the implausibility of a gay activist leading a "reclusive" life in Australia, at least in terms of his contact with Sydney's gay community. It therefore rejected his account of past mistreatment in the Ukraine. For that reason, T2 affirmed the delegate's decision.

20 On 5 May 2006 the Federal Magistrates Court, by consent, set aside T2's decision. It once again remitted the matter to be reheard and determined according to law. Once again, the reason for the Minister's consent is not apparent.</text>

<tocase>Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/58.html</AustLII>
<text>64 Underlying the Minister's submission is a misconception. It is assumed that factual errors, leading to a finding that an applicant is not a witness of truth, cannot give rise to jurisdictional error. That is not the case. As has been repeatedly stated, there are two varieties of factual error. The first, taking into account an irrelevant fact, or failing to take into account a relevant fact, is an error in reasoning and can give rise to a successful application for judicial review: Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351. So too is arriving at a conclusion that is unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. The second, namely giving too much, or too little, weight to particular evidence does not provide a ground of judicial review. Decisions on questions of fact of that kind are committed to merits review tribunals, such as the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/21.html</AustLII>
<text>65 It is clear that "the merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone": Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 36 per Brennan J. However, the process is not simply one of classification and there are problems at the margin.

66 I accept that at common law want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. I also accept that in general, when considering factual matters, the Tribunal may draw inferences that are incorrect and give rise to findings that are wrong without necessarily thereby committing jurisdictional error. However, every case must be considered in the light of its own particular circumstances, and there comes a point at which it may fairly be said that the Tribunal has not discharged its statutory function.</text>

<tocase>NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/77.html</AustLII>
<text>67 The decision of the High Court in NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 provides a useful illustration of the fine lines that sometimes have to be drawn. In that case, a husband, wife and their daughter applied for protection. The application was refused. On 5 June 1997 they applied to the Tribunal for review. The Tribunal held oral hearings on 6 May 1998 and again on 19 December 2001. However, it did not hand down its decision affirming the delegate's decision until 14 January 2003. The Tribunal said that it did not accept as credible certain claims made, and evidence given by, the applicants.

68 In proceedings for judicial review, the applicants submitted that the delay in determining the review involved a denial of procedural fairness or a failure by the Tribunal to perform its statutory functions. The application was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Full Federal Court.

69 The High Court, by majority (Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ, with Gummow and Hayne JJ dissenting) reversed the decision of the Full Federal Court. Gleeson CJ, with Kirby J agreeing, held that the delay created a real and substantial risk that the Tribunal's capacity to assess the applicants' evidence and evaluate their claims was so impaired as to deny them a fair hearing. In a separate judgment, Callinan and Heydon JJ held that procedural unfairness could spring not only from a denial of an opportunity to present a case but also from the denial of an opportunity to consider it. The applicants' demeanour and credibility were relevant to the Tribunal's decision. It could be inferred from the delay that, in the absence of contrary evidence, the Tribunal had deprived itself of its capacity to assess their oral evidence.

83 Speaking generally, therefore, NAIS stands as support for the proposition that lengthy delay, unacknowledged by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision , can give rise to jurisdictional error. This may be because the Tribunal has failed to take into account a matter that it was obliged to consider: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24. Alternatively, it may be that the Tribunal has denied the applicant a fair hearing, and thereby denied him procedural fairness.

84 The Minister submitted that NAIS could be distinguished from the present case. NAIS concerned delay and its effect upon the capacity of the Tribunal to assess demeanour. The present case also involved delay but not in the way that this issue arose in NAIS .

86 The Minister did not specifically challenge the proposition that the decision in NAIS established that delay could, in some circumstances, give rise to a denial of procedural fairness. Nor did he necessarily accept that proposition. He submitted, however, that the particular circumstances of this case were far removed from those in NAIS . There the Tribunal had made demeanour-based findings against an appellant in circumstances in which four and a half years had elapsed between the observation of the demeanour and the making of the findings. In the present case, the differences between the accounts given by the appellant over time relied upon by T3 had never featured in the reasoning of either T1 or T2. In other words, the Minister submitted, it could not logically be said that delay had had any impact upon the memory of the appellant or upon his ability to give evidence. Rather, it appeared that the delay had had an "improving effect" upon his memory. It was for that reason that T3 found that he had in fact fabricated his claims.

87 Further, the Minister submitted, as the Federal Magistrate found, T3 was well aware of the chronology of the evidence given by the appellant, including the number of times, the dates, the successful applications for judicial review, and the content of what he had previously said. That justified his Honour's finding that T3 had "implicitly" taken all relevant matters into account and, more particularly, all matters that it was obliged to take into account. The Minister contended that the appellant's submission amounted to no more than an attack upon the merits of T3's decision.

88 I accept the Minister's submission that NAIS is not directly in point. However, the principles underlying the majority view seem to me to be relevant, by analogy, to the particular circumstances of this case.

89 As previously indicated, the appellant first gave a detailed account of his past history in the Ukraine as far back as 2001. Some of the events that he described were relatively recent at that stage. However, through no fault of his own, he was obliged over the next four years to recall repeatedly the details of events that must have become more difficult to remember with the passage of time.

90 In my view, T3 was obliged to take that aspect of delay into account when considering any possible inconsistencies between the various statements that he made regarding these events.

98 However, when one adds to the mix the fact that none of the inconsistencies identified were properly analysed, several seemed to have misstated the appellant's earlier position, and some involved summaries taken out of context, the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong. To use the language of Gummow J in NAIS , the Tribunal did not give "proper, genuine and realistic" consideration to the appellant's case. He was not afforded the hearing to which the law entitled him.

99 In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred in dismissing the appellant's complaints by treating the Tribunal as having "implicitly" taken into account matters that I frankly doubt it ever considered.

100 It follows that the appeal must be allowed. The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court must be set aside. There will be orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus, which will have the effect of quashing the decision given by T3 and remitting the matter to a fourth Tribunal to be dealt with according to law. 

 I certify that the preceding one hundred (100) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg .

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/32.html</AustLII>
<text>85 The Minister noted that the appellant sought to rely upon Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 as support for the proposition that T3 was obliged to consider the so-called delay that occurred in this case before making its finding on credit: However, the Minister submitted, Abebe did not support the appellant's proposition. In Abebe , Gummow and Hayne JJ, in referring to the potential for refugee applicants to embroider their claims, nevertheless stated that the significance of such embroidery was a matter for the Tribunal in assessing the merits of the case.</text>

<tocase>Hadid v Redpath (2001) 35 MVR 152</tocase>
<text>94 An analogous point, in the context of a negligence action, was made by Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, in Hadid v Redpath (2001) 35 MVR 152, where he said at [34]:
 "... [N]o favourable assumptions could be made, and it was up to the trial judge to put beyond question any suggestion that he or she had lost an understanding of the issues. Something should be said about how the possible effects of delay on the judicial process have been overcome. Some explanation should be given as to how the trial judge had recorded or recaptured impressions formed of witnesses at the time they testified. A judge might, for example, say 'I have a perfect recollection of all the characters in the trial' or 'I have contemporaneous notes of my impressions' ... [T]he trial judge made no statements of the kind just indicated, and no assumption in her favour that she had retained any relevant impressions could be made." [Emphasis added.]

95 I accept that the Tribunal's task in assessing credibility is often a difficult one. Having regard to the divergent views previously expressed about this appellant's credibility, the present case was no exception. T3 had to take particular care to ensure that it did not overlook the combined effect of delay, and the disadvantage to the appellant of having to repeat a detailed account of past mistreatment, when assessing the overall consistency of his account.

96 Both T1 and T2, as well as the delegate, seemed to have warned themselves appropriately of the need for appropriate caution when considering refugee claimants in unusual circumstances. T3 did nothing of the kind. Rather it undertook what seems to have been a detailed analysis of everything the appellant had previously said regarding his treatment in the Ukraine. It ultimately found five instances of supposed inconsistency. It extrapolated from these, together with one instance of a claim regarded as implausible, that the appellant was to be disbelieved in virtually everything he said.

97 Had the inconsistencies that T3 identified been both real and substantial, one might well understand how it arrived at its conclusion. Even then, it would have been highly desirable for T3 to have stated expressly that it had taken into account the dangers associated with drawing sweeping conclusions from what on any view was a mere handful of discrepancies.</text>
