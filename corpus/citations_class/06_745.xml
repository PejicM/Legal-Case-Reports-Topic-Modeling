<tocase>Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/652.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 26 May 2006, I dismissed a notice of motion dated 25 May 2006 by which the respondents sought orders discharging or staying an interlocutory injunction which I granted in these proceedings on 19 May 2006: Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652. I reserved the costs of the motion pending receipt of written submissions as to whether costs can or should be ordered in favour of the applicant, having regard to the provisions of s 824 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('WRA').

2 On 31 May 2006, the applicant and the respondents filed written submissions as to costs. Both parties have consented to me disposing of the question of costs without hearing further oral argument.</text>

<tocase>Bostik (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gorgevski (No 2) (1992) 36 FCR 439</tocase>
<text>3 It is common ground that the Court's jurisdiction in this proceeding arises because there are claims for final relief under the WRA. It follows that all of the claims in the proceeding are matters of federal jurisdiction. It also follows that the matter of costs is governed by s 824 of the WRA, both as to the statutory claim under the WRA and as to all claims in the Court's associated jurisdiction: Bostik (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gorgevski (No 2) (1992) 36 FCR 439.

4 Section 824 provides:
 
 '(1) A party to a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act (other than an application under section 663) must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first-mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. 
 
 (2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act (other than an application under section 663) is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs.'

5 Subsection (1) of s 824 was based upon an earlier provision in s 347(1) of the WRA: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth). It appears that subs (2) of s 824 was based upon the provision now found in s 666(1) of the WRA.</text>

<tocase>Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736</tocase>
<text>10 In Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 (' Shackley' ), a decision of the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Wilcox CJ held that the expression 'proceeding in a matter' in s 347(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) included a subsidiary application made in the course of the principal action: at 744. In the course of his reasons for decision, Wilcox CJ disagreed with the view expressed by Gray J in Andrews v Uniting Church in Australia Frontier Services (t/a Old Timers) (1995) 60 IR 437 (' Andrews ') at 441-442 that interlocutory motions ought not to be regarded as proceedings for the purposes of s 347. Wilcox CJ preferred the view expressed by Northrop J in Viner (Minister of State for Industrial Relations) v Australian Building Construction Employees' &amp; Builders Labourers' Federation (1981) 38 ALR 550 at 553 that 'proceeding' encompasses 'a step in the proceeding as well as the action itself'. Von Doussa J agreed with Wilcox CJ. The other member of the Full Bench, North J, did not express any view on the question whether the Court has power under s 347 to make orders for costs in interlocutory applications which are brought vexatiously or without reasonable cause: at 750.

11 In Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271 (' CFMEU '), the Full Court (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ) followed Shackley . The case concerned an interlocutory application by the Union for inspection of a document over which the Commonwealth claimed public interest immunity. The trial judge granted the application and ordered inspection, but the Commonwealth successfully appealed to the Full Court. The Commonwealth then sought an order that the Union pay the costs of the application and the appeal.

15 In Gray v Australian Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union (unreported, Marshall J, 26 June 1998), Marshall J also expressed the view, in reliance upon Andrews , that the reference to 'proceeding' in s 347(1) of the WRA is a reference to the substantive proceeding and not to a motion brought within the matter for the discharge or variation of an earlier order. I have also noted the discussion of Shackley and Andrews in Marshall J's judgment in Konrad v Victoria Police (1998) 78 IR 54 at 56-57. Both decisions by Marshall J predate the Full Court's decision in CFMEU. In my opinion, even if the views expressed by Marshall J were capable of standing with Shackley , which I respectfully doubt, they have been overtaken by the later Full Court decision. The law which I must apply is that stated by the Full Court in CFMEU.</text>

<tocase>Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213</tocase>
<text>13 The respondents' construction of s 824(1) was founded upon Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213 (' Woolworths' ). The case concerned the costs of a directions hearing at which the applicant advised the Court that it no longer wished to pursue its claim for interim relief to restrain the certification of an agreement under the WRA. The claim was not pursued because the agreement had in fact been certified after the institution of the proceedings but prior to the directions date, without the knowledge of the applicant. The respondent sought costs on the basis that the applicant had not mounted its interim application urgently and in accordance with the rules concerning the filing of affidavit evidence.

14 In the present case, the respondents relied on Nicholson J's statement at 214-215 [8] that the proviso to s 347(1) afforded no ground for making a costs order in respect of a step in the proceeding, as distinguished from the institution of the proceeding. However, it is not clear that the reference by Nicholson J to a 'step in the proceeding' was directed to the application for interim relief, rather than to particular procedural 'steps' in relation to that application. On my reading, Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding, as he went on to say at 214-215 [8] that:
 
 'the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and [was] one which remained, in the applicant's mind, reasonable throughout, until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement.' 
 

This simply amounts to a finding that, on the facts, costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s 347(1) because the interlocutory application was not instituted 'vexatiously or without reasonable cause'. In my opinion, Woolworths does not support the respondents' contention that costs cannot be awarded under 824(1) in respect of an interlocutory notice of motion.</text>

<text>18 In support of a narrow construction of s 824(2), the respondents referred me to several authorities that had considered the former provisions of s 170EHA, which effectively continued as s 170CS (now s 666 of the WRA): see Thomas v School of Mines Services Pty Ltd (unreported, Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Farrell JR, 5 August 1996); Turner v Composite Buyers Ltd (unreported, Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Millane JR, 28 January 1997) and Fenech v Perfect Health Medical Centres Pty Ltd (unreported, Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Ryan JR, 12 June 1998) (' Fenech' ). These cases do not support the contention that s 824(2) should be narrowly construed. In fact, in Fenech , Ryan JR referred to an earlier order made by Marshall J in the proceedings, to the effect that the respondent should pay costs pursuant to s 170EHA as a result of the dismissal of its application for an interlocutory injunction.</text>

<tocase>Standish v University of Tasmania (1989) 28 IR 129</tocase>
<text>22 My reasons for judgment of 26 May 2006 explain why I rejected the application to discharge the interlocutory injunction. In my opinion, the application had very limited prospects of success in the absence of evidence establishing new facts or changed circumstances. There is, however, a distinction between an application that proves unsuccessful and an application or argument that is so misconceived that it can be characterised as unreasonable or vexatious. An order for costs might be made under s 824 in the latter case but not the former: see Standish v University of Tasmania (1989) 28 IR 129 at 138-139 per Lockhart J; and Foxcroft v Ink Group Pty Ltd (1994) 57 IR 65 at 69. This case comes very close to the line, but in the end I am not persuaded that the motion was vexatious or unreasonable within the meaning of s 842(1), or that the pursuit of the motion involved unreasonable acts or omissions by the respondents that inflicted costs on the applicant in such a way as to attract s 824(2).</text>
