<tocase>Agar v Hyde [2000] HCA 41 ; (2000) 201 CLR 552</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/41.html</AustLII>
<text>33 Because of the transitional provisions introducing s 31A into the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the test in that section for summary dismissal of causes of action cannot be applied on the present application. For the purposes of determining fair arguability, rather, I must have regard to the line of authority exemplified in Sir Garfield Barwick CJ's judgment in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125, particularly at 129-130. Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Agar v Hyde [2000] HCA 41 ; (2000) 201 CLR 552 at 576 [57] :
 
 'The test to be applied has been expressed in various ways, but all of the verbal formulae which have been used are intended to describe a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceeding if it were to be allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way.'

34 I am satisfied on the material before me that there is a high degree of certainty this amendment would not be able to succeed as pleaded and ought not to be allowed to go to trial. Other factors which have induced me to come to this conclusion are as follow. The discussions that Mr Sukkar said occurred with the bank officers did not take place in circumstances where it might be expected, ordinarily, that reasonable persons in the position of the parties or Mr Sukkar himself would regard the bank as giving him financial advice, as opposed to simply putting forward the bank's position, even if that position were being put perhaps forcefully or determinedly.

53 It is important to plead material facts in order to identify what is alleged will be the essential matters to be proved to establish a party's legal right to relief or resist the grant of relief to the opponent. Under the judicature system of pleading, such as is maintained in this Court, there is no necessity to assert or identify a legal category of action or suit which the facts asserted may illustrate, involve or demonstrate and on which the particular relief claimed is based or to which it is relevant: Agar v Hyde 201 CLR at 577-578 [64]. The essentiality of pleading the material facts, as opposed to even pleading a statute pursuant to which relief might be claimed, was emphasised recently in Agtrack (NT) Pty Ltd v Hatfield [2005] HCA 38 ; (2005) 223 CLR 251 at 264-265 [38] - [40] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; and see also Air Link Pty Ltd v Paterson (2005) 223 CLR 283 at 298-299 [25]-[32].</text>

<tocase>Brickfield Properties Ltd v Newton [1971] 1 WLR 862</tocase>
<text>65 As ASS pointed out, there are departures in that rule from similar, but differently worded, rules in other courts. But it has relied on a construction of O 13 r 2(1) based on what Sachs LJ said in Brickfield Properties Ltd v Newton [1971] 1 WLR 862 esp at 874-875; [1971] 3 All ER 328 at 337-338. The approach which ASS urged in accordance with the approach of Sachs LJ in Brickfield [1971] 1 WLR 862; [1971] 3 All ER 328 is that r 2(1) creates a plenary power to amend. However, Edmund-Davies and Cross LJJ expressed considerable doubts about Sachs LJ's approach to the English rule, which was cast in somewhat similar terms to O 13 r 2(1). ASS said that the power ought not be read down by reference to the commencing words of the rule, 'Subject to the following provisions of this rule'.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finding [2001] 1 Qd R 168</tocase>
<text>36 On a number of occasions the courts have considered claims in which bankers have been sought to be made into fiduciaries of their customers. Recently, in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finding [2001] 1 Qd R 168 the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered a case in which a bank was in the position of being a mortgagee exercising power of sale as well as being financier of the purchaser. The Court held that no fiduciary duty to the incoming purchaser arose in the bank on the facts in that case. In coming to that conclusion they referred to a number of authorities in this Court, the High Court and elsewhere. They pointed out that in other cases where a relationship of a fiduciary nature between banker and customer arose, the bank had assumed the role of financial adviser, or perhaps had brought parties together, and the customer had placed complete faith and confidence in the adviser, as one would expect in a fiduciary relationship. In a passage quoted with approval by the Court of Appeal in Finding [2001] 1 Qd R at 172, Hill J had said in Golby v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1996) 72 FCR 134 at 136:
 
 'It is not a critical feature of a banker/customer relationship that the banker undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of its customer in the exercise of some power or discretion affecting the interests of the customer in a legal or practical sense. Absent therefore some special feature, such as the giving of advice in Smith [42 FCR 390], there is no reason to erect a fiduciary relationship between bank and customer when that relationship is essentially one founded in contract.'

38 And as Davies and Pincus JJA with Derrington J pointed out in Finding [2001] 1 Qd R at 173-174 [13], there was no evidence in that case of reliance upon the advice of the bank in relation to the transaction, nor was there evidence of the customers holding any expectation that the bank would disclose the relevant information or that it had assumed the role of adviser to the customers. Here the proposed amendment does not make any allegation of reliance by ASS upon the advice given by either Messrs Burrowes or Bingham in relation to interest rates, timing of finance or the quality of the terms proposed by the bank. In those circumstances, the proposed pleading does not reveal a cause of action that I regard as fairly arguable.

39 I would also observe in passing that, unlike what had happened in the cases to which I have referred, much of what was pleaded as material which the bank ought to have disclosed suggested that, had disclosure been made, the proposition of dealing with Akyman would have appeared even better from ASS's point of view than it had on what ASS already knew. Although the bank had made its own internal estimates as to how profitable the business was likely to be, based on the sales projections which it had been given by Akyman, it is likely that much of that material had been already provided to ASS by the same source (Akyman) in one form or another, albeit it is possible that it may not have provided all of it. In any event, these observations do not affect the matter because, if there were a duty to disclose, the bank would have had to discharge its obligation to give a proper disclosure.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1991) 42 FCR 390</tocase>
<text>24 In Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1991) 42 FCR 390 at 391 Davies, Sheppard and Gummow JJ looked at a situation in which a bank was held to have entered into a fiduciary relationship with its customer. Their Honours noted that it was not a novel proposition, where a bank gave a customer advice upon financial affairs, that in addition to any contractual rights the customer may have, the relationship between the parties may be such as to found either a breach of a common law duty of care or a breach of a fiduciary duty. And they said that in many cases the bank as financier would have a manifest personal interest of its own in the matter.

25 They said that the question then became one of ascertaining whether, given the apparent commercial self-interest of the bank, it also could be taken to have assumed a fiduciary responsibility towards the customer in question, and emphasised that the context and factual settings were critical in that regard. Their Honours said that a bank could be expected to act in its own interests in ensuring the security of its position as a lender to its customer ( Smith 42 FCR at 391):
 

 
 '... but it may have created in the customer the expectation that nevertheless it will advise in the customer's interests as to the wisdom of a proposed investment. This may be the case where the customer may fairly take it that to a significant extent his interest is consistent with that of the bank in financing the customer for a prudent business venture. In such a way the bank may become fiduciary and occupy the position of what Brennan J has called "an investment adviser"; Daly v Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 at 384-385.'

26 Their Honours went on to emphasise that the case before them was not one where one would properly describe the parties as acting in a commercial transaction at arm's length and each with the assistance of fully independent professional advice ( Smith 42 FCR at 392).

27 I am of opinion that the evidence before me on this application has every characteristic of a transaction of the latter description. This involved a business proposition that was being considered by ASS and its principals over a period. They had the assistance of fully independent professional advice from their solicitors, Bruce &amp; Stewart. In his affidavits, Mr Sukkar noted disclosures that the bank and also Akyman had made, to some degree, at the times when Bruce &amp; Stewart were advising first him and Mr Barrow and, later, ASS. There was also some further disclosure to ASS because its consent had to be given to the relationship agreement between the bank and Akyman.</text>

<tocase>Gray v New Augarita Porcupine Mines Ltd [1952] 3 DLR 1</tocase>
<text>28 The matters alleged to have been relevant for the bank to disclose, again, have features which suggest that much of this material could be taken to have been known to ASS or its principals during the course of the relationship. Of course, the mere fact that ASS had some knowledge is not an answer to a claim of breach of fiduciary duty. In order to discharge his or her duty the fiduciary must disclose fully and frankly the nature and extent of any conflict between his or her duty and or interest and the interest of the person to whom the fiduciary owes the duty. As Lord Radcliffe said in giving the advice of the Judicial Committee in Gray v New Augarita Porcupine Mines Ltd [1952] 3 DLR 1 at 14 of a director's duty to disclose to the company's board:
 
 'The amount of detail required must depend in each case upon the nature of the contract or arrangement proposed and the context in which it arises. It can rarely be enough for a director to say "I must remind you that I am interested" and to leave it at that, unless there is some special provision in a company's articles that makes such a general warning sufficient. His declaration must make his colleagues "fully informed of the real state of things" (see Imperial Mercantile Credit Ass'n v Coleman (1873), LR 6 HL 189 at p 201, per Lord Chelmsford). If it is material to their judgment that they should know not merely that he has an interest, but what it is and how far it goes, then he must see to it that they are informed (see Lord Cairns in the same case at p 205).'</text>

<text>29 And, Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449 at 466 (footnote omitted) (which was approved by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 at [107] ):
 
 'What is required for a fully informed consent is a question of fact in all the circumstances of each case and there is no precise formula which will determine in all cases if fully informed consent has been given.'

40 The sufficiency of disclosure by a fiduciary can depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom it is made, so that it can truly be said that his or her consent is fully informed. That is a question of fact in all cases ( Farah Constructions [2007] HCA 22 at [107] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ). Because I am of opinion that no fiduciary obligation arose, it is irrelevant for me to consider the question of sufficiency of disclosure in the context of whether the proposed amendment is fairly arguable (cf: Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at 198-199 [77] - [79] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).</text>

<tocase>McGee v Yeomans [1977] 1 NSWLR 273</tocase>
<text>66 I am of opinion that the commencing words of r 2(1) which I have just quoted demonstrate that the power of the Court in r 2(1), in the ordinary and natural meaning of the rule, must be read as being constrained by matters referred to in the rest of O 13 r 2. These words make O 13 r 2 operate differently to rules such as those considered in cases like McGee v Yeomans [1977] 1 NSWLR 273 at 279G where Glass JA observed that the general power of amendment under the New South Wales rules ( Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) Pt 20 r 1(1)) was not made subject to the other parts of the same rule, and that another part of that rule (SCR Pt 20 r 4(7)) expressly provided that those parts did not limit the general power to allow amendments under SCR Pt 20 r 1(1) (cf: Charles Church Developments Ltd v Stent Foundations Ltd [2007] 1 WLR 1203).

67 That might not be the end of the argument because ASS also pointed to O 13 r 2(2). There is certainly also a plenary character to the grant of power in that rule. But it falls to be considered here, having regard to the question whether the interests of justice operate to allow the filling of a gap which would have the consequence of overcoming an expired limitation period. In that respect, the qualification in the commencing words of O 13 r 2(1) and other parts of the rule in O 13 r 2 are relevant. Order 13 r 2 subrr (3) to (7) deal expressly with applications to the Court for leave to make amendments:
 
 
 &#8226; to correct mistakes in the name or identity of the party;
 &#8226; to substitute one party for another where such a mistake needs correction;
 &#8226; to alter the capacity in which a party is said to be suing; or
 &#8226; to add a new claim for relief or foundation in law for a claim for relief provided that it arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as those already pleaded to support an existing claim for relief by the party applying for the amendment.

68 Each of those subrules and the framing of subr (3) in itself evince an intention to allow the correction of mistakes or the addition of a legal formulation of a claim for relief, but not to add previously omitted material facts necessary to complete the pleading of an existing cause of action. And subr (9) expressly provides that an amendment would not be permitted which would have an effect inconsistent with a statute of limitation in matters arising under subrr (7)(b) and (8).</text>

<tocase>Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The first question which needs to be determined, in the application to amend, is whether the proposed pleading raises a cause of action which is fairly arguable. I have taken this formulation from the reasons of Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 154-155. They said that if a matter were fairly arguable then, ordinarily, the party seeking to amend ought to be permitted to argue it, provided that any prejudice to the other side might be compensated by costs. Kirby J, in concurring, also pointed to other prejudices and considerations which may inform a proper exercise of the discretion to permit amendment ( JL Holdings 189 CLR at 170-171).

20 The first representation said to give rise to the expectation pleaded in paragraph 21D came out of the conversation between Mr Burrowes of the bank and Mr Sukkar. Mr Burrowes said that it would be the quickest and best way to proceed, they would be the best rates that he would be able to give and that the application then being discussed would be the quickest way to procure finance.

21 The second representation on which the expectation in paragraph 21D was said to have been raised arose out of a conversation with Mr Bingham. The evidence before me is that he is no longer an officer of the bank, his whereabouts are not known and he was not previously considered to be a person who would be a witness in the proceedings. Mr Sukkar says that Mr Bingham told him over the telephone that the issue of interest rates was raised and Mr Bingham said that the rates then discussed would be the best that Mr Sukkar would be able to achieve. And, at a later time, he said that he wanted ASS, in effect, to proceed quickly in order for Mr Nicolau or Akyman to be satisfied that ASS could raise the funds and proceed with a letter of credit. Mr Bingham was also claimed to have said that they were the best interest rates he would be able to give to the applicants.

44 In JL Holdings 189 CLR at 154-155 Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to considerations of case management as having a relevance, albeit that they should not in the ordinary course outweigh the ultimate need for the Court to do justice between the parties. Likewise, I am of opinion that part of the balance in which justice between the parties in the present application is to be viewed, is the fact that these proceedings have been on foot for six years and involve events that took place over 10 years ago, among other events. The allegations involve quite new claims and matters in the context of the existing pleadings and extensive affidavits. These related to conversations of which Mr Sukkar has been well aware at all times, since he was a party to them when they occurred (see too Jeans v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (2003) 204 ALR 327 at 334 [32] per Hill, Madgwick and Conti JJ).

45 ASS submitted that some of the material in the documents newly discovered by the bank alerted those advising ASS to the possibility of this claim. But that is not a statement that anyone has made on oath nor has it been tested. I have been asked to infer that that is the case. An amendment of this significance, if granted, would require the bank to review the whole of its case and the way in which its relationship with ASS developed and proceeded in the first half of 1997. I am not satisfied that this task could fairly be undertaken by the bank in a short time. This would mean that the bank would have to find and interview witnesses as well as to subpoena documents from others. It includes the possibility that it would have to find Mr Bingham, its former officer, if he is still able to give evidence and if he has any recollection of the events so long afterwards. It is not suggested by ASS that there are any bank manager's diary notes evidencing any of the three conversations relied on so that, at the moment, there is no contemporaneous record of the conversations upon which anyone can rely. It may be that the bank is able to do a search within its own records and discover those, but the evidence before me indicates that it is likely that in the ordinary course those documents that have not been the subject of discovery could have been destroyed by now, although no search, at the moment, has been undertaken. I have had regard to the possibility that new documents could be located.

46 But even then it may be necessary to subpoena others, such as, for example, Bruce &amp; Stewart. Again, I must have regard to the likelihood that documents which that firm had at the time may now have been destroyed, since some of the applicable limitation periods applying to its dealings with ASS and its principals have since expired, albeit that there is a potential for some causes of action to have remained, such as those depending on damage occurring quite some time after the transactions.

47 All these matters suggest to me that there could be substantial delays in the further hearing of the matter with possibilities of real prejudice to the bank. Moreover, the evidence before me indicates the value of the bank's security is in the order of about $1.5 million less than its claimed debt. There is no evidence from ASS as to its current financial position or its ability to meet any such difference. In JL Holdings 189 CLR at 154 Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to the fact that if the case was fairly arguable then the party seeking the amendment should be permitted to pursue it '... provided that any prejudice to [the other side] might be compensated by costs'.

48 On the evidence, before me, I am not satisfied that there is any real prospect of the bank being compensated by costs in this case were it ultimately to be successful. Indeed, I am satisfied that the bank is likely to suffer a substantial shortfall in the realisation of any security should it succeed in these and the related proceedings in enforcing those securities and recovering judgment against ASS and the guarantors of ASS. In those circumstances it would be an empty mantra for the Court to say simply that an order for costs would be sufficient. ASS's senior counsel indicated during argument that, if its application were granted, attempts would be made to provide evidence of its ability to pay or provide security for $40,000 in a manner satisfactory to the Court to secure the bank's costs thrown away, together with the value of the 10 days' interest on the outstanding moneys claimed by the bank (about $15,000).

49 I am not satisfied that this security would compensate the bank against the prejudice an amendment would occasion. This is not merely because of the bank's loss of the opportunity to have a hearing that has now been fixed to commence this week for over six months. The prospect is that that hearing will be delayed further. In the meantime the shortfall in value of the bank's securities would be likely to increase. In the circumstances I am of opinion that the cause of action sought to be raised by the amendment is not sufficiently strong as to warrant the exercise of my discretion, balancing all the interests of the parties as best I can on the material before me, so as to conclude that it is in the interests of justice to allow the amendment.

50 The second basis on which the application to amend has been contested is that ASS wishes to plead its reliance upon the six representations to which I have referred. The proposed pleading refers to a number of activities which ASS is said to have undertaken in reliance upon the six representations.

51 There is a dispute between the parties as to whether or not the evidence currently filed supports or answers those aspects of reliance. But, it is accepted by ASS that other than two paragraphs in the amended statement of claim, no material facts are pleaded at present which would be sufficient as instances on which ASS could be found to have relied on any of the six representations. ASS pointed to pars 55 and 56 of the amended statement of claim. They alleged that, first, on 11 March 1999 the bank proposed to ASS and Akyman that sales of the EFTPOS product cease until such time as particular identified problems with it were rectified, and, secondly, on 15 March 1999 Akyman responded by telling the bank that its proposal would be addressed by an upgrade to the third release of the product. But those allegations appear to be ones involving activity by Akyman, not by ASS.

54 Here, as ASS accepted at the outset of its argument, the facts pleaded in the amended statement of claim in respect of the six representations required an allegation of reliance in order to complete the essential elements of a cause of action under s 82. But, the pleading omitted any allegation that any of the six misrepresentations caused ASS to do or refrain from doing anything (cf: Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525, 527 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). Accordingly, the facts pleaded in the current amended statement of claim do not disclose a basis upon which relief might be granted. Hence ASS seeks an amendment to assert the material facts in respect of its reliance.

55 It follows that as the amended statement of claim currently stands, it does not plead, as ASS accepted, a cause of action under s 82(1) of the Act in respect of the six representations to which the new amendments are directed.

56 If ASS were to attempt today to plead for the first time any such cause of action, it would be outside any applicable limitation period under s 82(2) of the Act. That provides that a cause of action under s 82(1) may be commenced at any time within six years after the day on which the cause of action that related to the conduct accrued. No suggestion was made in argument that the causes of action on each of the six representations had not accrued at least by some time in 2004. This has had the consequence that if I do not grant this amendment, the causes of action cannot be retrieved.

61 Of course there will be cases in which material facts have already been pleaded that demonstrate that a remedy not already sought should be allowed to be sought or that some expansion of the circumstances relied on as material facts may be permitted because they are, in substance, fairly pleaded already. But there are also considerations of policy behind the enactment of statutes of limitations, as the judgment of McHugh J in Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25 ; (1996) 186 CLR 541 at 551-554 demonstrates with clarity. In a case like the present the effect of delay on the quality of justice may be seen to be an important factor in the legislative choice of the six year limitation period in s 82(2) of the Act.

62 Here I think it is fairly safe to infer an oversight has occurred in the pleading of the amended statement of claim which the proposed amendment now seeks to rectify. In JL Holdings 189 CLR at 154-155, 170-171 the Court was mindful that amendments to rectify such oversights ought ordinarily to be granted if they can be done without injustice to the other party. The question here is whether an injustice will be done by taking away from the bank the protection that the limitation period in s 82(2) may have given it against a cause of action incompletely alleged against it. The pleading of the causes of action based on each of the six representations in issue here, as currently on the record of the Court, will result in the action failing because of the absence of any allegation of the material fact of ASS's reliance.

63 I am of opinion that permitting an amendment which would take away from a party a substantive defence granted by legislation, in circumstances where there is no direct procedural rule supporting the grant of an amendment, is capable of causing injustice within the concepts discussed in JL Holdings [1997] HCA 1 ; 189 CLR 146 and the cases to which that decision refers.

64 However, ASS has relied on the provisions of O 13 r 2. That provides:
 
 '2 General 
 
 
 
 
 (1) Subject to the following provisions of this rule, the Court may, at any stage of any proceeding, order that any document in the proceeding be amended, or that any party have leave to amend any document in the proceeding, in either case in such manner as the Court thinks fit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding, or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings. 
 
 (3) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in subrules (4), (5) or (6) or paragraph (7) (a) is made after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of commencement of the proceeding has expired, the Court may, nevertheless, grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that subrule if it thinks it is just to do so. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (4) Where there has been a mistake in the name or identity of a party, an amendment to correct the name of the party may be made notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is to substitute another person as a party. 
 
 (5) Where an order to correct a mistake in the name of a party has the effect of substituting another person as a party, the proceeding shall be taken to have commenced with respect to that person on the day the proceeding commenced. 
 
 (6) An amendment to alter the capacity in which a party sues may be made if the new capacity is one which that party had at the date of the commencement of the proceeding or has since acquired. 
 
 (7) An amendment may be made even if the effect of the amendment is to add a new claim for relief or foundation in law for a claim for relief (whether by way of substitution for an existing claim for relief or foundation in law or not) if the new claim for relief or foundation in law: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as those already pleaded to support an existing claim for relief by the party applying for leave to make the amendment; or 
 
 (b) subject to subrule (9), arises, in whole or in part, out of facts or matters that have occurred or arisen since the commencement of the proceeding. 
 
 
 
 
 (8) Subject to subrule (9), an amendment of a pleading may be made even if the amendment pleads a fact or matter that has occurred or arisen since the commencement of the proceeding.

<tocase>Truebit Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1997] FCA 1290 (unreported 27 November 1997)</tocase>

<text>37 The Queensland Court of Appeal also quoted with approval what Branson J had said in Truebit Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1997] FCA 1290 at p 28. Her Honour set out the following passage from Meagher RP, Gummow WMC and Lehane JRF, Equity: Doctrines and Remedies (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1992) at pp 130-131, which read:
 
 'The distinguishing characteristic of a fiduciary relationship is that its essence, or purpose, is to serve exclusively the interests of a person or group of persons; or, to put it negatively, it is a relationship in which the parties are not each free to pursue their separate interests.' 


Her Honour then continued:
 
 
 'There is thus an inconsistency between the notion of Westpac assuming a fiduciary duty to the applicants in respect of its treatment of their application for finance and the maintenance of Westpac's "own commercial self interest as lender". Moreover, there is a commercial, and possibly conceptual, unreality surrounding the contention that Westpac was entitled to consider the applicants' application for finance both in the applicants' interest and in Westpac's own interest as the proposed lender to the applicants, but not in Westpac's interest as the mortgagee/lender exercising through a receiver the power of sale in respect of [the property].'</text>
