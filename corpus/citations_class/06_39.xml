<text>5 I am satisfied that leave should be granted to raise the ground. It is based on the reasons for decision of the RRT and on the material before the FMC, does not involve the adducing of any further evidence and does not cause injustice or unfairness to the respondents. Furthermore, in view of the conclusions at which I have arrived, it is clearly in the interests of justice that the leave sought be granted: cf Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 438 [34] - [35] per Allsop J (with whom Drummond and Mansfield JJ agreed).

6 The appellant's claim before the RRT was that she fears persecution if she returns to Turkey because she is on a PKK blacklist because of her husband's activities in the Special Forces against PKK members ('the blacklist claim'). As the RRT accepted that the appellant had a subjective fear of persecution as she claimed, it was bound to determine whether that claim fell within the Convention. One aspect of that determination was whether the subjective fear of persecution held by the appellant by reason of the blacklist claim was well founded. Another aspect was whether the fear of persecution held by the appellant was for reasons of an actual or imputed political opinion or as a member of a particular social group being that she is a person on a PKK blacklist or she is the wife of a person on a PKK blacklist. On a fair reading of the decision of the RRT, the claim considered by it was a different claim, namely whether a fear of persecution held by a member of the armed forces or as a family member of a member of the armed forces was well founded. This is apparent from the way in which the RRT expressed its decision and from the country information upon which it relied.</text>

<tocase>Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>7 This case is analogous to Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 (' Dranichnikov '). In that case, the applicant claimed to be a member of a social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals. However, the RRT considered whether the applicant was at risk of persecution by reason of his membership of a social group consisting of businessmen in Russia. The majority in the High Court (Gummow and Callinan JJ, with whom Hayne J agreed) found at 394-5 [27] that the RRT had fallen into jurisdictional error by determining: 
 
 'whether Mr Dranichnikov's membership of a social group, namely of "businessmen in Russia" was a reason for his persecution and relevantly nothing more.' 
 
 
 The majority held that: 
 
 
 'The tribunal should have decided the matter which was put to it, whether Mr Dranichnikov was a member of a social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals.' 

Kirby J reached the same conclusion as Gummow, Callinan and Hayne JJ and observed at 407 [87]-[88]:
 
 'Difficult as it may sometimes be to differentiate jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional error with exactitude, in a case where there has been a fundamental mistake at the threshold in expressing, and therefore considering, the legal claim propounded by an applicant, the error will be classified as an error of jurisdiction. It will be treated as a constructive failure of the decision-maker to exercise the jurisdiction and powers given to it. 
 
 Obviously, it is not every mistake in understanding the facts, in applying the law or in reasoning to a conclusion that will amount to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. But where, as here, the mistake is essentially definitional and amounts to a basic misunderstanding of the case brought by an applicant, the resulting flaw is so serious as to undermine the lawfulness of the decision in question in a fundamental way.'

8 The first respondent argued that there was no jurisdictional error by the RRT because the RRT determined the risk of harm to a more general social group, the armed forces, a subset of which was members of the armed forces on a PKK blacklist. However, I am satisfied that in this case, as in Dranichnikov , the RRT was required, but failed, to consider and make findings in respect of the claim made by the appellant and instead made findings in relation to a different claim which was not the claim put by the appellant. This constitutes a failure by the RRT to exercise its jurisdiction.

9 The first respondent contended in the alternative that the appellant must fail in any event because the RRT made an independent finding of adequate state protection. However, the RRT's finding of adequate state protection related to the claim with which it was dealing, namely the threat likely to be experienced by members of the Turkish armed forces and their families. As explained above, that was not the appellant's claim. The question of whether a person in the appellant's position was able to obtain adequate protection from the Turkish authorities was not addressed by the RRT. I am confirmed in that view by the fact that the RRT made no reference in its state protection finding to the claim of the appellant that the Turkish authorities stated they could only provide her with protection for three months but no longer. The failure to deal with that specific claim, which was plainly relevant to the issue of adequate state protection for the appellant or for persons in her position, supports my view that the RRT was dealing with a different claim. It follows that the appeal is to be allowed and the orders of McInnis FM are to be set aside. Orders should also be made quashing the decision of the RRT and requiring it to determine the appellant's application according to law.
 

 I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Merkel.
