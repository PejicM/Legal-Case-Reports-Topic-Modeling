<text>15 The leading case in this area of law is the decision of the High Court of Australia in The State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146. In that case, the trial judge accepted an explanation by the respondents to the substantive proceedings for the delay in making application for leave to amend the defence, however refused the application to amend the defence on the basis, inter alia , that the amendments would jeopardise the hearing dates, and would have the result that the matter would be unlikely to be relisted until the following year. In allowing the respondent's appeal, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ held:
 
 "Sali v SPC Ltd was a case concerning the refusal of an adjournment in relation to which the proper principles of case management may have a particular relevance. However, nothing in that case suggests that those principles might be employed, except perhaps in extreme circumstances, to shut a party out from litigating an issue which is fairly arguable. Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim." (at 154)

16 Later in their judgment, their Honours continued:
 
 "Justice is the paramount consideration in determining an application such as the one in question. Save in so far as costs may be awarded against the party seeking the amendment, such an application is not the occasion for the punishment of a party for its mistake or for its delay in making the application. Case management, involving as it does the efficiency of the procedures of the court, was in this case a relevant consideration. But it should not have been allowed to prevail over the injustice of shutting the applicants out from raising an arguable defence, thus precluding the determination of an issue between the parties." (at 155)

17 Kirby J in JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; 189 CLR 146 also observed :
 
 "Among considerations which may tend to favour the extension of an indulgence to a paty applying for it are the following : that this is the only way in which the true issues and the real merits, factual and legal, can be litigated and artificiality avoided; that the oversight which occurred is adequately explained....; that any fault is that of the party's legal representatives; that the oversight was wholly accident; that it was simply the product of unavoidable human error.... Departures from a court ordered timetable, whilst relevant, are not decisive. Such orders are servants of justice. They are designed to enhance its achievement in a way that an inflexible application of rigid rules could prevent. Efficiency in the dispatch of court lists can sometimes be purchased at too high a price...." (at 169-170).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/425.html</AustLII>
<text>18 In addition to this authority, relevant decisions in relation to this application include the following :
 
1. In Jarrett v Westpac Banking Corporation [1999] FCA 425 , the Full Court held that the withdrawal of, or change of, legal representation shortly before a hearing will not necessarily or routinely give rise to a situation where the Court should permit the trial dates to be vacated (particularly Mansfield J at [87]). In that case, however, the Court allowed an appeal from a single judge refusing an adjournment, in circumstances where the respondents would have had no legal representation at the trial if the trial had proceeded
 
2. in Robinson v Aware Industries Ltd (unreported Weinberg J, 1 October 1998) Weinberg J noted that it was common ground between the parties in that case that, given the fact that the new solicitors and counsel for the applicant had only just been retained, it would be inappropriate and unfair to the applicant, as well as the respondents, to require the trial to proceed. His Honour ordered that the existing trial dates be vacated and a new trial date be fixed. However his Honour also ordered that, in the circumstances, the applicant pay the costs thrown away by reason of the need to vacate the trial date, on an indemnity basis
 
3. in Business in Focus (Aust) Pty Ltd v Begun Property Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 264 , in view of the prejudice the respondents would have suffered in this case if the trial had proceeded because of engagement of new solicitors shortly before the trial after a period of inactivity by their previous legal advisors, I ordered that the trial dates be vacated and any costs thrown away by the respondents as a result of the vacation of the trial date be borne by the applicants
 
4. in Menzies v CRCI Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 118 , where the application for vacation of the trial was made on the first day of the trial, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that: 
 
 "where an amendment would require vacation of a trial hearing date which was set to take place within a few days, generally there is prejudice through prolongation of the litigation that is not entirely met by costs, and the imposition of that prejudice on the other party needs to be justified by the strength of the case made for the indulgence by the party applying for it."
