<tocase>Abigroup Ltd v Abignano (1992) 112 ALR 497</tocase>
<text>6 In my view there is power to make the order sought. It has always been accepted that a court retains jurisdiction after final judgment to deal with matters involved in or arising in the course of the operation of the court's order. If the need to deal with an order is foreseen the order usually reserves liberty to apply. At any rate a court has inherent power to deal with such matters. That a court retains the ability to deal with matters arising out of its orders does not permit it to grant substantive relief of a kind not originally sought in the proceeding or which is substantially different from that given by the final order: Phillips v Walsh (1990) 20 NSWLR 206, 209. Indeed, reservation of liberty to apply is usually confined to "questions of machinery which may arise from the implementation of a court's orders": Abigroup Ltd v Abignano (1992) 112 ALR 497, 509. But it is not limited to matters of machinery. A court can make a variety of orders provided what is involved does not undermine the finality of the orders already made: Penrice v Williams (1883) 23 Ch D 353.</text>
