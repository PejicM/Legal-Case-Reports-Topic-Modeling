<tocase>Air Great Lakes Pty Ltd v K S Easter (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 309</tocase>
<text>179 In Air Great Lakes Pty Ltd v K S Easter (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 309 Mahoney J adopted a threefold enquiry in determining whether a binding contract had been concluded between the parties. His Honour said that it would be of assistance to distinguish between three questions: 
 
 
 &#8226; Did the parties arrive at a consensus?
 &#8226; If they did, was it such a consensus as was capable of forming a binding contract?
 &#8226; And, if it was, did the parties intend that the consensus at which they arrived should constitute a binding contract?</text>

<text>158 The case which an applicant presents must support the case which that applicant has pleaded. If the evidence supports a different case an application should be made to amend the pleadings to bring them into line with the facts as proved.

<tocase>Macdonald v Australian Wool Innovation Ltd [2005] FCA 105</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/105.html</AustLII>
<text>176 I discussed a number of these cases in Macdonald v Australian Wool Innovation Ltd [2005] FCA 105 at [206] [209] and [211] [229]. That case concerned two senior scientists who left their employ with a large public company because they were offered the opportunity to engage in a high risk, but high reward, venture with the respondent. They claimed they had entered into an agreement with the respondent which was binding and legally efficacious, but that the respondent had repudiated that agreement. The respondent denied that any such agreement had been concluded.

177 I held that the applicants had established the existence of the binding agreement pleaded. The board of the respondent, a public company, had specifically considered and approved a detailed and documented proposal for the particular venture. Not all the "i"s were dotted and not all the "t"s crossed. However, the critical elements had all been agreed, and those that were not expressly agreed would readily be the subject of implication.

178 The present case is a far cry from Macdonald . Even on Mr Quinlan's case a number of essential terms were uncertain or lacking. Alternatively, if those terms are not regarded as "essential", they were terms of the kind that would ordinarily be expected to be agreed in a complex agreement involving major property developments and potentially large amounts of money. I refer in particular to matters such as:
 
 
 &#8226; the funding arrangements that would be put in place to support the venture, ie to purchase and develop properties;
 &#8226; the duration of the venture;
 &#8226; how and when profits would be distributed; and
 &#8226; the exact terms upon which the $500,000 would be paid, if called upon.</text>

<tocase>Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/52.html</AustLII>
<text>181 Even accepting Mr Quinlan's account of the relevant conversations, he has not established that the parties arrived at a consensus. If they did, it was not a consensus that was capable of forming a binding contract. And, if it was, viewed objectively, in accordance with Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] , the parties did not intend that the consensus at which they arrived should constitute a binding contract.

182 In arriving at that conclusion, I have given weight to the fact that the discussions between the parties concerned major property developments. It would have been plain to Mr Quinlan that any venture of the type he contemplated would have required millions of dollars in finance. The arrangement that he asserts could never have gotten off the ground without the Brady interests being prepared to contribute large amounts of money. Mr Quinlan had no significant assets, and no capacity to borrow even relatively modest amounts of money.

183 I have also given weight to the fact that, at the relevant time, Mr Quinlan and Mr Brady were barely acquaintances. This was not a handshake deal done between longstanding business associates, where perhaps some latitude in relation to formality might be accorded.</text>

<tocase>Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106</tocase>
<text>167 A particularly helpful statement of the relevant legal principles is to be found in Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106. The issue in that case was whether a binding agreement had been made in December 1990 between two Toyota companies, and the respondent, for a rescue package, the respondent having been in financial difficulties for some months. The negotiations resulted in a letter dated 19 December 1990 which, together with a one page enclosure referred to the "now agreed to conditions". The respondent claimed that Mr Morgan had telephoned a senior Toyota official shortly after receipt of the letter, and accepted the offer contained in it.

168 It was important to note that the enclosure, which contained the details of the rescue package, set out various conditions relating to the offer, a timetable under which those conditions had to be met, and a statement to the effect that if the financial position indicated that the Ken Morgan group could not be viable even after the current offer was concluded, Toyota would not proceed with that offer.

169 The trial judge held that a binding agreement was made in December 1990, the terms of which were set out in the letter and the enclosure. On appeal, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria overturned that finding.</text>
