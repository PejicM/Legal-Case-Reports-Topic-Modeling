<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd (2009) 71 ACSR 640</tocase>
<text>In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd (2009) 71 ACSR 640 (WPS Motorsport), I had occasion to consider a number of authorities bearing upon the question for immediate determination: see paras 20 - 23 of the reasons for judgment in that case, in particular.

Since the winding up application was filed, the Deputy Commissioner has determined an objection to the substantive underlying revenue law debt arising from default assessment. It emerges from the affidavit of debt of Mr Gregory Phillips, read on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner, that on or about 19 October 2009 an objection was allowed against Bedroff's income tax assessment for the year ended 30 June 2005. The result of that objection decision was that Bedroff's taxation liability for the 2005 year was reduced by $813,063.22, with related penalty being reduced by $609,797.42.

As yet, and perhaps surprisingly, the Deputy Commissioner has not yet taken steps to implement that objection decision by the issuing of an appropriate amended assessment. The evidence, though, is that when that amended assessment is issued, the present indebtedness of the company to the Commonwealth, which has risen a little as a result of the running of general interest charge, will be reduced by $1,422,860.64. On any view, though, what remains is a substantial debt to the Commonwealth.</text>

<text>In WPS Motorsport I was faced with a question as to whether, on the evidence to hand, I was satisfied that it was in the interests of the creditors to the company for the winding up application to be adjourned. The evidence put forward on behalf of the company, there to give rise such satisfaction, was, when one analysed it, illusory. That is not this case. While the evidence is certainly of a general nature, it does enliven, in my opinion, sentiments of the kind voiced by Philip McMurdo J in Re Octaviar Ltd (formerly MFS Ltd) (2009) 69 ACSR 121 at [55] (Re Octaviar), in a passage to which I referred in WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd at [21]. In particular, his Honour observed that it will often be the case where not enough is known about what is likely to come from either a liquidation or a deed of company administration regime for a comparison as to relative worth not to be able to be made at an early stage. In Re Octaviar, his Honour referred to a passage from a judgment delivered by Campbell J in Deputy Commission of Taxation v Bradley Keeling Management Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 47 ; (2003) 44 ACSR 377 at 380. The passage concerned is in these terms: 
 
 Ultimately what the court needs to do is to be persuaded. The amount of proof which can result in persuasion, differs with the circumstances in which litigation comes before the court. It is common enough, in applications under s 440A , for an administrator to need to seek an adjournment very soon after his or her appointment, at a time when he or she knows very little about the affairs of the company. In that sort of situation, comparatively little material might be needed to justify a short adjournment. As time goes on, however, and the occasion that there has been for the collecting of evidence increases, so the amount of material which might need to be put before the court before it is persuaded, will increase.</text>
