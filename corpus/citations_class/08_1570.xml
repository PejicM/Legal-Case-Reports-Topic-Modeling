112 The taxpayer in Emu Bay Railway Company 71 CLR had issued a debenture, the interest on which was only payable out of its 'net income' (akin to profit). It sought to deduct interest payments on this debenture under s 51(l), even though none were made because the company had no net income. All that was decided in that case was that no interest expense was 'incurred' because the interest was contingent on net income, of which there was none.</text>

<text>70 DAPFI referred to the authoritative exposition of the relevant principles in the judgment of McHugh J in Applicant A 190 CLR applied to the interpretation of double tax treaties in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597. In McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 , a Full Court of Hill, Sundberg and Stone JJ (at [38]) summarised those principles in four sub-paragraphs:
 
 
 '. Regard should be had to the "four corners of the actual text". The text must be given primacy in the interpretation process. The ordinary meaning of the words used are presumed to be "the authentic representation of the parties' intentions": Applicant A [at 143] . 
 
 
 
 . The courts must, however, in addition to having regard to the text, have regard as well to the context, object and purpose of the treaty provisions. The approach to interpretation involves a holistic approach. 
 
 . International agreements should be interpreted "liberally". 
 
 . Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with "taut logical precision".'</text>

<text>111 Neither Emu Bay Railway Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 28 ; (1944) 71 CLR 596 nor Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Firth [2002] FCAFC 95 ; (2002) 120 FCR 450 is a useful analogy with this case.

113 Firth 120 FCR also concerned the deductibility of interest, in that case on a so-called 'capital protected' loan. The case does not bear on the interpretation of 'determined with reference to profits' in the Treaty.

114 The Commissioner submitted that the expression 'determined with reference to profits' is well able to accommodate a situation, such as this, where the calculation of the amount paid depends entirely upon the profits (here, the Adjusted Net Income) of the issuer.

115 In the Commissioner's submissions at para [104] above, it is contended that:
 
(a) The whole of each partnership distribution was required by the terms of the partnership deed to be determined with reference to profits; and
 
(b) there is no mechanism in the Treaty (or elsewhere) which permits apportionment.</text>

<text>12 Luca LP received interest income on its investments. Luca LP was treated as a company for Australian tax purposes (Div 5A of Pt III of the - ('the 1936 Act')) and paid tax at the rate of 30%. It distributed its after tax income to Industrie LP and DAPFI as general and limited partners respectively.

13 Under the terms of the Industrie Limited Partnership Deed dated 24 August 2005, as amended by amending deed dated 7 September 2005, the entitlement of DAPFI to annual receipts of income was to so much of the 'Adjusted Net Income' of each year as equalled the 'RLPI(US) Distribution Amount' for the year, subject to a proviso that if the Adjusted Net Income differed from the total of the RLPI(US) Distribution Amount and the GPI Distribution Amount payable to the general partners, the excess or shortfall should be shared pro-rata.

14 The 'RLPI(US) Distribution Amount' was calculated by multiplying DAPFI's capital contribution by the 'Agreed Rate,' which was Reuters BBSW less a stipulated spread.

84 Turning to object and purpose, Art 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Vienna Convention), referred to in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 265 per Brennan J (as he then was) as the 'leading and general rule of the interpretation of treaties', provides:
 '1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.'

85 In Applicant A 190 CLR at 253, McHugh J, after referring to what was said by Brennan J in Koowarta 153 CLR, said:
 'Commentators differ as to the correct interpretation of Art 31. Differences of opinion exist as to the circumstances in which the "context ... object and purpose" of the treaty may be used to supplement the "ordinary meaning" of the treaty. Inherent in this debate is the question of whether the textual interpretation of the words, embodied in the phrase "ordinary meaning", should be afforded interpretative precedence. Some commentators have argued that the literal meaning has no precedence and that the object of the treaty must always be taken into account [O'Connell, International Law, 2nd ed (1970), vol 1, p 253]; some have argued that the two general levels of inquiry embodied in par 1 of Art 31 have a single combined operation [Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed (1990), p 628; Ris, "Treaty Interpretation and ICJ Recourse to Travaux Pr&eacute;paratoires: Towards a Proposed Amendment of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:, Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review, vol 14(1) (1991) 111]; and some have argued that words and phrases of a treaty are in the first instance to be construed according to their plain and natural meaning and that it is only when the result of such an inquiry is doubtful that one should look to a treaty's context, object and purpose [Shearer, Starke's International Law, 11th ed (1994), pp 435-436]. Australian decisions provide no clear answer as to whether Art 31 requires or merely allows recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty in interpreting one of its terms. It is clear that such recourse is, in some circumstances, permissible. On numerous occasions, Australian courts have sought to discern the purpose of a treaty so as to construe a treaty term [Koowarta [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 265-266; Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 21 FCR 122 at 160; Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 413; SS Pharmaceutical v Qantas [1991] 1 Lloyd's Rep 288 at 295-299]. What is not clear from the decided cases, however, are the circumstances which require or allow recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty. Nor have those cases clarified the nature of the relationship between the context, object and purpose of a treaty and the 'ordinary' textual analysis of one of its provisions.'</text>

<text>70 DAPFI referred to the authoritative exposition of the relevant principles in the judgment of McHugh J in Applicant A 190 CLR applied to the interpretation of double tax treaties in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597. In McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 , a Full Court of Hill, Sundberg and Stone JJ (at [38]) summarised those principles in four sub-paragraphs:
 
 
 '. Regard should be had to the "four corners of the actual text". The text must be given primacy in the interpretation process. The ordinary meaning of the words used are presumed to be "the authentic representation of the parties' intentions": Applicant A [at 143] . 
 
 
 
 . The courts must, however, in addition to having regard to the text, have regard as well to the context, object and purpose of the treaty provisions. The approach to interpretation involves a holistic approach. 
 
 . International agreements should be interpreted "liberally". 
 
 . Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with "taut logical precision".'

71 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner's submissions depart from an application of these principles in two material respects:
 
(a) They seek to confine reference to the 'context, object and purpose' to that of the Treaty as a whole, and to avoid reference to those considerations in interpretation 'of the treaty provisions'. Considerations of context and purpose are equally relevant to the interpretation of the various articles of a treaty, the course followed in McDermott at [40] and following; and
 
(b) they are a fine example of the application of 'taut logical precision' to construction of the Treaty, not merely giving its words 'primacy' but largely excluding context and purpose.

72 A consideration of the interrelationship of the provisions of the Treaty (and other treaties following the same basic model) shows a concern with the substantive nature of the amounts over which the treaties allocate taxing rights (see for example the preference for economic substance over legal form in the conceptions of 'permanent establishment', 'business profits' and 'real estate'). Business profits, which are allocated to the taxing power of the country to which they are most closely economically connected, do not include amounts which are in substance investment income, whether rent, interest, dividends or royalties (Art 7(6)), and investment income is categorised according to the substantive (rather than the formal) rules of the domestic law. Articles 10(4), (6) and (7), 11(5), (9) and (10) and 12(4) and (5) illustrate this concern.

73 It would be an odd outcome that Art 11(9)(a), a provision whose origin manifestly lies in a purpose of confining Art 11 to what in substance regardless of its form is interest on a loan, should be so construed as to exclude from the Article an amount which in substance though not in form is interest. Such a result would seem to be contrary to the 'context object and purpose' of the provision.

75 When regard is had (as properly it should, McDermott at [41]) to the history of the provisions, it is apparent that Art 11(9)(a) served the purpose of protecting US objectives, but no material purpose in the protection of Australian taxes. Amounts 'in the nature of interest' which were (or were deemed to be) distributions on shares were for treaty purposes allocated to Art 10, as 'income from shares' (Art 10(6)), which might be subjected to withholding tax at 15%, and were excluded from Art 1l by the concluding words of Art 11(5); but Australia in any event limited its withholding tax on such amounts to 10%, treating them as the yield on debt interests. Article 11(9)(a) thus had no relevant role to play in an Australian context, and while it was as the Commissioner says 'a power allocated to each Treaty country', its construction is more illuminated by the purpose which as a matter of agreement, inserted 'as the necessary price paid for international political comity' ( Applicant A at 256) it served in US tax policy than by reference to Australian tax provisions.

76 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner also seeks support in the 'actual text' of the Treaty, but does so without regard to the whole of the text. In looking to the 'four corners of the actual text', one construes the text in the light of its purpose; as McHugh J said in Applicant A at 253, 'the ordinary meaning of the words are not to be determined in a vacuum removed from the context of the treaty or its object or purpose'. If the words are consistent with that purpose, the construction should serve to fulfill it, not to frustrate it.

77 So when reading Art 11(5), while it is accurate as a matter of taut logical precision to say (see the Commissioner's submissions at [47] above) that it applies to 'any payment which is treated as interest under domestic law, regardless of legal form':
 
(a) To do so would not be consistent with the purpose of the provision, and
 
(b) it would be inaccurate to say that the Treaty recognises no difference between what is in legal form interest and what is in substance interest: the words 'as well as', which for the purpose of the Treaty add to interest on 'securities bonds and debentures' what is 'subjected to the same taxation treatment' as interest, clearly acknowledge two categories of payments formal and substantive 'interest' as being within the operation of the Article.
 
In this context, the role of Art 11(9)(a) is to exclude what substantively is not interest from its scope: that is, what in form is interest but in substance is profit share. The text of Article 11(9)(a) bears this out: it deals with payments 'determined with reference to profits', a qualifier appropriate to what in form is framed as interest rather than profit share.</text>

<text>117 As to the Commissioner's second contention, the absence of express provision for apportionment in Art 11(9)(a) is not an exclusion or prohibition of an apportionment. A global sum payable under a contract may be apportioned where the commercial reality is that only part of the payment can be regarded as being determined with reference to profits; the apportionment should be done on the basis of a realistic estimate on sensible commercial grounds (cf., Roadshow Distributors Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [1998] 1 VR 523 at 529). This approach is all the more appropriate in the case of a treaty, which should not be construed in a narrow technical way.

118 Here the commercial reality is that the whole payment was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA, and so was interest calculated without regard to any substantive 'profit' calculation. But insofar as there is a calculation with reference to profits, only part of the payment is so calculated, because what is payable includes a basic interest amount identified in the formula, and the apportionment can be readily done in view of the way the distributions were calculated.

119 For my part, I cannot accept the proposition that the 'commercial reality' (whatever that means, but presumably a synonym for 'economic substance') is that the whole payment (the distribution from Industrie LP to DAPFI) was an indirect receipt of the interest paid by CBA. For a start, Industrie LP was not a mere interposed conduit between CBA and DAPFI. Indeed, Industrie LP did not lend to CBA; it invested the whole of its funds in another NSW limited partnership, Luca LP: see [11] above. And even Luca LP did not lend the whole of its funds to CBA; $2 million was lent at interest to other financial institutions.</text>
