<tocase>Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1983/39.html</AustLII>
<text>5 Mr Oke submits that the execution of the Birchgrove warrant was illegal and that the AFP should be ordered to return, or destroy, the hard drive image. His application raises various issues regarding the provisions of Part IAA of the Act, and the interaction of those provisions with the common law of legal professional privilege, including the principle enunciated by the High Court in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52, that a document recording a privileged communication cannot be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 (now s 3E) of the Act.

6 The validity of the Birchgrove warrant itself is not challenged. What is challenged is the validity of its execution. There are three issues to be determined on the application concerning the validity of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant:
 
 1. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because it did not comply with s 3H of the Act, in that the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not contain the name of the issuing officer and the handwritten portion of the attestation clause;
 2. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not have attached a copy of the privilege notice;
 3. Whether the seizure of the laptop computer was invalid because the executing officer did not have the requisite state of mind specified in s 3F of the Act or because it was the subject of a claim of legal professional privilege; 

Submissions were also directed to the appropriate forms of relief if any of those claims were made out.

7 A further issue arose on the amended application, but no longer arises. It concerned the purported return of the laptop computer, and then its re-seizure from Mr Oke, on 2 July 2004, apparently invoking s 3K of the Act. Senior counsel for the AFP during the hearing of the application acknowledged that the AFP's entitlement to retain the laptop computer or a copy of its hard drive was not enhanced by what occurred on 2 July 2004 or by s 3K of the Act. It is not therefore necessary to further address that issue.

101 In Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52 , the High Court by majority concluded that, in the event that legal professional privilege attaches to and is maintained in respect of documents held by a legal firm, those documents cannot properly be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 of the Act. Section 10 of the Act has since been repealed but it is similar, for present purposes, to the relevant parts of ss 3E and 3F. In Baker v Campbell it was assumed that the documents in issue were privileged, as the matter was heard on a case stated.

102 The practical difficulties which may arise in circumstances where legal professional privilege is claimed in respect of documents which would otherwise fall within the terms of a search warrant were recognised by Wilson J, who said (at 97):
 
 "It is asserted that a claim of privilege in circumstances where the proceedings in respect of which it is made have not begun immediately raises procedural difficulties if the claim is contested. There is no judge already seized of jurisdiction in the matter to determine the disputed claim. The interests of all parties must be protected pending a determination of the dispute. In my experience the procedural difficulties can be overcome consistently with that objective if the members respectively of the police force and the legal profession co-operate in a reasonable and responsible way. I do not think that it is necessary for the purposes of the stated case to explore the problem."

103 Following the decision in Baker v Campbell, the Law Council of Australia and the AFP entered into an agreement as to the manner in which such claims should be treated. The terms of that agreement form the guidelines contained in the privilege notice and which were attached to the original Birchgrove warrant.

104 The privilege notice reads as follows:
 
 "If a claim is made for legal professional privilege in respect of any document covered by the warrant, and if the person claiming privilege is prepared to co-operate with the executing officer, the following procedure will be followed to the extent to which it is possible to do so:
 
 
 
 1. The executing officer or a constable assisting will prepare a list of the relevant documents in cooperation with the person claiming privilege. The list will show the general nature of each document, the ground on which privilege is claimed, and the name of the person claiming privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. The documents will be placed in an envelope or other container which will be sealed; 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The list and the container will be endorsed with a note to the effect that, having regard to the claim for privilege, the warrant has not been executed in respect of the documents set out in the list and that those documents have been sealed in the container pending resolution of the claim; 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. The list and the container will be signed by the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. The sealed container and a copy of the list will be delivered to a third party agreed between the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 6. The third party shall hold the container and the copy of the list pending resolution of the claim for privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 7. Subject to any agreement to the contrary, the person claiming privilege will have four working days after delivery to the third party in which to commence proceedings to establish the privilege claimed. If proceedings are commenced within that time the sealed container and the copy of the list will be delivered to the registrar of the court in which the proceedings have been brought. The documents will then be held by the registrar pending the order of the court; 
 
 
 
 
 
 8. Subject to paragraph 9, if proceedings are not commenced within four working days, or such other period as may be agreed, the third party will deliver the documents, or such of them as the executing officer still wishes to examine, to the executing officer; 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. Nothing in this document prevents the executing officer from discussing a claim for privilege with the person raising the claim. If agreement can be reached on which documents are covered by legal professional privilege, and which are not, the third party will be asked to act in accordance with that agreement. 
 
 
 
 If the person claiming legal professional privilege is not prepared to cooperate with the executing officer, it will normally be necessary for the executing officer or a constable assisting to examine each relevant document to determine whether there is a proper basis for seizure."

105 Mr Oke contended that, as a matter of law, it is not possible to "seize" an item under the Act which is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege.

106 The respondent submitted that the effect of the decision in Baker v Campbell is only that a search warrant cannot be executed in a manner which abrogates or nullifies the claim of privilege. It was said that to "seize" a document or thing means to take it into lawful possession subject to the claim of privilege being determined, so that seizure under the Act was still possible even if the seized item may ultimately be recognised as privileged.

107 I do not accept either contention. In my view, Baker v Campbell decides that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of privileged documents. The Birchgrove warrant must therefore be read as authorising seizure of the documents that satisfy the conditions specified, provided that they are not documents subject to legal professional privilege. Nor does it decide that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of documents in respect of which there is merely a claim to legal professional privilege. That question did not arise. Nor, upon my reading of the judgments in Baker v Campbell , is there anything said in that case to support such a contention.

112 I consider their Honours' conclusion is consistent with the decision in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52. In Baker v Campbell the documents the subject of the search warrant were assumed to be privileged from disclosure or production on the ground of legal professional privilege. In that event, they could not be the subject of a search warrant under the Act. So, here, if the laptop computer and all its contents were to be so protected, it could not have been the subject of the Birchgrove warrant and its seizure would not have been authorised. The approach of the Full Court in JMA Accounting addresses the circumstances where there is a contested claim to such privilege and the practicality that it cannot be immediately resolved (and where s 3K(2) has not been availed of).</text>

<tocase>Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437</tocase>
<text>43 Spender J considered the validity of a series of s 3E search warrants which failed to name the issuing officer in Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437. In that case, the attack was upon the validity of the warrants, rather than upon the validity of their execution. His Honour concluded at 453-454, [60]-[63] that the omission of the issuing officer's name did not invalidate the warrants. He noted at 453, [60] that each page of the search warrants under consideration bore the registration number and signature of the issuing officer, and the official stamp of the issuing authority. In those circumstances, Spender J was satisfied that the issuing officer had "adequately identified her capacity to issue the warrants": at 454, [63]. Although I was referred to that case by counsel, on reflection I do not think it assists in resolving the present issue. The Birchgrove warrant itself is not under attack, and it contains the name of the issuing officer as well as a completed attestation clause.

44 Part IAA of the Act was introduced by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). It clearly prescribes specific powers and safeguards in relation to warrants and other matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences, including safeguards of the rights of individuals in relation to whom the coercive investigatory powers of the Commonwealth are invoked. Of particular significance to the present issue is that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) stated, in relation to s 3H(5):
 
 "In order to prevent forgery or other wrongful use of the warrant copy, subsection 3H(5) provides that the copy need not include the signature of the issuing officer or the seal of the Court. This provision has been included at the specific request of the ACT Chief Magistrate."

45 There is no prescribed form for a search warrant issued under s 3E. Subsections 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify information which an issuing officer must state in a search warrant issued under that section. That information includes the time at which the search warrant expires: s 3E(5)(e). Section 3E(5A) directs that the time so specified must be not later than the end of the seventh day after the day on which the search warrant is issued. Those subsections do not expressly require the issuing officer to be described in, or to sign, the search warrant.

46 However, in my view, it is implicit that a search warrant will also bear on its face sufficient information to identify that it has in fact been issued by an issuing officer, so that any person entitled to see a copy of the search warrant under s 3H(1) can be satisfied as to its authenticity. That was the point made by Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR at 254, [63]. Section 3H(5) also supports the inference that a search warrant issued under s 3E should bear the signature of the issuing officer or some means of identifying that the issuing officer is in fact a person falling within the definition of "issuing officer" in s 3C(1) of the Act. That is because it expressly permits the copy of a search warrant made available under s 3H(1) not to include the signature of the issuing officer. The use of the seal of a court as part of that identification would not necessarily be expected, as the issue of a search warrant under the Act is an administrative or executive act rather than a judicial one.

47 On the Birchgrove warrant, the attestation clause was immediately preceded by words addressing the requirement of s 3E(5)(e) in the following terms:
 
 "THIS WARRANT MAY BE EXECUTED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 6.00 AM AND 8.00 PM.
 
 THE TIME AT WHICH THIS WARRANT EXPIRES IS MIDNIGHT AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER THE DAY ON WHICH THE WARRANT IS ISSUED"
 

In its unexecuted form, it then continued:
 
 "GIVEN under my hand at .........
 in the State of ..................... this
 ......... day of .....................
 
 
 
 ..........................................
 A Magistrate in and for the
 State of ........................"

48 The way in which the original Birchgrove warrant was completed by the issuing officer is described in [19] above.

74 The purpose of s 3H(1) has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nor was its purpose explored in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law: Fourth Interim Report , Canberra, November 1990 (the Gibbs Committee Report) which presaged the introduction of Part 1AA into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). (The history of Part 1AA is discussed by the Full Court in Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 147-148.) In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J at [30] referred to the ability of an occupier to whom a copy of a search warrant is made available being able "to ascertain the scope of the authority conferred by [the warrant] or the jurisdiction by which it was issued". That approach also is consistent with the approach of Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR 47.</text>

<tocase>Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51</tocase>
<text>60 It is unclear whether the failure to attach the privilege notice constituted a breach of the Act. There is no requirement under the Act that a s 3E warrant contain a notice regarding an occupier's right to claim privilege over documents the subject of the warrant. In Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51, French J held that a search warrant issued pursuant to the Act was not invalid for failing to expressly limit its scope to documents the subject of legal professional privilege. The applicant nevertheless maintains that if the AFP chooses to include the privilege notice in the original warrant it must, pursuant to s 3H(1), be included in the occupier's copy.</text>

<tocase>Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/49.html</AustLII>
<text>61 I am not persuaded, in the circumstances, that the privilege notice was not "made available" to Mr Oke as part of the copy of the warrant. Section 5H(1) does not prescribe how or when the copy of a search warrant is to be made available. Whether it has been made available is a question of fact. Ideally, the copy should be made available at one time, and as early as possible. But having regard to the purpose of s 5H(1), if there were some delay in the commencement or progress of the search authorised by a search warrant, the copy might be made available at a later point in time if the purpose were not thereby frustrated. And, one can readily imagine, a page or pages of a copy might accidentally become removed from the copy prepared for presentation. In such a case, assuming the page or pages were otherwise significant (in the way identified above), the delay in providing them might not mean that they were not provided as part of the copy made available. If, upon inspecting the copy made available, the occupier noticed and drew attention to the fact that pages were missing, and they were then provided, I think s 5H(1) would have been satisfied. There are obviously many other possible circumstances. Having regard to the observations of Kirby J in Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69 ( Ousley ) at 144, whether there has been compliance is a matter of fact and degree. On the evidence in this matter, I find that the privilege notice was provided to Mr Rydon at a sufficiently early point in the process of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant that its earlier absence had not affected adversely any claim for legal professional privilege Mr Oke made or the way in which his claim for legal professional privilege was treated. I therefore find that the provision of the privilege notice in the circumstances completed (in that respect) the making available of the Birchgrove warrant.

72 Moreover, subs 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify what the legislature considers must appear in a warrant. Those provisions appear to exhaustively state the matters the warrant must disclose to make it valid (see e.g. Ousley 192 CLR at 111). In general terms, they also define the extent of the authority conferred (see e.g. per Gaudron J in Ousley 192 CLR at 94), although s 3F then enlarges upon the extent of that authority.

73 Section 3E does not expressly require the name of the issuing officer to be included in the warrant. However, s 3H(5) indicates that the issuing officer will have signed the search warrant and by implication that the name of the issuing officer will appear on it.

80 In reaching that view, I am mindful that if the Birchgrove premises were unattended, the execution of the Birchgrove warrant may have proceeded lawfully even though the copy intended to be provided was incomplete. I do not think that consideration affects my conclusion. Kirby J in Ousley 192 CLR at 144 observed that "Courts properly tend to take a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those subject to them". The fact that, in different circumstances, the Birchgrove warrant might have been lawfully executed, or indeed the fact that the Birchgrove warrant itself was available to be provided to Mr Oke (but was not made available to him), does not diminish the significance of the non-compliance with s 5H(1) in the particular circumstances.

81 I am mindful that Federal Agent Capaldo had in her possession the Birchgrove warrant and could have made it available to Mr Oke. She did not however do so, but only provided a copy of the Birchgrove warrant in the form referred to above.

82 The omission of the privilege notice (assuming contrary to my view that, in this respect also, s 5H(1) was not complied with), does not have the same consequence. Its absence does not affect the capacity of Mr Oke to be satisfied of the nature of the authority being exercised or its extent. The copy of the Birchgrove warrant initially made available included the note quoted in [20] above. The fact that Mr Oke may have claimed legal professional privilege was therefore identified.</text>

<tocase>Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>62 It was submitted alternatively on behalf of Mr Oke that the later provision of the privilege notice meant that the Birchgrove warrant was not executed reasonably, and so was invalid, relying on Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576. The same findings lead me to conclude that there was not such unreasonableness in the execution of the Birchgrove warrant as to lead to its invalidity.

63 The failure to provide a complete copy of the original Birchgrove warrant (subject to s 3H(5)) amounted to a breach s 3H(1). There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the AFP can selectively determine which parts of a search warrant it will make available to the occupier, and which parts it will not. However, it does not necessarily follow that the effect of that breach is to invalidate the entire search.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>64 The majority of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) said at 388-9, [91]:
 
 "An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition."</text>

<text>65 The construction of the Act, and particularly of s 3H, was considered (in a different context) by the Full Court of this Court in Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384. Relevantly, the Court said:
 
 "[64] The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose...
 
 [65] The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Rogers v Moore (1992) 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J. Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined. Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will, in accordance with authority, be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject...
 
 [68]...[E]ffect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred ..."</text>

<tocase>Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37</tocase>
<text>66 In their analysis of the competing policy considerations underpinning the Act, their Honours relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Lord Cooper in Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37 (at 39-40):
 
 "From the standpoint of principle it seems to me that the law must strive to reconcile two highly important interests which are liable to come into conflict (a) the interest of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasions of his liberties by the authorities, and (b) the interests of the State to secure that evidence bearing upon the commission of crime and necessary to enable justice to be done shall not be withheld from Courts of law on any merely formal or technical ground. Neither of these objects can be insisted upon to the uttermost. The protection of the citizen is primarily protection for the innocent citizen against unwarranted, wrongful and perhaps high-handed interference, and the common sanction is an action of damages. The protection is not intended as a protection for the guilty citizen against the efforts of the public prosecutor to vindicate the law. On the other hand the interest of the State cannot be magnified to the point of causing all the safeguards for the protection of the citizen to vanish, and of offering a positive inducement to the authorities to proceed by irregular methods."

67 The invasion of premises without the consent of the occupier is authorised by a warrant issued under s 3E of the Act. The validity of such a warrant necessarily depends upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. The legislative imposition of those conditions reflects the balance struck between the desirability of an effective and efficient investigation of suspected criminal offences and the need to protect the right of an individual to enjoy that person's privacy and property.</text>

<tocase>George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/26.html</AustLII>
<text>68 The High Court in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 said at 111:
 
 "... the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation." (my emphasis) 

It must be recognised that that case concerned the validity of the issue of a search warrant, and not the validity of the execution of a validly issued search warrant, although the underlying principles referred to by the High Court would appear to me to apply equally in the case of the execution of a warrant.

69 The consequence of the failure to comply with such statutory conditions may lead to the invalidity of the search warrant itself. George v Rockett is an example. Counsel for Mr Oke also relied upon certain observations in Woodroffe v National Crime Authority [1999] FCA 591 at [14] - [15] , but I do not consider that case advances Mr Oke's position simply because it concerned an application by the National Crime Authority to summarily dismiss a challenge to the validity of a search warrant and to the manner of its execution. Consequently, the Court was called upon only to determine whether the grounds of the challenge were arguable. The copy of the search warrant made available to the person challenging the validity of the execution of the search warrant was assumed not to have included the privilege notice.</text>

<text>74 The purpose of s 3H(1) has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nor was its purpose explored in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law: Fourth Interim Report , Canberra, November 1990 (the Gibbs Committee Report) which presaged the introduction of Part 1AA into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). (The history of Part 1AA is discussed by the Full Court in Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 147-148.) In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J at [30] referred to the ability of an occupier to whom a copy of a search warrant is made available being able "to ascertain the scope of the authority conferred by [the warrant] or the jurisdiction by which it was issued". That approach also is consistent with the approach of Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR 47.

77 In Wright [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J concluded that providing a copy of a search warrant (secured by urgent telephone application) which did not contain the name of the issuer or the date and time of issue did not invalidate the warrant, because in the circumstances the absence of that information could not have affected the ability of its recipient to ascertain the scope of the authority it conferred or the jurisdiction by which it was issued (at [30]). It appears at [22] however that, in the circumstances, such information was required in a "prescribed authority form" prepared by the applicant for the warrant and that the search warrant itself contained all the information prescribed by s 73 of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 (Qld). In other respects, the copy of the search warrant provided apparently had some indication as to its authenticity: see at [17].

78 There is a further significance in the omission of the information about the execution of the Birchgrove warrant from the copy. Because the Birchgrove warrant expressed the time by which that warrant expired (so as to satisfy s 3E(5)(e) and s 3E(5A)) by reference to the date of issue, the copy made available to Mr Oke did not enable him to know that the Birchgrove warrant had not expired. The requirement that the issuing officer of a search warrant state in the warrant the time at which it expires reflects the seriousness of the intrusion which the search warrant permits. The issuing officer must be satisfied under s 3E(1) that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, evidential material at the premises. The need to express an expiry time results from that legislative condition upon the issue of the warrant. Moreover, the warrant during its life, also authorises in circumstances the seizure of evidential material relating to other offences than those the subject of the issuing officer's satisfaction, and also authorises in certain circumstances the physical search of a person at or near the premises: s 3F(1)(d)(ii) and s 3F(1)(f).

79 In my view, because the omissions from the copy of the Birchgrove warrant made available to Mr Oke did not give him as the occupier any capacity to be satisfied that the Birchgrove warrant had in fact been issued, or that it was current, the purpose of s 3H(1) has not been met. The omissions from the copy of any detail of the issuing officer or the status of the issuing officer or of the date and place of its issue, therefore, in the particular circumstances, lead me to the conclusion that the execution of the Birchgrove warrant did not proceed lawfully. The consequence is that the "seizure" of the laptop computer was not lawful and it should be returned to Mr Oke. That is so although Federal Agent Capaldo told Mr Oke the date the Birchgrove warrant was issued. Section 5H does not reduce the consequences of non-compliance by allowing the oral supplementation of the document. I do not accept that orally telling Mr Oke the date of issue of the Birchgrove warrant means that the breach of s 3H(1) in the very respects which it is intended to secure means its breach should have no consequences. Moreover, the "operational realities" in which search warrants are executed do not suggest any reason why the copy of a search warrant made available under s 3H(1) should not fulfil the purpose of that provision.</text>

<text>108 The "blanket" claim to legal professional privilege was made for the reasons discussed above. But whether the laptop computer contains only legal privileged documents, or any legal privileged documents, is not yet resolved. If it contains only legally privileged documents (a position I did not understand senior counsel for Mr Oke to contend on his behalf), then it has not been validly seized under the Birchgrove warrant. If it contains some legally privileged documents, then it has been validly seized but only to the extent that it contains documents not legally privileged. I am using the term "documents" as explained in ss 25 and 25A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), and as discussed in Australian Federation of Air Pilots v Australian Airlines Ltd (1991) 28 FCR 360.</text>

<text>109 It is apparent that the privilege notice does not readily address documents stored electronically. Section 3K(2) is one means of dealing with such material, but that power was not exercised in this instance. It is also clear that the guidelines in the privilege notice are not mandatory; they are expressed as providing a procedure "to the extent to which it is possible" to follow it. The note about legal professional privilege in the Birchgrove warrant itself also stipulates that the guidelines in the privilege notice be followed as far as is reasonably practicable. Indeed, attempts to agree upon and implement an efficient and effective procedure to identify which, if any, contents of the laptop computer are in fact the subject of legal professional privilege, and so are not capable of being seized under the Birchgrove warrant, have to date been unsuccessful. See also the discussion of Spender, Madgwick and Finkelstein JJ in JMA Accounting Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 274 ; (2004) 139 FCR 537 at [6] - [12] concerning the power of search and seizure under s 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth).

110 In JMA Accounting the seizure of materials was so indiscriminate, in some instances, as to lead the Court to conclude that no reasonable effort was made to distinguish between the relevant and the irrelevant. That is not the submission presently being considered. Mr Oke's submission is that the laptop computer could not have been lawfully seized under the Birchgrove warrant because there was a blanket claim for legal professional privilege with respect to it. I have separately found that Federal Agent Capaldo did have the belief required to entitle her (subject to claims of legal professional privilege) to seize the laptop computer.

111 As to the present contention, the Full Court in JMA Accounting said at [13]-[14]:
 
 "This does not mean that an officer is prevented from conducting his s 263 search until all claims for privilege have been resolved. The resolution of such claims might take weeks or even months; it is inappropriate for the search to be delayed for that amount of time. To put the matter in its proper perspective it is necessary to recall the purpose for legal professional privilege. It is to keep secret communications between a lawyer and his client, and where the communication is written, it is to prevent the document containing the communication from being read. Accordingly, the mere seizure of a document without it being read will not infringe the privilege: Allitt v Sullivan [1988] VR 621 at 640; Solosky v The Queen (1979) 105 DLR (3d) 745 at 758.
 
 A good deal of JMA's argument on this aspect of the appeal depended upon acceptance of the proposition that legal professional privilege will be infringed if a copy of a privileged document is taken, whether or not the original or the copy is read. That proposition is simply wrong."

112 I consider their Honours' conclusion is consistent with the decision in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52. In Baker v Campbell the documents the subject of the search warrant were assumed to be privileged from disclosure or production on the ground of legal professional privilege. In that event, they could not be the subject of a search warrant under the Act. So, here, if the laptop computer and all its contents were to be so protected, it could not have been the subject of the Birchgrove warrant and its seizure would not have been authorised. The approach of the Full Court in JMA Accounting addresses the circumstances where there is a contested claim to such privilege and the practicality that it cannot be immediately resolved (and where s 3K(2) has not been availed of).

119 There has been some judicial and academic comment to the effect that the guidelines, contrary to their objective, do not preserve legal professional privilege: see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 537 (Gaudron J); Suzanne McNicol, "Unresolved Issues Arising From the General Guidelines Between the AFP and the Law Council of Australia" (1998) 72 Australian Law Journal 137. I note, however, that the law with respect to waiver of legal professional privilege has since been further refined by the High Court. It is now accepted that "it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege": Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [28] . Mr Oke's conduct in objecting to the seizure of documents at his house was wholly consistent with the maintenance of their confidentiality. It seems unlikely that any waiver of privilege should be imputed in such circumstances. Furthermore, French J held in Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 that legal professional privilege is not necessarily waived even where the occupier fails to claim privilege at the time of execution of the warrant. His Honour said, at 473:
 
 "As in the present case circumstances can arise in which the question whether legal professional privilege exists is not able to be answered by simple inspection of the documents or within a timeframe consistent with the exigencies of the investigative process."
