<text>Having considered Mr Slaveski's application that I disqualify myself, I refuse it. The High Court in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 identified the relevant considerations for an application of this kind. I have had regard, in particular, to whether there is any realistic possibility that the outcome of this litigation could affect the value of my shareholding in the CBA. I am satisfied that there is no possibility that the outcome of this litigation could have any affect on the value of my shareholding with the CBA.

In the circumstances, it could not be said that a fair-minded lay observer may reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the application before me. Accordingly, I reject the application and will consider when the matter should be listed for hearing. 
 I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bromberg.
