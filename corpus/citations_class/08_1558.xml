<tocase>Gudjala People # 2 v Native Title Registrar [2008] FCAFC 157</tocase>

<text>4 In these circumstances the Court of its own motion listed the matter for a directions hearing on 9 April 2008. At that directions hearing the Court directed the parties to file and serve submissions in relation to the disposition of the application pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act on or before 7 May 2008. Subsequent to this date and in light of the Full Court's decision in the matter of Gudjala People # 2 v Native Title Registrar [2008] FCAFC 157 delivered on 27 August 2008, parties were invited by the Court to file and serve any further submissions prior to the hearing of the application.

5 In deciding whether the application should be dismissed I have considered s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act , which provides as follows:
 The Court may, either on the application of a party or on its own motion, dismiss the application in which the claim was made ... if: 
 
 (a) the Court is satisfied that the application in issue has not been amended since consideration by the Registrar, and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar; and 
 (b) in the opinion of the Court, there is no other reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed.

6 There is no evidence, and it was not submitted by any party, that this application is likely to be amended at all, never mind in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal.</text>
