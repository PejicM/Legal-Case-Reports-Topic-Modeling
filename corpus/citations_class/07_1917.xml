<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/7.html</AustLII>
<text>3 In submissions yesterday, counsel for the respondent referred to Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 ( "Mason" ) and Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ( "Kelly" ). In Kelly at [14] Tracey J adopted "as potentially relevant and applicable" to the question of penalty the "non-exhaustive range of considerations" referred to by Mowbray FM in Mason . Plainly enough, the particular circumstances of the contravention are relevant. These circumstances are set out in my earlier reasons for judgment: see generally Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1692 , especially at [148]. This case involved the one breach, which occurred on the day of Mr Claveria's termination. In my previous reasons for judgment, I referred to the nature of the respondent's business. I previously found that the respondent terminated Mr Claveria's employment with it on 24 January 2007 for reasons that included retaliation for Mr Claveria's having recourse to the union in connection with perceived bullying and harassment on his manager's part. I have also referred to the factors that affected his manager, Mr Dunstan, at the time. I accept that Mr Dunstan was not at senior management level and was in the order of lower management. I have also referred to the fact that there was less than straight dealing on the respondent's part at and immediately subsequent to Mr Claveria's termination and to the statement in evidence by Mr Findlay, the respondent's human resources manager, that he knew that termination in retaliation for "going to the union" would be wrong and in breach of the Act .</text>

5 I have previously noted that the respondent acted so as to deny Mr Claveria the freedom to pursue a basic right protected by the Act . The need for deterrence must be borne in mind. In light of the circumstances referred to above, it appears that general, as opposed to specific, deterrence is the more important factor in this case: compare Kelly at [28]. In this regard, counsel for Mr Claveria referred to Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2005) 147 IR 462 (" FSU ") at [41], where Merkel J reiterated earlier observations that "for a penalty to have the desired [deterrent] effect, it must be imposed at a meaningful level". As counsel for Mr Claveria rightly conceded, FSU concerned conduct of a very different nature to that impugned in the present case: see Merkel J's characterisation of the conduct in FSU at [59] as "flagrant and deliberate". Notwithstanding this (and the judgments of Spender, Branson and Marshall JJ on appeal: (2007) 161 IR 262), Merkel J's statement as to the relationship of the level of penalty to general deterrence remains apposite.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/555.html</AustLII>
<text>4 Mitigating circumstances need to be borne in mind. In mitigation of penalty, the parties agreed that the respondent has "never before been found to have breached section 659 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) or like provisions in earlier legislation" and "has a history of cooperating with the union". The respondent submitted, and I accept, that it should be regarded as a first offender. I accept that the penalty should not be at the higher end of the range: compare Vickery v Assetta [2004] FCA 555 at [25] per Finkelstein J.

7 Section 841 of the Act provides that a penalty can be paid "to a particular ... person". The Court has held that a penalty can be paid to an applicant, such as Mr Claveria: see Vickery v Assetta at [25], Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union v DMG Industries Pty Ltd (1999) 89 IR 360 at 365-6 per Marshall J, Stewart v Nickles [1999] FCA 888 per Ryan JR; and Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216 at 223 per Gray J. The respondent does not oppose this course. I would order that the penalty be paid to Mr Claveria.</text>

<tocase>Furey v Civil Service Association of WA (Inc) [1999] FCA 1492 ; (1999) 91 FCR 407</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1492.html</AustLII>
<text>16 Counsel for Mr Claveria argued that these superannuation contributions should be included. If these contributions were included, the cap or limit in s 665(3) would be $31,993.23. Counsel argued that these contributions were remuneration "received by" Mr Claveria because they were received by his superannuation trustee on his behalf. She argued that the expression "received by" was to be understood as "received by or on behalf of the employee". There is some force in this submission. In Furey v Civil Service Association of WA (Inc) [1999] FCA 1492 ; (1999) 91 FCR 407 at 421, Carr J held that held that the expression "pay to the employee" in s 170CM(4) of the Act as it then stood should be understood to mean "pay to or on behalf of the employee". That is, the Act imposed an obligation on an employee seeking to pay compensation instead of notice, to pay either to or for the benefit or on behalf of the employee everything that the employee would have been entitled to have been paid had he or she worked out the required period of notice. This obligation extended to superannuation payments. By failing to pay superannuation for the four week period in question, the respondent breached s 170CM of the Act . In so concluding, Carr J followed the approach of Finn J in Comcare v Fyfe [1999] FCA 1368: see also the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in Deane v Paper Australia Pty Ltd (2003) 121 IR 362 at 366, holding that the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation rendered the employer's contribution a benefit to the employee and within the concept of "remuneration" for the purposes of calculating the limits imposed by the Act for applicants wishing to bring unfair dismissal proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Laz v Downer Group Ltd (2000) 108 IR 244</tocase>
<text>19 The parties also disagreed as to how the cap or limit in s 665(3) should be applied. According to counsel for the respondent, s 665(1)(c) does not contemplate that 'compensation' be first assessed by reference to that which the employee has lost or otherwise suffered by reason of the employer's contravention of s 659 , although he conceded that it conferred a discretion on the court, which might be exercised having regard to the employee's loss. The respondent submitted that s 665(3) operated as a jurisdictional constraint on the exercise of this discretion. The respondent argued that, if the court, in the exercise of its discretion, determined that the maximum amount of compensation payable under the cap (or some lesser amount) was appropriate, then any deductions (such as those referred to in [12] above) should be made from this amount. Finally, the respondent submitted that, to the extent that Laz v Downer Group Ltd (2000) 108 IR 244 (" Laz ") was contrary to this suggested interpretation, it was wrongly decided or was to be reconsidered in light of the fact that s 665(3) in its present form was enacted after Laz .

20 I reject the respondent's submissions concerning the operation of the cap. There is no warrant to accord to s 665(3) such a contrived operation. Section 665(3) operates merely to limit or cap the amount of compensation that the court may fix under s 665(1)(c) , as an amount to be paid by the employer to the employee in compensation for terminating his employment in contravention of s 659 of the Act . Accordingly, I propose to approach the calculation of compensation in the way advocated by counsel for Mr Claveria. That is to say, I have calculated the amount of Mr Claveria's lost remuneration, and deducted from this amount the amounts referred to at [12] above. Only then, once an appropriate compensatory figure is arrived at, should regard be had to the cap in s 665(3). As I have already said, approached in this way, if lost remuneration is properly dealt with in an order under s 665(1)(c) , then s 665(3) does not operate to require the fixing of any sum lower than the $27,643.00 which I would otherwise award to Mr Claveria (whether or not superannuation is included in the calculation of the s 665(3) cap).

21 Of course, as counsel for Mr Claveria noted, s 665(1)(b) , (d) or (e) might also support an order for the payment of lost remuneration: see Laz at 260 per Moore J. I accept this might be so. Section 665(1)(d) , in particular, would in terms provide a basis for such an order. I note, in passing, that s 665(3) apparently contemplates that an amount of compensation may be ordered under this paragraph. Having regard to the earlier form of the Act , it does not seem to me that the respondent has shown any convincing basis for its argument that Laz was wrongly decided or stands to be reconsidered. Of course, if an order of this kind were properly regarded as having been made under s 665(1)(d) (or paragraphs (b) or (e)), the limit set by s 665(3) would not apply. This is a matter to be considered on another day.

22 In summary, the first respondent should pay Mr Claveria the sums of $4,000 by way of penalty, $27,643.00 (with an appropriate deduction for taxation) in lost remuneration, and $2,924.31 to Mr Claveria's nominated superannuation trustee. 

 I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny J.
