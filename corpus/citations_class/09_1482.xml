<text>The background to this judgment is set out in full in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 and Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen (No 2) [2009] FCA 1383. In Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen (No 2) [2009] FCA 1383 I ordered that these proceedings be transferred to the Family Court of Australia. The only outstanding matter for decision at this stage relates to costs incurred in the following proceedings: An application by Mrs Jensen for a stay of the proceedings for abuse of process. Mrs Jensen was unsuccessful in respect of this application.</text>

<text>3. Third, I am not persuaded by the trustee's submission that costs of the notice of motion for transfer should be costs in the cause of the trustee's application in this court to be transferred to the Family Court. While the trustee had, appropriately, commenced these proceedings in this Court and had a prima facie right to have his claim heard in this Court, Mrs Jensen was well within her rights to apply for an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court. I do not agree that Mrs Jensen sought, unsuccessfully, to have the proceedings transferred to the Family Court at the hearing of 31 March 2009 in fact although counsel for Mrs Jensen invited the Court to make the order of its own initiative, no formal application for transfer was made. I do not think that, at this stage, an order should be made that such costs should be costs in the cause and awarded according to the final award of costs in the action (cf comments of Lord Denning in JT Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 3 All ER 1122 at 1123).</text>

<text>4. Finally, even were I minded to order costs in favour of the trustee in whole or in part, I am not persuaded that the demands of justice require a departure from the general rule that an order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceeding has concluded (cf Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 297 at 312, Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545). Although the trustee was successful in its notice of motion to strike out paragraphs of the Defence and in its opposition to para 24 of the Cross-Claim, the principal proceedings will now continue in the Family Court. In my view it is for the trial judge in that Court to determine where costs should fall, including in respect of the interlocutory proceedings.
 I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.
