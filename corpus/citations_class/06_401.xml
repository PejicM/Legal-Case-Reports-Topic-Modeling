<tocase>Gough v Myall Pty (2001) FCA 1692</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1692.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The applicant sought to introduce fresh evidence before me providing an alternative version of events, from the applicant's perspective, on the morning of 2 May 2005 when she was putatively served with the petition. However, the whereabouts of the applicant on that morning have already been exhaustively argued before his Honour. The applicant has already, it seems, given one version of events on that morning which has been dismissed by the learned Federal Magistrate, and is now seeking to put forward another version. In my view comments of Gray J in Gough v Myall Pty (2001) FCA 1692 at par 14 are pertinent to this case, namely,
 
 'the appeal system does not allow a party to make repeated attempts to change findings of fact by introducing evidence that could have been introduced at an earlier stage.'

40 In my view, it is prima facie unlikely, for the reasons given by his Honour, that the Court would make any finding other than that the applicant was served with the second creditor's petition at her premises at Wooloowin on the morning of 2 May 2005. His Honour was satisfied on the evidence of the process server that the applicant had been served with the second creditor's petition. On the evidence before me I would not disturb the finding of the learned Federal Magistrate on the issue of whether the applicant was actually served with the second creditor's petition.

41 The applicant has also claimed that she now has additional resources, in the form of refinancing from other creditors. It is difficult to know how to view this evidence. While it may be evidence of solvency, the fact of the matter is that, if the applicant has recently managed to obtain additional credit while she has been a bankrupt (TS p 57 ll 24-28), her actions are likely to have been in breach of s 269 of the Act and hence unlawful. I make no finding in relation to this issue.

42 In my view the case put to me by the applicant does not on its face disclose any basis upon which I would disturb the findings of the learned Federal Magistrate on appeal. His Honour heard the evidence before him, and refused to annul the bankruptcy of the applicant under s 153B(1) of the Act. The applicant has made submissions concerning comments of his Honour in refusing to exercise his discretion in the applicant's favour, including the view of his Honour that the applicant's affairs were deserving of further investigation, as she failed to disclose assets to the trustees, failed to comply with her obligations under the Act, and there was uncertainty with respect to ownership of assets. In view of the nature of the case, I am not prepared to hold that his Honour was in error in so finding. As stated succinctly by the learned authors of McDonald Henry and Meek Australian Bankruptcy Law and Practice at par 153B.0.07:
 
 'The discretionary consideration is an important factor and is often overlooked by applicants. Despite an applicant demonstrating that the sequestration order ought not to have been made or the debtor's petition ought not to have been presented the discretionary factors may result in the application being refused.'

43 On review of the case and the evidence before me, in my view an appeal from the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate would be bound to fail. I find there are no special reasons within the meaning of O 52 r 15(2) to extend time to the applicant to file her notice of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM.

44 Accordingly, I dismiss the application with costs.
 I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier J.

<tocase>Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2003) FCAFC 315</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/315.html</AustLII>
<text>32 As pointed out by the Full Court in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2003) FCAFC 315 at par 20,
 
 'The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled... Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made.'

33 On the facts of this case, the applicant has committed an act of bankruptcy. There appears to be no dispute that the applicant was indebted to the respondent, that the respondent obtained a final judgment for the sum in question, and that this final judgment formed the basis of the bankruptcy notice. That debt, and that judgment are not in any way being impugned in this matter. Failure to comply with the bankruptcy notice in turn resulted in a sequestration order being made against the applicant. I have already recounted in some detail the background to this debt.

34 The applicant has submitted before me that, notwithstanding that she did not pay the debt, she was nonetheless solvent that is, able to pay all of her debts as and when they became due and payable. The applicant has also sought to demonstrate that her income exceeded her expenditure during the period when the sequestration order was made, and indeed the applicant has claimed that she had estimated gross annual earnings net of expenses of $90 000 (TS p 23 ll 35-38). However it became clear during cross-examination before me that the applicant has little or no income, and had little or no income at the date of the sequestration order (for example, TS p 15 l 3). Further, under cross-examination by counsel for I &amp; L Securities it became apparent that the applicant's expenses far exceeded any earnings during this time (TS pp 25-32).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>30 At the same time, it is vital to constantly keep in mind that the power exercised by the learned Federal Magistrate at first instance under s 153B(1), is discretionary. As pointed out by Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in the well-known case House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505, in the case of an appeal against an exercise of discretion, the appellate court must not attempt to simply substitute its opinion for that of the court at first instance. It must appear that some error has been made by the judge at first instance in exercising discretion, before the appellate court can and should interfere in that decision.

31 The merits of the applicant's proposed appeal case were argued in detail and at length during the hearing before me. The key matters upon which the case prospectively appears to turn are:
 
 
 &#8226; Whether the applicant was actually solvent at the date of the sequestration order, and therefore whether the order should not have been made;
 &#8226; Whether the applicant was actually served with the second creditor's petition; and
 &#8226; The applicant's claim that she now has additional resources, in the form of refinancing from other creditors.</text>

<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344</tocase>
<text>6 The Full Court in Jess v Scott emphasised that, given the discretionary nature of the Court's power in O 52 r 15(2) to relax the requirement of the general rules, the power should not itself 'become entangled in a web of rules spun out of the Court's discretionary decisions'. (p 20) However, there are a number of guiding principles which may assist the court in exercising its discretion. These were described by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349, and adopted by the Full Court in Parker v The Queen at par 6, as follows:
 
 
 1. applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislated time limits are not to be ignored. The applicant must show an 'acceptable explanation for the delay'; it must be 'fair and equitable in the circumstances' to extend time;
 2. action taken by the applicant, other than by way of making an application for review, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished;
 3. any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension;
 4. however, the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension; and
 5. the merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.</text>

<tocase>Jess v Scott (unreported Full Court of the Federal Court, Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ, 4 November 1986)</tocase>
<text>5 Prima facie , time limits set by the Federal Court Rules , including those with respect to notices of appeal, are there to be observed by the parties. However, O 52 r 15(2) vests a discretion in the Court to extend the time during which a notice of appeal may be lodged, in order to avoid injustice where a party has missed a prescribed deadline for lodgement ( Parker v The Queen [2002] FCAFC 133 at par 13). 'Special reasons' must be demonstrated in order for this rule to be invoked. In considering the meaning of this term in Jess v Scott (unreported Full Court of the Federal Court, 4 November 1986), the Full Court said:
 
 'It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days. In that context, the expression "special reasons" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression "for special reasons" implies something narrower than this.' (pp 18-19)

6 The Full Court in Jess v Scott emphasised that, given the discretionary nature of the Court's power in O 52 r 15(2) to relax the requirement of the general rules, the power should not itself 'become entangled in a web of rules spun out of the Court's discretionary decisions'. (p 20) However, there are a number of guiding principles which may assist the court in exercising its discretion. These were described by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349, and adopted by the Full Court in Parker v The Queen at par 6, as follows:

 3. any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings that is caused by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension;

<tocase>Kalaba v R (unreported, 13 September 1996, Finn J)</tocase>
<text>28 In my view, the key question is whether, prima facie , the merit of the applicant's case is such that the Court should exercise its discretion to allow additional time to file a notice of appeal. To paraphrase Finn J in Kalaba v R (unreported, 13 September 1996 at p 6, quoting in turn the Full Court in Jones v The Queen (unreported) Federal Court, 17 August 1984), has the applicant demonstrated that her appeal may have sufficient prospect of success to make it just that she should not be allowed to proceed with it? The other side of this coin is clearly that it is potentially unjust to all parties to this matter to allow the applicant to proceed with a case, where there are not sufficient prospects of success, but which would cause all parties to perhaps futilely incur costs, and introduce improper delay into the affairs of the parties.

29 It is appropriate that I should then consider the prima facie merit of the applicant's appeal case should she be granted leave to now file her notice of appeal.</text>

<tocase>Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1966/28.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The applicant has also claimed that her apparent excess of assets over liabilities means that she was solvent at the relevant time: Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670. I note that, to some extent, it is difficult to know exactly what assets the applicant owns, as there appears to be disputes about, for example, various vehicles and boats. Further, I note, as did his Honour, that the applicant has apparently concealed property, including a china collection, for fear that it would be removed from her.

36 In my view, the applicant has not established a prima facie case that she was solvent at the date of the sequestration order upon which her bankruptcy is founded.</text>

<tocase>Stankiewicz v Plata (2002) FCA 1185</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1185.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In Stankiewicz v Plata (2002) FCA 1185 at par 19 the Court held that in determining whether a sequestration order ought not to have been made, the court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time the order was made, but as it would have been disclosed had all the true facts been before the court on the making of the order. In my view in the case before me, no new facts of substance, relevant to the making of the sequestration order, have emerged since the hearing before the learned Federal Magistrate. In my view the evidence before me shows that it is likely the applicant was not solvent at the date of the sequestration order. I note that his Honour also considered evidence in relation to solvency of the applicant during the relevant period. His Honour, in light of evidence before him, exercised his discretion and refused to annul the applicant's bankruptcy. There appeared on the case before me to be little or no variation in the financial position of the applicant over the period before and after the making of the sequestration order.

38 No evidence has been brought before me which would prima facie incline me to disturb his Honour's findings on appeal in relation to whether the sequestration order ought to have been made.</text>
