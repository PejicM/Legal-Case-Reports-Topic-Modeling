<text>The applicant also relies on s 164 of Schedule 1, which permits a member of an organisation to apply for an order giving directions for the performance or observance of any of the rules of the organisation by any person who is under an obligation to perform or observe those rules. As the applicant noted, in R v Joske; ex parte Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association [1976] HCA 48 ; (1976) 135 CLR 194 at 212-213, Mason and Murphy JJ discussed the precursor of s 164, including s 164(4). ( I refer to their Honours' observations, without setting them out.) Section 164(4) provides for the Court to make interim orders "that it considers appropriate ...". Further, under s 164B(3) of Schedule 1, the Court, in considering an application under s 164 (or s 164A) , may, by an order, make a declaration that the whole or a part of the rules of the organisation contravene s 142 or that the rules of the organisation contravene that section in a particular respect: see Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431 at 481.</text>

I am not persuaded that the applicant has made a sufficient showing that rule 62 does not make any appropriate provision for General Meetings to allow members of the Branch the opportunity to attend. In this context, it seems to me that it must be borne in mind that rule 62(c) requires that notice of the proposed Special General Meeting be given to each shop steward, presumably so that such notice can be conveyed to the members. Rule 62(e) provides that, in such a case as this, the Meeting be held within 35 days of the receipt of the petition, and at a time and place determined by the Branch Committee. As counsel for Mr Jackson noted, the power to appoint a time and place must be exercised bona fide and for the purpose for which it was conferred in furtherance of the democratic participation of the members in the Meeting: compare Allen v Townsend 31 FLR at 483-488 and Scott v Jess (1984) 3 FCR 263 at 287.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/554.html</AustLII>
<text>The parties did not dispute the nature of the test to be applied on an application for interim orders. In McGee v Sanders (No 2) [1991] FCA 554 ; (1991) 32 FCR 397 , at 402-403, Gray J discussed the test to be applied, saying: 
 In opening the application for interim orders, counsel for the applicants indicated that she would endeavour to show that there existed a serious issue to be tried as to the applicants' entitlement to relief, and that the balance of convenience favoured the applicants. I am by no means convinced that these tests, which have been applied by courts in dealing with applications for interlocutory injunctions, are appropriate to the specific statutory power under s 209(4) of the Act. It should be noted that the power to make interim orders is given in broad terms. The court may make "such interim orders as it considers appropriate". Parliament has not chosen to use the word "injunction". The practice in granting or refusing interim orders differs from the practice in relation to interlocutory injunctions in at least one important respect. It is rare for an applicant for interim orders to be called upon to give an undertaking that he or she will pay damages in the event of failure. In my view, it is the duty of the court to do justice as best it can when confronted by an application for interim orders. Sometimes, the evidence proffered by an applicant will be uncontested and will demonstrate a strong case. In such circumstances, a court will naturally be more ready to make orders on an interim basis. 

In Conquo v Jackson [2009] FCA 45 , at [16], Sundberg J approached an application for interim orders, having regard to this passage and also the test for a conventional interlocutory injunction. Broadly speaking, on the present application, counsel approached the matter by examining the "serious question" issue and the "balance of convenience", noting at the same time that it was "the duty of the court to do justice as best it can".</text>

<tocase>Moffitt v The Vehicle Builders Employees' Federation of Australia (1985) 11 IR 174</tocase>
<text>There is little dispute about what is intended by the words "oppressive, unreasonable or unjust". In Moffitt v The Vehicle Builders Employees' Federation of Australia (1985) 11 IR 174 at 175, a Full Court adopted the meaning given by Deane J to these words in Municipal Officers' Association of Australia v Lancaster [1981] FCA 151 ; (1981) 54 FLR 129 at 165, where his Honour said: 
 Those three words are used objectively in the clause and each of them is to be given its ordinary strong meaning. Plainly, their meanings overlap and definition is liable to adulterate the strength which the words possess. Nonetheless, it seems desirable that I indicate the meaning which I ascribe to them. To be oppressive, a condition, obligation or restriction must be burdensome, harsh and wrongful ... To be unreasonable, it must be immoderate and inappropriate. To be unjust, it must be contrary to right and justice and to ordinary standards of fair play ... 

In effect, the applicant argued that the rules under challenge are oppressive, unreasonable or unjust because they fail to make proper provision for the control of the Branch committee by the members as opposed to a clique of members.</text>

<tocase>Griffiths v Ansett Pilots Association [2001] FCA 1215</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1215.html</AustLII>
<text>Particularly in support of the submission that rule 62 did not make any appropriate provision for General Meetings to allow members of the Branch the opportunity to attend, counsel for the applicant relied on Griffiths v Ansett Pilots Association [2001] FCA 1215 , in which Ryan J said, at [9]: 
 It is common ground that the control provided for by the rules must be available in a practical sense and must not be susceptible to obstruction or unreasonable delay by the committee concerned. The related general observation can be made, in this context, that the reasonableness of the rules of an organisation, within the meaning of s 196 of the Act, is to be measured by what is practicably achievable under the rules in the actual circumstances in which they operate. 

(Section 196 was a precursor to s 142 of Schedule 1. )

Ryan J continued, at [10]: 
 The circumstances to which I referred in the last paragraph, or "extrinsic facts" as they have been called, include the number of members of the organisation, their geographic distribution and concentration, whether or not the organisation is divided into branches and the nature of the industry or occupational activities in which members are engaged. 

This principle derives from such authorities as Hodder v Australian Workers' Union (1985) 9 FCR 498 , at 502 per Pincus J, approved in Lawley v Transport Workers' Union of Australia (1987) 22 IR 114 and Thomson v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union of Australia (1996) 70 IR 59 ; and Gordon v Carroll (1975) 27 FLR 129 , at 173 per Smithers, Woodward and St John JJ.

As Ryan J noted in Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215 , at [14], the rules under consideration in that case contemplated that each general meeting be held at only one place prescribed by the proper body or officer. After recording counsel's submission that the rules of the Association did not infringe s 195(1)(b)(iv) as the Act then stood, his Honour said, at [25]-[26]: 
 ... "control" as used in that provision, extends to control between elections. It is possible, particularly for an organisation with relatively few members, to provide for such control by granting a reasonably small number of members the facility to require the calling of a general meeting if such a meeting has the power to give directions to the relevant committee. No such power appears to be reposed by the rules in their present form in a general meeting of the Association. Moreover, the facility to require a general meeting which is accorded by rule 34 of the Association's rules is severely circumscribed by the location of its members and the nature of their work. As well, the fact that a single general meeting may only be convened at one place and at one place and at one time, in the light of the geographic distribution of the Association's members and their variously rostered working hours and the restrictions on voting by proxy, precludes that facility from according to members the requisite degree of control. ... 

 
 It might have been otherwise had the rules permitted the calling of general meetings at several locations and staggered hours to maximise the opportunity for members to attend, and had the rules permitted the votes cast at such meetings to be aggregated for the purpose of deciding whether a binding direction had been given to the COM. However, while the rules remain in their present form, I do not consider, putting to one side new rule 56, that they provide in the requisite sense for control of the COM by the members.

The applicant argued that Ryan J's ruling in Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215 was apposite to this case. Mr Jackson did not dispute the principles outlined by his Honour, but affirmed that the present case was a different one from Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215.

In effect, the applicant's case was that, having regard to the nature of the members' employment, general meetings were not an adequate controlling mechanism and that a plebiscite should be the means by which the governing body was controlled by members but that a plebiscite could not operate in this way under the Union's rules. To make good the first part of this argument, the applicant again relied on Ryan J's analysis in Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215 , where, citing Boland v Munro (1980) 48 FLR 66 , his Honour said at [28]: 
 Control [in the relevant sense] is not confined to the control which may be said to be exercisable through the ballot box at elections but extends, in a limited sense, to control between elections. ... 

 
His Honour accepted that, "control", in the present context, meant a power to check or restrain and not dominating control: [29]. In Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215 at [40] - [41] , Ryan J concluded that:
 
 [I]n evaluating the sufficiency of control over a committee given to the members, regard has to be had to the rules as a whole. ... 

 
 ... 

 
 Because I have been persuaded ... that the rules as a whole of the Association, considered without regard to the new rule 56, fail to make a provision required by the Act, namely one for control of the COM by the members, it follows that an order may be made under s 208 of the Act unless the new rule 56 has effectively remedied the failure.

As Mr Jackson pointed out, however, in Griffiths [2001] FCA 1215 , Ryan J was concerned with a meeting of a national union, whose membership was dispersed through-out Australia and more than half of whom were likely at any one time to be preparing for flight duties. I accept, as Mr Jackson submitted, that the present case might well be relevantly distinguishable from Griffiths . On the evidence as it presently stands, it cannot be said that there is necessarily a Griffiths -type situation. Indeed, as Mr Jackson reiterated, there was some evidence before the Court that 10,600 Branch members (out of a total of 15,449) listed their home address at a location within a 70 kilometre radius of Dallas Brooks Hall in central Melbourne. Moreover, none of the evidence before the Court about attendance at Branch meetings apparently related to attendance at Special General Meetings.</text>
