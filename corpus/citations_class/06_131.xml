<text>4 Although the issues raised by the appeal are straightforward, it is helpful to summarise the factual background. It is set out in some detail in two Supreme Court judgments: see Todaytech Distribution Pty Ltd v Yu [2004] VSC 246 (" Todaytech No 1 ") and Todaytech Distribution Pty Ltd v Yu [2005] VSC 313 (" Todaytech No 2 ").</text>

<text>30 Like appeals to the Full Court from a single judge of this Court, an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of re-hearing: see Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 (" Abeyesinghe ") at [4]; and Low v Commonwealth [2001] FCA 702 at [3] ; see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 533 [75] ; and Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 at [50] - [54] .

32 In Coal and Allied Operations , at 203-204 [14], the High Court said that statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of re-hearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error. A similar observation was made by the Full Court of this Court in Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 432-433 [21] . Thus, it has been said that this Court's appellate powers are only exercisable if the appellant can demonstrate that the orders under appeal are the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error: see Abeyesinghe at [4].</text>

<tocase>Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 ; (2000) 203 CLR 194</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/47.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The expression 'appeal by way of re-hearing' is used in contradistinction to the expressions 'appeal in a strict sense', and 'appeal by way of hearing de novo '. It is important to bear in mind what these expressions connote. In the case of an appeal in the strict sense, the function of the appellate court is to determine whether the decision in question was right or wrong on the evidence and the law as it stood when the decision below was given. Where an appellate tribunal can receive further evidence and its powers are not restricted to making the decision that should have been made at first instance, the appeal is usually described as an appeal by way of re-hearing. An appeal by way of hearing de novo is one in which the matter is heard afresh, and the decision is given on the evidence presented at the appellate hearing: see Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 ; (2000) 203 CLR 194 (" Coal and Allied Operations ") at 203 [12]-[13].

32 In Coal and Allied Operations , at 203-204 [14], the High Court said that statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of re-hearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error.

<tocase>St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1337.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337 at [13] (" Helfenbaum "), Sundberg J said:
 
 "The existence of a cross-claim may be a 'sufficient cause' within s 52(2)(b) for declining to make a sequestration order: Ling v Enrobook Pty Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 19 at 25. It is for the debtor to establish the existence of 'sufficient cause': Cain v Whyte [1933] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 at 645-646; Ling at 24. He must establish that he has a real claim against the creditor that is likely to succeed. If the Court is satisfied that there is such a claim, and that its quantum is likely to equal or exceed the creditor's claim, it will not make a sequestration order. If the claim is likely to be less than the creditor's claim, the Court will require the debtor, if he is to avoid a sequestration order, to pay the difference between the judgment debt and the amount he is likely to recover on his claim. See Re Player (1962) 19 ABC 277 at 282; Re Schmidt; Ex parte Anglewood Pty Ltd (1968) 13 FLR 111 at 115-116; Ling at 25-26; Commonwealth Bank v McDonald [1999] FCA 984. A debtor does not establish a real claim that is likely to succeed merely by producing a statement of claim in an action against the creditor: Re Rivett; Ex parte Edward Fay Ltd (1932) 5 ABC 182; Player at 282, or by pointing to the existence of current litigation against the creditor: cf Re Douglas Griggs Engineering Ltd [1963] 1 Ch 19 at 23. While the Court does not try the cross-claim in advance, the debtor must adduce sufficient evidence to show that it is a real claim which is likely to succeed: cf Vogwell v Vogwell (1939) 11 ABC 83 at 88; Player at 282."

35 The appellant's counterclaim is set out in pars 50 and 51 of the defence and counterclaim. It states:
 
 "By way of Counterclaim the Defendant says: 
 
 50. The Plaintiff [the respondent in the appeal] is and was at all material times a corporation registered pursuant to the laws of the State of Victoria. 
 
 51. The Defendant refers to and repeats paragraphs 6 to 46 hereof as if they were set out hereunder seriatim."

36 The central allegations in pars 6 to 46 of the defence and counterclaim are that: 
 
 (a) by a contract of employment made on or about 20 February 1992 which was varied by subsequent agreements, the appellant agreed to work for the respondent as a full-time warehouse distributor and delivery man ("the first contract");
 (b) it was a term of the first contract that the defendant would receive such overtime, sick leave, annual leave and long service leave as he was entitled to received under statute ("the statutory entitlements");
 (c) it was a term of a subsequent agreement that the appellant would receive a commission equal to 15% of the respondent's net profits ("the commission"); and
 (d) despite the appellant's requests and in breach of the agreements, the respondent has failed and/or refused to pay to the appellant the statutory entitlements and the commission and therefore the respondent is indebted to the appellant in the sum of $593,432.22.

39 As noted by Sundberg J in Helfenbaum , it is insufficient for the appellant merely to produce the counterclaim. Sufficient evidence must be adduced to show that it is a real claim which is likely to succeed. On the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant did not refer me to any evidence which supported the counterclaim. Rather, counsel submitted that it was unnecessary to look beyond the allegations contained in the counterclaim. He submitted that Hartnett FM had fallen into error simply by failing to take account of, and give weight to, the allegations contained in the counterclaim. I reject these submissions.

40 In her reasons for judgment, Hartnett FM refers to an affidavit sworn 29 July 2005 in which the appellant disposed to his belief that his Supreme Court counterclaim was on foot and needed to be repleaded. Apart from this belief, Hartnett FM said that the appellant had provided no evidence to the Federal Magistrates Court deposing to the factual matters on which the counterclaim is based, despite having more than adequate opportunity of doing so. In these circumstances, it is impossible to say that Hartnett FM erred by making the sequestration order.

41 The 27 October affidavit was not in evidence before Hartnett FM, and no application was made to me for leave to rely upon fresh evidence in this appeal. However, even if regard is had to the material in this affidavit and the exhibits thereto, it does not establish that the counterclaim has a real prospect of success.</text>
