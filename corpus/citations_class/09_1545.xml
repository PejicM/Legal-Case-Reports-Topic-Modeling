<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/44.html</AustLII>
<text>The relevant principles to applications under ss 52 and 53(e) of the TP Act are well established: see eg Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 ( Parkdale ); Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 ( Taco Bell ).

Whether a representation is likely to mislead or deceive is an objective question of fact, to be determined in all the circumstances: Taco Bell . It is sufficient if there is a real chance that the conduct or representation will mislead or deceive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87. Importantly, whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive must be determined in context. In Parkdale it was said at 199: 
 
 It seems clear enough that consideration must be given to the class of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct. Although it is true, as has often been said, that ordinarily a class of consumers may include the inexperienced as well as the experienced, and the gullible as well as the astute, the section must in my opinion by (sic) regarded as contemplating the effect of the conduct on reasonable members of the class. The heavy burdens which the section creates cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will or (sic) course depend on all the circumstances.

In my view, it is unlikely that a reasonable group of persons seeing those communications would think about the place of origin of those artworks. There is no express representation about their place of origin. There is no real reason why, beyond the clear representation as to the Aboriginality of the artist, the reasonable consumer would advert to their place of origin. In other words, the particular conduct which is said to give rise by implication to the representation that the place of origin of the particular artworks is Australia does not, in my judgment, give rise to that representation. Indeed, as was pointed out in Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (No 1) [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 39 FCR 546 at 555, s 52 is not expressed in terms of, and is not confined to, representations. The question is one of fact, namely whether the conduct complained of is likely "to lead into error" (per Gibbs CJ in Parkdale [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 198). Relevantly here, the question is whether the conduct, tested against ordinary and reasonable members of a section of the public, may have led into error those persons as to the place of origin of those particular artworks (as distinct from the Aboriginality of the artist). Campomar would indicate that the appropriate question is what would be the likely reaction of that section of the public to the particular conduct.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>The test is an objective one for the Court upon the whole of the evidence. The test is whether an ordinary or reasonable person from the class of persons to whom the representation is made is likely to be misled or deceived: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ( Campomar ) at 85-7.

<tocase>QDSV Holdings Pty Ltd (t/as bush Friends Australia) v Trade Practices Commission [1995] FCA 1431 ; (1995) 131 ALR 493</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1995/1431.html</AustLII>
<text>In QDSV Holdings Pty Ltd (t/as bush Friends Australia) v Trade Practices Commission [1995] FCA 1431 ; (1995) 131 ALR 493 ( QDSV Holdings ), the appellant was a wholesaler of soft toys. One of its products was a koala soft toy, which had a label attached to it with the words "Aussie Born" on one side, and the words "Made in Australia" on the other side, with smaller words "With Some Imported Components" beneath those words. The soft toys were designed in Australia, the components were manufactured in China, except for about 30% of the filling, and all the components were then imported into Australia, for assembly within Australia. The primary judge declared the labels were in breach of ss 52 and 53(eb) of the TP Act and made an order under s 80 of the TP Act. The Full Court dismissed an appeal from those orders and held that the labels were misleading and deceptive, although that the toys could fairly be described as having been designed and finished in Australia. Sackville J observed at 500: 
 
 While it should not be assumed that purchasers are "extraordinarily stupid" ... neither should it be assumed that purchasers of products such as toy koalas will be scrupulous to analyse the nuances of the language the trader has chosen to use on labels attached to the merchandise ... The meaning conveyed by the labels will be assessed by construing the language employed, but will take account of such factors as the prominence given to particular slogans or phrases, the nature of the product itself and the expectations and likely understanding of consumers.</text>

<tocase>Thorp v C.A. Imports Pty Ltd (1990) ATPR 40-996</tocase>
<text>I do not consider those cases provide any real assistance in the circumstances. As Sheppard J said in Thorp v C.A. Imports Pty Ltd (1990) ATPR 40-996 at 50,966, the question is one of fact and degree depending upon a consideration of the entirety of the steps required to manufacture the object in question. Of course, in addition, it is now necessary to apply ss 65AB and 65AE.

The evidence shows that the cost to ADC of the carved wooden bird (and like objects) was under $10. The amount paid to Mr Goodridge for painting it was in excess of $30. The precise figures varied, according to the size of the objects. Even allowing for shipment costs, I find that s 65AB(c) of the TP Act would be satisfied, if there had been a representation that those artworks were Australian in origin.

The remaining issue is whether those items were substantially transformed by being painted in Australia: s 65AB(b). The alleged country of origin representations did not attract ss 65AC or 65AD, so s 65AB(d) was also satisfied. That is a question of fact, informed by s 65AE. In my judgment, those artworks including the carved wooden bird were substantially transformed by being painted in Australia. There was in evidence an example of the carved wooden bird, unpainted (it is then purely a flat white in colour). The difference is significant. As an unpainted object, it is quite unappealing. The shape itself seems to lack definition. The painting makes the object quite a different one: the shape emerges as clearly defined, and the colouring gives the object a real life and attractiveness. I think the description "new and different goods" is an appropriate one, even though fundamentally the shape itself does not change. It is, in a bland sense, and remains a carved wooden item but the qualities which make it an attractive object emerge only after it is painted. Analogy is always a little dangerous, but I essay one, albeit not a perfect one: a painter's canvas may be imported, and although it does not change size, the canvas is substantially transformed by being painted. The carved wooden bird shape is, of course, not the equivalent of a canvas. It is already shaped. However, the dramatic change in appearance, including that the painting seems to add definition to the shape, has to my mind a not dissimilar transformation.</text>
