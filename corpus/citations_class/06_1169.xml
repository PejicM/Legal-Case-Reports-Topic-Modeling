<tocase>Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1983/39.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Legal professional privilege has been recognised as a fundamental right in our legal system since the reign of Elizabeth I (see Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton Rev 1961) Vol VIII, para 2290). In Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 Wilson J referred to the current principle of legal professional privilege (at 95) as follows: 
 
 
 'The multiplicity and complexity of the demands which the modern state makes upon its citizens underlines the continued relevance of the privilege to the public interest. The adequate protection according to law of the privacy and liberty of the individual is an essential mark of a free society and unless abrogated or abridged by statute the common law privilege attaching to the relationship of solicitor and client is an important element in that protection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 It is not only a matter of protection of the client. The freedom to consult one's legal adviser in the knowledge that confidential communications will be safeguarded will often make its own contribution to the general level of respect for and observance of the law within the community see an article by Charles A Miller, "The Challenges to the Attorney Client Privilege" Virginian Law Review , vol. 49 (1963), p.262.'

18 In the same decision Deane J said (at 118): 
 
 
 '... I am persuaded that the general and substantive principle underlying legal professional privilege is of fundamental importance to the protection and preservation of the rights, dignity and equality of the ordinary citizen under the law in that it is a precondition of full and unreserved communication with his lawyer.'

23 Saunders concerned a claim for privilege in respect of documents seized by the AFP as part of an ongoing investigation into the taxation affairs of the applicant. 
It had been submitted by the AFP in that case that because the applicant failed to claim privilege at the time of the execution of the warrant, he had impliedly waived privilege over the seized documents. In that case, the AFP relied on observations of Mason J in Baker v Campbell at 80 to the effect that the authorities seemed to suggest that privilege was lost as soon as a document passed into the hands of another who may tender it in evidence. French J in Saunders said of these observations at 473: 
 
 
 'With respect, these observations of the majority in Baker v Campbell fall a long way short of the suggestion that the seizure under warrant of a document the subject of legal professional privilege which has not been waived causes that privilege to be lost. The fact that the seizure may have occurred in circumstances in which the officer executing the warrant was unaware of the subsistence of legal professional privilege in the relevant document does not, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that the privilege is lost.'</text>

<tocase>Benecke v National Australia Bank Ltd (1993) 35 NSWLR 110</tocase>
<text>21 In Mann v Carnell , the High Court referred to the case of Benecke v National Australia Bank Ltd (1993) 35 NSWLR 110, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In that case, a woman gave evidence concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings, apparently believing that she could prevent the barrister giving his version of the instructions. The Court of Appeal held that privilege had been impliedly waived. The High Court said of that decision (at 13): 
 
 
 'She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege. She may not even have turned her mind to the question. However, her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.'

22 However both Mann v Carnell and Benecke involved circumstances where the alleged waiver resulted from a voluntary act by the holder of the privilege, albeit an act which was not intended to waive privilege. The present case involves circumstances where documents were provided under compulsion of law. Several authorities have indicated that the considerations in such cases are likely to be different: see Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 473; Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364 at 368-9; Goldberg and Anor v Ng and Ors (1995) 132 ALR 57 at 68.</text>

24 In Saunders , the applicant claimed to have indicated at the time of the execution of the warrant that he reserved his rights to challenge the lawfulness of the seizure. However in Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364, Mullins J held that the right to claim legal professional privilege over documents seized pursuant to a search warrant was not lost because a claim was not made at the time of seizure. Mullins J noted two relevant factors: firstly, that the respondent had been wrongfully informed that he could not contact the solicitors who were acting for him; and secondly, that the claim for privilege was made at the first available opportunity after having spoken with the solicitor acting for him.</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>19 Implied waiver of legal professional privilege was discussed by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1. In that decision, the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) observed (at 13): 
 
 
 'Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is "imputed by operation of law". This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege.'

20 As recognised in the above passage, whether privilege has been impliedly waived depends upon an objective assessment whether conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege, not a consideration of the subjective intention of the party whose confidentiality the privilege protects.

21 In Mann v Carnell , the High Court referred to the case of Benecke v National Australia Bank Ltd (1993) 35 NSWLR 110, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In that case, a woman gave evidence concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings, apparently believing that she could prevent the barrister giving his version of the instructions. The Court of Appeal held that privilege had been impliedly waived. The High Court said of that decision (at 13): 
 
 
 'She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege. She may not even have turned her mind to the question. However, her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.'

22 However both Mann v Carnell and Benecke involved circumstances where the alleged waiver resulted from a voluntary act by the holder of the privilege, albeit an act which was not intended to waive privilege. The present case involves circumstances where documents were provided under compulsion of law. Several authorities have indicated that the considerations in such cases are likely to be different: see Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 473; Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364 at 368-9; Goldberg and Anor v Ng and Ors (1995) 132 ALR 57 at 68.

42 In my opinion, that conduct is inconsistent with the continuation of privilege in the documents seized. I recognise that the right to maintain the confidentiality of legal advice attaches to the applicant rather than to her legal advisor: see Mann v Carnell at [28]. However, in this case, the applicant had instructed Mr O'Brien to advise her in relation to the privilege claim. Mr O'Brien, having knowledge of the seized documents from both Dimocks and the Rosebery premises, did not make a claim for privilege on her behalf. The fact that the documents were being held pending a claim for privilege was drawn to his attention by the facsimile from the AFP. He did not then make a claim for legal professional privilege and accordingly abandoned Robert Norman's claim for privilege. The situation is analogous to that considered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Spedley , where Cole J observed at 729: 
 
 
 '... I am of the opinion that the conduct of Bank of New Zealand in sitting by with knowledge [that material to which a claim for privilege could be made was being used] ... and yet taking no steps to make a claim of privilege on behalf of Bank of New Zealand ... does constitute waiver of legal professional privilege. 
 
 Messrs Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page were advising Bank of New Zealand regarding the $25 million claim. Litigation obviously was a possibility, if not a probability. In those circumstances a solicitor is "the agent of his client in all matters that may reasonably be expected to arise for decision in the cause" (per Denning LJ in Griffiths v Evans [1953] 1 WLR 1424 at 1431 ...).'</text>

<tocase>Spedley Security Ltd (in liq) v Bank of New Zealand (1991) 26 NSWLR 711</tocase>
<text>25 It is clear nonetheless that the failure to claim privilege can in some circumstances constitute a waiver of privilege. In Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) v Bank of New Zealand (1991) 26 NSWLR 711 Cole J found that the respondent had waived legal professional privilege because it had failed to make a claim when it knew that a document had been in the hands of the Registrar of the Court, and possibly in the hands of a third party, for a period of twelve days. Cole J observed at 730: 
 
 
 'There seems to me to be no reason in principle why a party may not, by conduct, waive legal professional privilege by omitting to claim that privilege when it is available. There is no distinction in principle between failure to claim legal professional privilege for a document by including it in a list of documents discovered and available for inspection, without claiming legal professional privilege, and on the other hand sitting by and allowing use of the document already in the hands of the other party without claiming legal professional privilege, or omitting to take steps to claim legal professional privilege in respect of the document known to be in the hands of the court, or as here, the liquidator, which it was obviously intended to use. Each constitutes an implicit waiver because it constitutes an abandonment of the claim for protection (regarding abandonment see Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v Maurice (at 498) per Dawson J).'

26 The claimed waiver in the present case relates to documents seized pursuant to two different search warrants which were executed some months apart. The first search warrant was executed on the Concord premises several months before the documents which are the subject of the present application were seized from Dimocks. The second search warrant was executed on the Rosebery premises several months after the Dimocks documents were seized. Different considerations may apply to the documents seized in each of these two searches, and in my opinion it is appropriate that they be considered separately.

27 The warrant at the Concord premises was executed on 20 May 2005 at which time documents 1(b), 1(d), 1(i) and 1(m) were seized. The applicant made no claim for legal professional privilege in relation to those documents at that time or subsequently. In fact, the applicant has never made a claim for legal professional privilege specifically in relation to the documents seized on 20 May 2005. Rather, the claim is made in respect of the documents seized from Dimocks.

28 The search of Dimocks occurred on 11 November 2005, almost six months after the Concord premises had been searched. Mr Dimock made a claim for legal professional privilege at the time of the search and on 18 November 2005, these proceedings were commenced. However, in the preceding six months, the applicant had made no claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the Concord documents, several of which were identical to the Dimocks documents.

29 The applicant submits that she was unaware of her right to claim legal professional privilege. She points out that a copy of the document outlining the right to claim legal professional privilege was given to her husband, but not to her. She submits also that the PSR which was completed in relation to the Concord search did not describe the documents sufficiently, such that it was not clear that the documents seized were documents to which privilege was likely to attach. She submits that in these circumstances, the fact that she took no action to assert a claim for privilege was not inconsistent with the continuance of the privilege.

42 In my opinion, that conduct is inconsistent with the continuation of privilege in the documents seized. I recognise that the right to maintain the confidentiality of legal advice attaches to the applicant rather than to her legal advisor: see Mann v Carnell at [28]. However, in this case, the applicant had instructed Mr O'Brien to advise her in relation to the privilege claim. Mr O'Brien, having knowledge of the seized documents from both Dimocks and the Rosebery premises, did not make a claim for privilege on her behalf. The fact that the documents were being held pending a claim for privilege was drawn to his attention by the facsimile from the AFP. He did not then make a claim for legal professional privilege and accordingly abandoned Robert Norman's claim for privilege.
