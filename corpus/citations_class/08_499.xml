<tocase>Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/21.html</AustLII>
<text>The first ground of appeal is a restatement of the first ground for judicial review before the Federal Magistrate. It is, as the Federal Magistrate rightly pointed out, no more than a claim to have the Court perform a merits review of the Tribunal's finding. Her Honour dealt extensively with this ground in her reasons. An application for a judicial review of an administrative decision does not give rise to a merits review of the decision: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the Tribunal has exercised its power in accordance with its obligations and, in particular, without jurisdictional error. The Federal Magistrates Court and this Court has limited jurisdiction to determine whether the Tribunal has made jurisdictional error. If no jurisdictional error is shown, then the Tribunal's decision cannot be quashed.

It is not entirely clear what is meant by the second ground of appeal. Her Honour said in her reasons that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to require the Tribunal to write to the applicant pursuant to the provisions of s 424A requiring particular documentary evidence to be adduced. That clearly was right. She also said that if the Tribunal was of the opinion that there was a lack of evidence before the Tribunal, that was not information for the purposes of s 424A. That also is clearly right. The second ground must be dismissed.

It is also not entirely clear what is meant by the third ground, although an examination of her Honour's reasons does assist. It was put to her Honour as part of the third ground in support of the application for judicial review that the Tribunal had erred in questioning why it was that the appellant husband was not subject to further attacks after the home invasion. The Federal Magistrate rejected the argument that such an approach amounted to a consideration of a hypothetical situation or hypothetical issues. The Tribunal gave consideration to the issue which it identified in considering whether or not the appellant husband's account was credible. It was not a hypothetical issue but it was a reason in the Tribunal's opinion why the appellant husband's account could not be accepted.

In my opinion, none of the grounds of appeal have been made out and the appeal must be dismissed. The appellants must pay the respondent's costs.

<tocase>Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/33.html</AustLII>
<text>In Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , the majority said at 7: 
 
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instances to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.

The appellate process is to correct error. If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court. That is undesirable. It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court. If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court, the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed. That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court's point of view.

Moreover, to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court.

In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , the Court said that leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the trial judge should only be granted "if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so." After referring to the dicta in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; 162 CLR 1 , the Court said that the Court may grant leave if the point which has not been raised in the Court below has merit and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting the point to be ventilated.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/105.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the Full Court of this Court has recognised that a residual discretion resides in this Court to allow a party to advance a ground of appeal not advanced before the Court from which the appeal is brought where it is in the interests of justice to do so: Iyer [2000] FCA 1788. In Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 105 ; (2002) 190 ALR 543 , the Full Court adopted the test propounded by the High Court in appeals to that Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; 60 ALR 68 at 71 that a party is bound by the conduct of the party's case in the Court below except in "the most exceptional circumstances".</text>

<text>Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788. It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law. That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43.</text>

<tocase>Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 ; (2001) 192 ALR 71</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/929.html</AustLII>
<text>Rarely will the Minister in an appeal to this Court from a migration judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court be able to point to any prejudice of the conventional kind. That cannot be a reason to allow a party to raise issues not raised in the Court below. In Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 ; (2001) 192 ALR 71 , Gyles J said at 86: 
 
 In my opinion, it is wrong to analyse a question which arises here as requiring a balancing of prejudice. Departure from the proper role of appeal in the court system is not simply a discretionary procedural decision. Furthermore, in public law matters like this, it can always be said that no actual prejudice apart from costs is suffered by the respondent compared with the prejudice to the appellant. It can easily be overlooked that there is a significant public interest in the timely and effective disposal of litigation. This aspect has particular force in this area of public law, where delays in dealing with applications for protection visas are obviously to be avoided if possible. In the present case, there was no bona fide ground of appeal from the primary decision and the litigation should have ended at that point more than 7 months ago.

The Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely disposal of applications for protection visas. There are other public interests, however, to which regard should be had. There are good reasons why this Court should not be made de facto the Court of original jurisdiction when sitting on appeal. Otherwise its role as an intermediate Court of Appeal will be undermined. The High Court should not be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from decisions of this Court which have not been reviewed.

The respondent conceded that I needed to consider whether any of the grounds had any merit before determining whether or not I should allow the application to amend. The concession was rightly made having regard to the decisions of this Court and, in particular, VUAX [2004] FCAFC 158. Adopting that procedure, however, means that in every case where there is an application to raise a ground not previously raised in the Court below, the party seeking to have the ground agitated will by reason of the application itself require the Court to consider the ground. It is a curious result when the Court would otherwise discourage such applications but a result which arises because the Court's overriding duty is to do justice. The reason for the power to allow a party to raise a ground on appeal for the first time is to do justice.</text>

<tocase>Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/28.html</AustLII>
<text>The High Court has made it plain that, ordinarily, a party is confined in its grounds of appeal to matters which have been raised in the Court below. The High Court said in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71: 
 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case has been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so.

However, the Full Court of this Court has recognised that a residual discretion resides in this Court to allow a party to advance a ground of appeal not advanced before the Court from which the appeal is brought where it is in the interests of justice to do so: Iyer [2000] FCA 1788. In Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 105 ; (2002) 190 ALR 543 , the Full Court adopted the test propounded by the High Court in appeals to that Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; 60 ALR 68 at 71 that a party is bound by the conduct of the party's case in the Court below except in "the most exceptional circumstances".

Section 430(1)(c) does not oblige the Tribunal to make findings of fact that a court may consider to be material. In Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 , McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [68]-[69] that the obligation on the Tribunal is to set out in its written statement its findings on what it considered to be material questions of fact.</text>
