<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/85.html</AustLII>
<text>In 2006, Hoy Mobile Pty Limited ( Hoy Mobile ) commenced proceedings in this Court against Allphones. Those proceedings ( the Hoy Mobile proceedings ) were heard in February and March 2008 by Rares J. His Honour delivered reasons for judgment on 30 May 2008 ( Hoy Mobile Pty Limited v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) ATPR 42-240). Allphones appealed from that judgment. On appeal, Allphones was partly successful ( Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 85).</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) (2009) 253 ALR 324</tocase>
<text>Subsequently, in November 2008, in proceedings NSD 1567 of 2008, the ACCC made a further application for interim injunctive relief. The ACCC brought this second application for interlocutory relief in order to address further concerns which it had in relation to the conduct of Allphones in connection with its ongoing negotiations with its franchisees. On 19 January 2009, I delivered judgment in respect of that application ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) (2009) 253 ALR 324). This second interlocutory application is not presently relevant.

At 8.53 am on 9 October 2008, shortly before proceedings NSD 1567 of 2008 were called on before me on that day, the solicitors for the ACCC sent by way of email to my Associate and, at the same time, to the solicitor for Allphones, a document styled Applicant's Submissions in Support of Motion for Interlocutory Injunctions dated 9 October 2008 ( the ACCC's Written Submission ). Plainly, this document was intended to be referred to and relied upon by the ACCC at the interlocutory hearing in those proceedings fixed for that day. At the time when the ACCC's Written Submission was sent, the ACCC's application for interlocutory relief had not been resolved and the ACCC was entitled to assume that that application would proceed at 10.15 am as scheduled. Because the ACCC's claim for interlocutory relief was ultimately resolved on 9 October 2008 on a basis satisfactory to the parties and to the Court, no reference was made to the ACCC's Written Submission in open Court on 9 October 2008 nor was it relied upon by the ACCC on that occasion. I had not previously directed that a written submission be lodged. I did not grant leave to the ACCC to file in Court the ACCC's Written Submission on that occasion, nor was I asked to do so. However, on the same day, the ACCC's Written Submission was marked by my Associate as having been filed in Chambers so that a formal record of the date when the document was received would be made in the Court file. It is the practice of the Court to record the receipt by the Court of a written submission by noting that such a document has been "filed".

A written submission may be filed over the counter at the Registry, in Court (with the leave of the presiding judge) or in Chambers. The ACCC's Written Submission in the present case was marked as "Filed in Chambers" on 9 October 2008. No prior leave had been granted to the ACCC to forward that document to my Chambers.

At the hearing of these proceedings, Allphones submitted that, in pars 6, 13, 14, 15 and 37 of the ACCC's Written Submission, the authors of the document set out certain information which was contained in, or derived from, several monthly management accounts prepared by Allphones in respect of the period from 1 March 2004 to 6 December 2007 ( the Management Accounts ). This submission is correct, at least in respect of some of the paragraphs referred to. Allphones also contended that the Management Accounts and certain other workbooks are confidential internal business records of Allphones and that the information contained in them is confidential to Allphones. Allphones contended that I should find that the only way in which officials of the ACCC might have gained access to this information was by inspecting documents produced to the ACCC by Allphones under compulsion pursuant to a notice served upon Allphones by the ACCC on or about 6 December 2007 pursuant to the provisions of s 155 of the Act ( the s 155 Notice ). On the evidence before me, I am prepared to make that finding.

In the ACCC's Written Submission, Counsel for the ACCC made reference to several paragraphs in an affidavit filed in support of the ACCC's initial interlocutory application and to several documents exhibited to that affidavit. Some of those paragraphs and documents contain material which is of a financial character and which has plainly been derived from financial material furnished to the ACCC by Allphones in response to the s 155 Notice.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/24.html</AustLII>
<text>In order for such a private right to exist, the relevant legislation must be found to reflect a legislative intention to create a private right for breach ( Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 424 425). The question is one of construction of the statute. As submitted by Allphones, it is the statute that creates the right and the common law that supplies the remedy ( Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co Ltd v Long [1957] HCA 26 ; (1957) 97 CLR 36 at 52).

It is by no means clear or beyond argument that the Act creates a private right in Allphones to sue for damages and other relief in the event that an ACCC official discloses information in breach of s 155AAA. There is much to be said for the view that no such right is created (see, in particular, the observations of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Byrne [1995] HCA 24 ; 185 CLR 410 at 458).</text>

<text>As to the question posed in [56(b)] above (the cause of action based upon the breach of the equitable duty of confidence), the following matters are relevant: 
(a) The classic definition of the equitable duty of confidence is found in Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469 at 475. At that part of his reasons, Swinfen Eady LJ said: 
 
The principle upon which the Court of Chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information improperly or surreptitiously obtained or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged. Injunctions have been granted to give effectual relief, that is not only to restrain the disclosure of confidential information, but to prevent copies being made of any record of that information, and, if copies have already been made, to restrain them from being further copied, and to restrain persons into whose possession that confidential information has come from themselves in turn divulging or propagating it.
 
 
These observations were cited with evident approval by Mason J in Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39 at 50; 
 
(b) In the present case, the information was not improperly or surreptitiously obtained. It is contended that it was imparted in confidence in circumstances where it ought not to be divulged; 
 
 (c) The question of whether an equitable duty arises in the present case is not straightforward. The relevant information was contained in documents which were produced pursuant to compulsory powers invoked by the ACCC and in circumstances where it is at least arguable that the only source of any duty of confidence is s 155AAA itself. Although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155AAA and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles, it is difficult to see how a party in the position of Allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the ACCC of its statutory functions. It may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where Allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced. In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 , [2008] ATPR 42-218 , Gordon J, in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds, said (at [30]): 

The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand. 
 
 
and
 
 (d) The definition of protected information seems to me to contemplate a dichotomy between information that is given (voluntarily) in confidence to the ACCC, on the one hand, and information that was obtained by the ACCC (compulsorily) pursuant to a s 155 Notice, on the other hand. In the latter case, the section seems to contemplate that there is no room for any equitable duty of confidence to arise.</text>

<text>Allphones' submissions in support of the discovery order which it claims were developed in detail as follows: 
(a) The correct principles to be applied in the present application are: 
 
(i) First, the applicant must show that, after having made reasonable inquiries, it is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding against that person.
 
 (ii) Second, the applicant must show that 'some person' has or is likely to have knowledge of facts, or the possession of documents, tending to assist in identifying the prospective respondent.
 (iii) Third, the applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent. However, relief of this kind is nevertheless unavailable to a person who intends to commence 'merely speculative proceedings'. This criterion requires the applicant to demonstrate a reasonable objective basis for the proposed claim ( Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 ; Glencore International AG v Selwyn Mines Ltd [2005] FCA 801 ; (2005) 223 ALR 238 at [16] , [91], [96], [105]).
 (iv) Fourth, an applicant under a rule in the form of O 15A r 3 of the Federal Court Rules must show that the order sought is necessary in the interests of justice. That is, the applicant must show that "the making of the order is necessary to provide him with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which be complains". 

(b) Allphones intends to sue the ACCC itself and the official who passed on the ACCC's Written Submission to Birch Partners and to Chew + Matthews for:
 
 (i) Breach of statutory duty. The alleged breach is a breach of s 155AAA(1) of the Act; and
 (ii) Breach of an equitable duty of confidence said to be owed by both the ACCC and the relevant ACCC official to Allphones in respect of Allphones' confidential information (especially its confidential financial information). 

(c) Objectively speaking, there is a reasonable basis for each of the foreshadowed causes of action. The ACCC knows the identity of the relevant ACCC official and has declined to reveal that identity. The disclosure of the identity of that person is in the interests of justice because it is necessary in order to provide Allphones with an effective remedy for the actionable wrongs of which it complains.</text>

The ACCC knows the identity of the relevant ACCC official and has declined to reveal that identity.

The ACCC did not argue that the relevant principles were other than those encapsulated in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; 96 FCR 1 at [31] [34] (pp 10 11). The ACCC also referred me to Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at [3] [7] (pp 168 170). The ACCC resisted Allphones' application on two broad grounds, namely:

The principles upon which that discretion will be exercised were explained by a Full Court of this Court in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; 96 FCR 1 at [31] [34] (pp 10 11) as follows: 
 Order 15A r 3 
 An applicant for relief under O 15A, r 3 must show that, after having made reasonable inquiries, he or she is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding against that person. Order 15A, r 3 plainly contemplates that the applicant needs to ascertain the identity of the relevant person in order to institute a proceeding in the Court against him or her. Secondly, the applicant must show that "some person" has or is likely to have knowledge of facts, or the possession of documents, tending to assist in identifying the prospective respondent. The rule is therefore available even if relief is sought against a person who is in no way implicated in the wrongful conduct of which the applicant complains. In other words, relief is available against a "mere witness" or bystander: Stewart v Miller [1979] 2 NSWLR 128 (Sheppard J), at 135 (a decision on the New South Wales rule). To this extent, the rule differs from the equitable bill of discovery. Thirdly, the applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent: Levis v McDonald at 41, 44; Stewart v Miller at 139-140. Nonetheless, the power conferred by O 15A, r 3 is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence "merely speculative proceedings": Stewart v Miller at 140; Levis v McDonald at 44. A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person he or she wishes to sue: Exley v Wyong Shire Council (unreported, Supreme Court, NSW, Master Allen, 10 December 1976); noted Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure (NSW) par [13,004]. Fourthly, the High Court has emphasised that an applicant under a rule in the form of O 15A, r 3 must show that the order sought is necessary in the interests of justice. That is, the applicant must show that: "the making of the order is necessary to provide him with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he complains." John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; (1988) 165 CLR 346 at 357. These observations emphasise the link between identity discovery and the applicant's complaint that he or she has suffered from an actionable wrong.

In the present case, the debate between the parties has been directed to principles 3 and 4 (as to which see [33] and [34] in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; 96 FCR 1 extracted above).

In Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at [3] [7] (pp 168 170), Finn J said: Order 15A, rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) provide respectively for what is colloquially known as "identity discovery" and "information discovery": see generally Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd (1999) 96 FCR 1. I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where (i) an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person; and (ii) it appears that some other person has, has had, or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is. Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought. It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered. These are that: 
(a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained;
 
(b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and
 
(c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision.
 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court. Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be (a) within federal jurisdiction and (b) in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects. There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements, some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation: see Judiciary Act 1903 Cth, s 39B(1A)(c). It is the latter requirement, which requires the identification of a possible cause of action (in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants), that is problematic. It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following. The O 15A, r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings. A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued: Hooper v Kirella at [33]. Information discovery under O 15A, r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of that rule. Subpara (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court. While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level: see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ; the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one: see Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case, it is not enough merely to assert that there is, or is the mere possibility of, a case against the prospective respondent: Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Importantly, as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26] : 
(d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73].
 While O 15, r 6 expressly contemplates "fishing", it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) must be established. Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves: Airservices Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 at [5] .

The Full Court's judgment in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd 96 FCR 1 is binding upon me. I think that what is required is more than a claim worth investigating. In my judgment, what is required is a claim that is within the jurisdiction of this Court and which is not so near to being hopeless as would reasonably and properly justify the claim being described as "merely speculative". The foreshadowed claim must have some prospect of succeeding. Success in this context requires a cause of action known to the law and a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect that some remedy might be granted. If the foreshadowed proceedings would almost certainly be susceptible to an order for dismissal pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), then preliminary discovery would ordinarily not be ordered. This is the flavour of the remarks of Jacobson J in Wyeth 255 ALR 352 at [24] [29].</text>

 Order 15A r 3 
 An applicant for relief under O 15A, r 3 must show that, after having made reasonable inquiries, he or she is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding against that person. Order 15A, r 3 plainly contemplates that the applicant needs to ascertain the identity of the relevant person in order to institute a proceeding in the Court against him or her. Secondly, the applicant must show that "some person" has or is likely to have knowledge of facts, or the possession of documents, tending to assist in identifying the prospective respondent. The rule is therefore available even if relief is sought against a person who is in no way implicated in the wrongful conduct of which the applicant complains. In other words, relief is available against a "mere witness" or bystander: Stewart v Miller [1979] 2 NSWLR 128 (Sheppard J), at 135 (a decision on the New South Wales rule). To this extent, the rule differs from the equitable bill of discovery. Thirdly, the applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent: Levis v McDonald at 41, 44; Stewart v Miller at 139-140. Nonetheless, the power conferred by O 15A, r 3 is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence "merely speculative proceedings": Stewart v Miller at 140; Levis v McDonald at 44. A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person he or she wishes to sue: Exley v Wyong Shire Council (unreported, Supreme Court, NSW, Master Allen, 10 December 1976); noted Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure (NSW) par [13,004]. Fourthly, the High Court has emphasised that an applicant under a rule in the form of O 15A, r 3 must show that the order sought is necessary in the interests of justice. That is, the applicant must show that: "the making of the order is necessary to provide him with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he complains." John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; (1988) 165 CLR 346 at 357. These observations emphasise the link between identity discovery and the applicant's complaint that he or she has suffered from an actionable wrong.

A judge called upon to decide whether an order for preliminary discovery should be made must consider whether the applicant will be left without an effective remedy if an order is not made ( John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; (1988) 165 CLR 346 at 357). Although the judge is not called upon to decide the foreshadowed proceedings in order to determine the discovery question, he or she is required to consider whether the foreshadowed claims are devoid of prospects. This may require the judge to form a conclusion as to whether or not a particular defence might well succeed on the materials before him or her ( John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; 165 CLR 346 at 357).

In the present case, the two matters which must be considered are:

The two questions are related.

As to the question posed in [56(a)] above, Allphones relies upon two potential causes of action as against the relevant ACCC official. These are:

The statutory duty alleged to have been breached is that which is contained in s 155AAA(1) of the Act. That subsection is in the following terms: 
 155AAA Protection of certain information 
 (1) A Commission official must not disclose any protected information to any person except: 

(a) when the Commission official is performing duties or functions as a Commission official; or
 
(b) when the Commission official or the Commission is required or permitted by:
 
(i) this Act or any other law of the Commonwealth; or
 
(ii) a prescribed law of a State or internal Territory;
 
to disclose the information.

This is a case where it is difficult to see the evidentiary matrix altering much if at all were the substantive issue to be litigated. The position is analogous to the circumstances under discussion in the passages from John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojuangco [1988] HCA 54 ; 165 CLR 346 to which I have referred at [55] above.

Further, I think that the ACCC's Written Submission is a "written submission" within the meaning of O 46 r 6(2)(g) of the Federal Court Rules and that, for that reason, it was already "publicly available" within the meaning of s 155AAA(16) of the Act by 14 October 2008.

Allphones submitted that the document was not a written submission because:</text>

<tocase>Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469</tocase>
<text>As to the question posed in [56(b)] above (the cause of action based upon the breach of the equitable duty of confidence), the following matters are relevant: 
(a) The classic definition of the equitable duty of confidence is found in Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469 at 475. At that part of his reasons, Swinfen Eady LJ said: 
 
The principle upon which the Court of Chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information improperly or surreptitiously obtained or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged. Injunctions have been granted to give effectual relief, that is not only to restrain the disclosure of confidential information, but to prevent copies being made of any record of that information, and, if copies have already been made, to restrain them from being further copied, and to restrain persons into whose possession that confidential information has come from themselves in turn divulging or propagating it.
 
 
These observations were cited with evident approval by Mason J in Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39 at 50; 
 
(b) In the present case, the information was not improperly or surreptitiously obtained. It is contended that it was imparted in confidence in circumstances where it ought not to be divulged; 
 
 (c) The question of whether an equitable duty arises in the present case is not straightforward. The relevant information was contained in documents which were produced pursuant to compulsory powers invoked by the ACCC and in circumstances where it is at least arguable that the only source of any duty of confidence is s 155AAA itself. Although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155AAA and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles, it is difficult to see how a party in the position of Allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the ACCC of its statutory functions. It may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where Allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced. In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 , [2008] ATPR 42-218 , Gordon J, in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds, said (at [30]): 

The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand. 
 
 
and
 
 (d) The definition of protected information seems to me to contemplate a dichotomy between information that is given (voluntarily) in confidence to the ACCC, on the one hand, and information that was obtained by the ACCC (compulsorily) pursuant to a s 155 Notice, on the other hand. In the latter case, the section seems to contemplate that there is no room for any equitable duty of confidence to arise.</text>

<text>The ACCC did not argue that the relevant principles were other than those encapsulated in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; 96 FCR 1 at [31] [34] (pp 10 11). The ACCC also referred me to Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at [3] [7] (pp 168 170). The ACCC resisted Allphones' application on two broad grounds, namely:

In Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at [3] [7] (pp 168 170), Finn J said: Order 15A, rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) provide respectively for what is colloquially known as "identity discovery" and "information discovery": see generally Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd (1999) 96 FCR 1. I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where (i) an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person; and (ii) it appears that some other person has, has had, or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is. Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought. It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered. These are that: 
(a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained;
 
(b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and
 
(c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision.
 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court. Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be (a) within federal jurisdiction and (b) in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects. There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements, some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation: see Judiciary Act 1903 Cth, s 39B(1A)(c). It is the latter requirement, which requires the identification of a possible cause of action (in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants), that is problematic. It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following. The O 15A, r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings. A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued: Hooper v Kirella at [33]. Information discovery under O 15A, r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of that rule. Subpara (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court. While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level: see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ; the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one: see Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case, it is not enough merely to assert that there is, or is the mere possibility of, a case against the prospective respondent: Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Importantly, as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26] : 
(d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73].
 While O 15, r 6 expressly contemplates "fishing", it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) must be established. Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves: Airservices Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 at [5] .</text>

<tocase>Wyeth v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing (2009) 255 ALR 352</tocase>
<text>In Wyeth v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing (2009) 255 ALR 352 at [24] [29] (pp 355 356) Jacobson J described the test as being "... along the same lines as that which applies to a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief ". His Honour went on to say that consideration of that test was connected to the identification of the interests of justice.

The Full Court's judgment in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd 96 FCR 1 is binding upon me. I think that what is required is more than a claim worth investigating. In my judgment, what is required is a claim that is within the jurisdiction of this Court and which is not so near to being hopeless as would reasonably and properly justify the claim being described as "merely speculative". The foreshadowed claim must have some prospect of succeeding. Success in this context requires a cause of action known to the law and a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect that some remedy might be granted. If the foreshadowed proceedings would almost certainly be susceptible to an order for dismissal pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), then preliminary discovery would ordinarily not be ordered. This is the flavour of the remarks of Jacobson J in Wyeth 255 ALR 352 at [24] [29].</text>
