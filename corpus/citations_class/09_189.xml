<tocase>Bird v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 23 ; (1988) 165 CLR 1</tocase>

<text>Further, the continued interest must be one "of that kind". In context, the reference in cl 845.213(b) to "of that kind" is, in my opinion, to be read as a reference to the "main business" or businesses referred to in cl 845.213(a). The use of "kind" in drafting might in other contexts admit of a more generic coverage. The embrace of the word has given rise in other contexts to sharp divisions of judicial opinion, see, for example, Bird v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 23 ; (1988) 165 CLR 1. Here though, "kind" is governed not by an indefinite but by a very specific definite article, "that". It is also necessary to recall that "main business" is itself a defined term. One feature of that definition, to which I have already referred, is a limit on the number of businesses which may be nominated as a "main business". To give "of that kind" an open ended, generic construction so as to embrace yet another business, albeit one akin to that or those nominated, would be to subvert: 
(a) The limitation found in the definition of "main business"; and
 
(b) The very managerial particular involvement, found in para (1)(b) of the definition, required for a business to be a "main business".

There is no obvious reason for such subversion in respect of this particular visa subclass. On the other hand, construing "of that kind" as a reference to the "main business" or businesses referred to in cl 845.213(a) sits comfortably with a subclass the intent of which seems to be to provide a basis for the granting of a visa to those (and to the family of those) who have made a significant and continuing investment in and managerial involvement with at least one and not more than two nominated main businesses in Australia.

Another feature of para (1)(b) of the definition of "main business" in reg 1.11 of the Regulations is that it is activity related. Furthermore, the language employed in respect of the activity is "maintains or has maintained continuous involvement". Necessarily, the determining of whether at the time of decision the requirements of this paragraph are met requires an assessment of an activity over a continuum. What has the visa applicant been doing in relation to the "main business" or businesses since the date of application? Further, the requirements specified in the paragraphs of the definition are cumulative.</text>

<text>Unlike the circumstances of Saffron's Case, the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court was in no sense an appeal by way of rehearing where a particular point had not been taken in a court below. Rather, it was a judicial review proceeding in respect of the Tribunal's decision. Further, having regarding to s 65 of the Act, it was a judicial review proceeding in respect of an ultimate conclusion by the Tribunal, sitting in place of the ministerial delegate, that it was not "satisfied" that the relevant criteria for the grant of the visa sought were met. Such "satisfaction" based decisions are not unexaminable on judicial review, as the High Court noted in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-276 by reference with approval to remarks on that subject made by Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1975) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119.</text>

<tocase>Nassif v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 481 ; (2003) 129 FCR 448</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/481.html</AustLII>
<text>In the Federal Magistrates Court, the Appellant's contention was that it was not lawfully possible for the Tribunal to have concluded that the meaning of the word "business" in the definition of "main business" was such that, even though several types of enterprise might be discernable in its operations, there could in law only be one "business" carried on by that legal entity. In disposing of that contention, the learned Federal Magistrate noted that in Nassif v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 481 ; (2003) 129 FCR 448 Branson J, having observed that the word "business" was not defined for the purposes of the Regulations, derived assistance as to its meaning as found in standard dictionaries. In that case her Honour concluded that it was not a characteristic of the meaning of the word "business" that a business could only be carried on by one legal entity. The learned Federal Magistrate considered that the converse of this also followed from the word's ordinary meaning, ie that a single legal entity could also carry on more than one "business" (reasons for judgment, para 41). Having reached that conclusion, his Honour then found that it was open to the Tribunal, as a matter of fact, to conclude that GNI operated two businesses.

There was no error in the way in which the learned Federal Magistrate approached the meaning of the word "business" and its reach. As did Branson J in Nassif (at 454-455), I gain assistance as to the meaning the word from standard dictionaries. The word undoubtedly has chameleon like qualities, taking its meaning from the context in which it is used. In both the Oxford and the Macquarie Dictionaries the meaning of the word "business", when used in a commercial sense, is "enterprise". That is the sense in which it is used in the terms "main business" and "qualifying business" in the Regulations. That this is so is reinforced by its being treated, in the definition of "qualifying business", as a synonym for "enterprise".

So construed, there is nothing about the meaning of the word "business" as used in the context of the Regulations which carries with it the necessary corollary that a legal entity can only ever, on its true meaning, have or conduct but one "business". Such a construction of the word "business" accords with common experience. It is by no means unusual for a legal entity to cease one particular field of commercial endeavour by the disposal of what is aptly termed a "business" without ceasing altogether to trade.

Given this meaning of the word, whether or not GNI had one or two "main businesses" was nothing more than a question of fact and one for the Tribunal alone. The learned Federal Magistrate well appreciated this (reasons for judgement, para 44). It is certainly not one this Court on subsequent appeal.</text>

<tocase>Rao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1755</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1755.html</AustLII>
<text>In the Federal Magistrates Court attention centred upon whether the words "continues to" ought to be afforded the meaning given to those same words in another clause of Sch 2 to the Regulations by Allsop J (as his Honour then was) in Rao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1755 ( Rao's Case)or that which commended itself to a Full Court in Xiang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 301 ( Xiang's Case) in respect of like words in yet another clause in Sch 2 to the Regulations. In the result, the learned Federal Magistrate considered that contextual similarities as between the words as used in cl 845 and as used in the provisions considered in Rao's Case favoured following the construction of "continues to" adopted in that case rather than, as the Appellant had submitted, that given to those same words by the Full Court in Xiang's Case

The following passage from Xiang's Case, which was cited by the learned Federal Magistrate, sets out the views of the Full Court with respect to the meaning of the words "continues to", as well as that earlier voiced by Allsop J in Rao's Case: 
 [8] The tribunal also fell into error in the meaning it placed on the word "continues" in subcl 806.221 of the Regulations. According to the tribunal it means that a visa applicant must do more than establish that he or she is a special need relative at the time of application and at the time of decision. It also requires the applicant to satisfy this definition throughout the entire intervening period, or at least for a substantial part of that period. According to the tribunal "[t]o hold otherwise would deny any use or purpose to the inclusion of the word 'continues' in the regulations". Although not the subject of complaint, it should be noted that the tribunal said that unless an applicant was a special need relative during the period between the time of the application and the time of decision, the applicant would not satisfy subcl 806.213 of the Regulations. Even if the tribunal were correct in its construction (which it is not, for reasons soon to be explained), it was wrong to hold that this would result in a failure to satisfy subcl 806.213. It could only lead the tribunal to the conclusion that the visa applicant had failed to satisfy subcl 806.221, namely the criteria at the time of decision, and not that she had failed to do so at the time of the application. 

 
 [9] Returning to the meaning of the word "continues" in subcl 806.221, that meaning cannot be considered in isolation. Its meaning must be gathered from the context. The context is that a visa applicant must be a "special need relative" both at the time of application, and at the time of decision, to satisfy that criteria. It will be remembered that a special need relative is defined as a relative who is willing and able to provide the requisite assistance to an Australian or New Zealand citizen or resident. The first point to note is that the word to be construed is the verb "continues" and not the adjective "continuing". Second, it is plain that the word "continues" is not concerned with any activity on the part of the visa applicant, but rather with the applicant's status; a status which has a temporal condition. 

 
 [10] Finally, the question whether the applicant meets the criteria at the time of application and at the time of decision is determined at the time of decision. Relevantly, the question is whether the applicant was (at the time of application) and still is (at the time of decision) a "special need relative". That is to say, the applicant "continues" that status if the applicant still is a "special need relative" at a particular time; that time being when the decision is made. Possibly the draftsman assumed that a person who was a "special need relative" at the time of the application and continues to satisfy that condition on the day of decision would be a "special need relative" throughout the intervening period. But, whatever may be the assumption, there is no legal requirement that this be so. This conclusion is probably inconsistent with the decision in Rao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1755.There on a slightly differently worded regulation Allsop J decided that the word "continues" was not intended to limit the enquiry whether the visa applicant in that case had satisfied the relevant criteria at the time of the decision. On the other hand, the judgment in that case may be supported because the word "continues" was used in a different context. This issue need not be resolved.

The relevant visa class considered in Xiang's Case is evident from the passage quoted. The "slightly differently worded regulation" considered by Allsop J in Rao's Case was that part of the Regulations which governed eligibility for the Student (Temporary) (Class TU Subclass 560) visa sought by the visa applicant in that case. One condition to which that applicant's existing visa was subject was condition 8105, which prescribed that the holder must not engage in work in Australia (other than in relation to her course of study or training) for more than 20 hours per week during any week when the institution at which the holder was studying was in session. Within Subclass 560, cl 560.21 set out the criteria to be satisfied at the time of application. Subclause 560.22 set out the criteria to be satisfied at the time of decision. Subclause 560.213 provided: 
 If the application is made in Australia, the applicant has complied substantially with the conditions to which the visa (if any) held, or last held, by the applicant is, or was, subject. 

In turn, cl 560.227 provided:
 
 If the application is made in Australia, the applicant continues to satisfy the criterion in cl560.213. [Emphasis added] 

There was a finding of fact at tribunal level in Rao's Case that, in the interval between date of application and date of decision, the visa applicant had consistently breached the working hours limitation.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Warren (2008) 167 FCR 511</tocase>
<text>In Repatriation Commission v Warren (2008) 167 FCR 511 ( Warren's Case), Lindgren and Bennett JJ (with whom in this regard I agreed) comprehensively summarised the effect of earlier authorities bearing upon the question as to whether an External Merits Review Tribunal commits legal error by not considering an issue even if it is not raised or the subject of challenge by the parties to the review proceeding before it. Their Honours stated (para 78): The following principles, which we take to be established, must be understood against the background that the tribunal under consideration, like the Tribunal here, is required to "review" a primary decision, is given all the powers and discretions that were conferred on the original decision-maker, is not bound by the rules of evidence, is required to proceed with little formality and technicality, and is, of course, bound to apply the provisions of the relevant statute, even if there is no challenge by the parties: The general rule that a litigant is bound by, and accordingly is entitled to act on, admissions and concessions does not automatically apply, although cases concerned with the exercise of judicial power may be of assistance ( Kuswardana at 194 per Bowen CJ). A party to the proceeding is not necessarily precluded from arguing on "appeal" matters that were conceded before the tribunal. Whether the party is so precluded depends on the nature of the matter conceded, its conduct of its case, whether the concession represented an agreement by the parties as to the facts to be decided and other relevant circumstances ( Kuswardana at 195 per Bowen CJ and at 199 per Fox J). Where a concession is made, there must be some difficulty in finding an "error of law" when the contrary of the concession is raised for the first time in this Court ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raptis (1989) 20 ATR 1262 at 1267 per Gummow J). A tribunal does not err in law in failing to regard as material a fact which counsel failed in submissions to contend was material ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Perkins (1993) 26 ATR 8 at 10 per Davies J). There is a difference between factual matters not canvassed before the tribunal and a new issue relating to the validity of a regulation ( Tefonu Pty Ltd v Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner [1993] FCA 412 ; (1993) 44 FCR 361 at 367 per Beazley J). Even though the parties may be ' able, in practical terms, to narrow the issues by concession ... even a concession does not permit the [t]ribunal to avoid its duty as an administrative decision-maker to make the correct or preferable decision ... on all relevant aspects of the matter before it ' ( Peacock v Repatriation Commission (2007) 161 FCR 256 at [23]); A concession ' does, however, permit the decision-maker to reach the correct or preferable decision by reference to the concession as well as to its findings on disputed questions ' ( Peacock at[23]; and see Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328 at 337 338). The Court will more readily permit a matter to be raised for the first time in this Court on an appeal from a tribunal where: 
(a) the matter is a pure question of law, such as a question as to the validity of a regulation ( Kuswardana at 195; Tefonu at 367) or a question as to whether the tribunal had applied the correct standard of proof on the true construction and application of legislation ( Ferriday at 527 528 per Lee J);
 
(b) the matter goes to a misapprehension that was shared by the parties before the tribunal and therefore by the tribunal itself ( Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd v Commissioner for ACT Revenue [1994] FCA 1150 ; (1994) 50 FCR 405 at 418-419 per Wilcox J) such as a shared misapprehension as to the applicable law (cf Thomas at 120 per Beazley J); or 
 
(c) the matter goes to a condition precedent to the availability of a power, the exercise of which will have a serious impact on the individual ( Kuswardana ) .

Of the propositions summarised in the passage quoted from Warren's case, the present is but an example of a case where a Tribunal has not erred in law by failing to regard as material a fact which the representative of a party before it failed in submissions to contend was material. A finding by the Tribunal that each of the businesses nominated on the visa application form by the Appellant as a "main business" was indeed a "main business" necessarily, in the circumstances, carried with it a finding, a "satisfaction", that each business, factually, met the definition of "qualifying business".</text>

<tocase>Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1958/50.html</AustLII>
<text>It seems from the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that, in the course of oral submissions, the Appellant also advanced a case, which was not revealed by the grounds of judicial review that it had specified, that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider whether each of the "main businesses" was a "qualifying business". The learned Federal Magistrate noted (reasons for judgment, para 51) that neither party had put before the Tribunal matters relevant to establishing a "qualifying business" which was a subject "taken as said". His Honour then opined (reasons for judgment, para 52), by reference to Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231 ( Saffron's Case ), "The matter never having been put in issue before this time cannot now be raised".

On the appeal to this Court, the Appellant's submission was that the Tribunal had erred because it did not properly turn its mind to the question of whether the two businesses specified on the visa application form were "qualifying businesses" as defined by reg 1.03 of the Regulations. It was submitted that only by so doing could the Tribunal properly have determined that those businesses were separate "main businesses" for the purposes of reg 1.1(2) of the Regulations. From this it was said to follow that the rejection of United's business as a "main business" was erroneous because it did not violate the regulatory prohibition against the nomination of more than two "main businesses". In turn, the learned Federal Magistrate was said to have fallen into error by failing to hold that the identified alleged error on the part of the Tribunal was jurisdictional.

The learned Federal Magistrate was also submitted erroneously to have concluded that, because the question of whether the originally specified main businesses were qualifying businesses had not been raised before the Tribunal, it could not be raised as a jurisdictional error ground before the Federal Magistrates Court. The Appellant submitted that "the failure of the Tribunal to even turn its mind to the question of whether the main businesses nominated on the visa application form were 'qualifying businesses', was a fundamental failure to understand the task before it".

The Appellant contended that the reference by the learned Magistrate to Saffron 's Case was inapt. With respect, I agree.</text>

<tocase>Xiang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 301</tocase>
<text>In the Federal Magistrates Court attention centred upon whether the words "continues to" ought to be afforded the meaning given to those same words in another clause of Sch 2 to the Regulations by Allsop J (as his Honour then was) in Rao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1755 ( Rao's Case)or that which commended itself to a Full Court in Xiang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 301 ( Xiang's Case) in respect of like words in yet another clause in Sch 2 to the Regulations. In the result, the learned Federal Magistrate considered that contextual similarities as between the words as used in cl 845 and as used in the provisions considered in Rao's Case favoured following the construction of "continues to" adopted in that case rather than, as the Appellant had submitted, that given to those same words by the Full Court in Xiang's Case

The learned Federal Magistrate was keenly aware of the authority of a decision of a Full Court of this Court, if in point, as the following passage reveals. I cite it not only to highlight this but also because it evidences a correct understanding by his Honour of the language actually employed in cl 845.221 and the essence of why his Honour preferred the meaning given to the words "continues to" in Rao's Case: 
 [75] It follows that for the decision in Xiang to be binding the context in which the word "continues" is used has to be materially similar to the context in that case. In my view for reasons which follow the context in which the word "continues" appears in clause 845.221 is not similar to the context to which the word appeared in clause 806.221. 

Though His Honour's use of the word "continuous" both before and after this passage was unfortunate, this passage is pivotal in his reasons for judgment. Noting this, and reading the reasons as a whole, I am not persuaded that the erroneous references to "continuous" were material to his Honour's interpretative conclusion. What was material was the learned Federal Magistrate's apprehension that it had been recognised in Xiang's Case that the meaning to give to the word "continues" may depend on whether it was used in relation to a status or an activity. It was because his Honour considered that it was used in the latter context that he concluded that, in this regard, there had been no error made by the Tribunal.

The requirement for a duality of satisfaction by a visa applicant of particular criteria at both the time of application and the time of decision is not unique to cl 845, nor even to those considered in Xiang's Case and Rao's Case. It is a feature which permeates the Regulations. It is a further permeating feature that the verb "continues" is employed so as to require satisfaction on the part of the administrative decision maker at the time of decision that a visa applicant "continues to" satisfy nominated criteria which were first required to be satisfied at the time of application.

Against this background, it is highly unlikely, in my opinion, that it was intended by the Governor-General-in-Council when making and amending the Regulations that the meaning, as opposed to the effect in context, of "continues to" would vary throughout those regulations.</text>
