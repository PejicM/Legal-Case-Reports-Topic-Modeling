<tocase>Roncevich v Repatriation Commission (2005) 222 CLR 115</tocase>
<text>Sections 68(1), 69 and 70(1) of the Entitlements Act have the effect that the Commonwealth is liable to pay in accordance with the Entitlements Act a pension by way of compensation to the dependants of a member of the Forces who has served continuous full-time service after 6 December 1972 and before 7 April 1994 for a period of three continuous years, where the death of the member was defence-caused. Section 70(5)(a) of the Entitlements Act provides that the death of a member shall be taken to have been defence-caused if the death arose out of or was attributable to any defence service of the member. The use of the disjunction in the phrase manifests a legislative intention to give the term defence-caused a broad meaning and s 70(5)(a) does not import any notion of sole or dominant or direct or proximate attribution: Roncevich v Repatriation Commission (2005) 222 CLR 115 at [27] per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Smith (1987) 15 FCR 327</tocase>
<text>Section 120(4) of the Entitlements Act provides that in making any determination or decision in respect of a matter arising under the Entitlements Act or Regulations (other than a determination to which s 120(1) or (2) applies, and those subsections do not apply here), the statutory standard to be applied by the decision-maker is a standard of "reasonable satisfaction" which adopts the civil standard: Repatriation Commission v Smith (1987) 15 FCR 327 per Northrop, Beaumont and Spender JJ.

Therefore, if the decision-maker is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Heathcote's death was attributable to any defence service on his part, the death is taken to be defence-caused. However, s 120B(1)(b) has the effect of applying s 120B to Mrs Heathcote's claim made under s 70(1) of the Entitlements Act. That being so, s 120B(3) thus applies and provides that in applying s 120(4) to determine a claim, the Commission is to be reasonably satisfied that the death of a person was defence-caused only if: 
 
 (a) the material before the Commission raises a connection between the ... death of the person and some particular service rendered by the person; and 
 

 
 
 (b) there is in force: 
 

 
 
 (i) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(3) or (12); or 
 

 
 
 (ii) a determination of the Commission under subsection 180A(3); 
 

 
 
 that upholds the contention that the ... death of the person is, on the balance of probabilities, connected with that service. 
 

 
 
 [emphasis added]

Section 196A of the Entitlements Act establishes the Repatriation Medical Authority and s 196B provides that the main function of the Authority is to determine Statements of Principles for the purposes of the Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (Cth). Section 196B(3) is in these terms: 
 
 If the Authority is of the view that on the sound medical-scientific evidence available it is more probable than not that a particular kind of injury, disease or death can be related to: 
 

 
 
 (a) ... 
 

 
 
 (b) defence service ... rendered by members of the Forces; or 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 the Authority must determine a Statement of Principles in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death setting out: 
 

 
 
 (c) the factors that must exist; and 
 

 
 
 (d) which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person; 
 

 
 
 before it can be said that, on the balance of probabilities, an injury, disease or death of that kind is connected with the circumstances of that service.</text>

<tocase>Judge v Repatriation Commission [2002] AATA 420</tocase>
<text>Plainly, Dr Levy was directing his mind to the controversy on the facts, based on the medical evidence, as to whether and if so when, M G U S was present in Mr Heathcote. At [23], Dr Levy referred to the careful analysis of Dr Grant and the expert assessments of Dr Choo. Dr Levy noted the "uncertainty" on this question and the evidence of Dr Davison as the treating cardiologist and the opinion of Dr Catalano. At [24], Dr Levy referred to other information that had assisted the Tribunal in understanding the "differentiation between MGUS and myeloma" consisting of an extract from Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (13 th Ed., 2) Part II , Section 1 , "Disorders of the Immune System, Plasma Cell Disorders of the Immune System, Plasma Cell Disorders", cited in Judge v Repatriation Commission [2002] AATA 420, and said: 
 
 The evidence of Associate Professor Marion Woods was also of considerable assistance in understanding the complexities of the condition and the difficulty in determining the likely path of the disease in any particular case.

At [25], Dr Levy noted that the view of Dr Woods was essentially supportive of the opinions of Dr Davison and Dr Catalano and at [26], Dr Levy found: 
 
 While the evidence of Professor Woods cumulatively with that of Dr Davison and Dr Catalano is more persuasive than Dr [Choo's] conclusion, I accept Professor Woods' opinion as it is also supported by empirical evidence which is more likely to explain the comparatively earlier death of Mr Heathcote compared to others with this condition. That empirical evidence shows that progression to AL Amyloidosis is 8.4 times more likely where MGUS is present and the pattern of the debilitating illness of Mr Heathcote tends to indicate some abnormal factor was present to explain the acceleration of the disease and particularly in someone who died at 42 years of age whereas the expected median age is closer to 60 years of age.

Accordingly, Dr Levy found in reliance upon the persuasive evidence of Dr Woods, Dr Davison and Dr Catalano, and particularly the evidence of Dr Woods, that Mr Heathcote was suffering from a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance which had accelerated the progression of AL amyloidosis explaining the comparatively early death of Mr Heathcote at 42.</text>

<tocase>SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 77 ALD 402</tocase>
<text>The resolution of the final question involved a finding of fact or findings of facts from which inferences might be drawn as to the ultimate question in issue. If there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing any inference upon which the Tribunal has relied, an error of law arises. As to findings "unsupported by any evidence", see SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 77 ALD 402 per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ. Want of logic or faulty logic on the part of the Tribunal is not synonymous with error of law. As to inferences that might be drawn, so long as the particular inference is reasonably open even if the inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no error of law: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi (2001) 65 ALD 141. As to the "no evidence" ground see SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32].</text>

<tocase>Collins v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 90; (2009) 177 FCR 280</tocase>
<text>The Commission accepts that Mr Heathcote died from cardiomyopathy and therefore the Statement of Principles concerning cardiomyopathy applies. The Commission also accepts that factor (p) is made out as Mr Heathcote's myocardium had been infiltrated by amyloid material by reason of a specified disorder, namely, amyloidosis. Since factor (p) exists, it is open to the decision-maker to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Heathcote's death from cardiomyopathy is connected with the circumstances of his defence service provided that the final question is answered in the affirmative. That question is whether Mr Heathcote's death from amyloid cardiomyopathy, being the specified disorder contemplated by the Statement of Principles, was, on the balance of probabilities, related to the defence service rendered by Mr Heathcote in the sense that it arose out of or was attributable to that service (s 196B(14); Collins v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 90; (2009) 177 FCR 280 at [46]; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 91; (2009) 177 FCR 434 at [24]). That might be so if Mr Heathcote's M G U S was attributable to his defence service and M G U S gave rise to the development of amyloidosis causing amyloid cardiomyopathy and death.</text>
