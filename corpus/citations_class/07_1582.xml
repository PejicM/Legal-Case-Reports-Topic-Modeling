<tocase>Re APN News &amp; Media Limited (2007) 62 ACSR 400</tocase>
<text>32 Lastly, he brought to my attention the provision in the agreement which deems the ordinary shareholder to have warranted to Bendigo Bank that their ordinary shares are fully paid and free from encumbrances. The purpose of the clause was adverted to by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [59]-[60]:
 
 59 In substance, the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances, without any obligation, in effect, to refund to INMAL the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. It is not practicable for amounts secured by encumbrance to be deducted from the scheme consideration payable to the relevant scheme participants on the implementation date.
 
 60 The warranty will be deemed to have been given, not only by those offeree shareholders who vote to agree to the scheme, and who, therefore, can be seen to be consenting to give it, but also those who do not vote at all or who vote against the scheme. However, I do not think that this matters. What is important, in my view, is that the deemed warranty is no more than a device directed to ensuring that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty is the amount required to discharge the encumbrance.

33 All three matters raised by Mr Bathurst QC were addressed by Lindgren J in this Court in Re APN News and Media Limited 62 ACSR 400. In all three instances, his Honour found that similar clauses in similar transactions were no bar to the implementation of the proposed transactions. I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasons.

34 I am further satisfied that the directors have unanimously recommended the schemes of arrangement to all three classes of members of the plaintiff and that in doing so they have not acted otherwise than in accordance with their duties. I am satisfied that an appropriate independent expert's report was obtained and that the opinion expressed is that held by the author.

35 I am also satisfied that the plaintiff put in place a due diligence committee which has rigorously examined the proposed merger.</text>

<tocase>Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 758</tocase>
<text>30 On the hearing of this application today, Mr Bathurst QC, who led for the plaintiff, brought to my attention three particular aspects of the proposed schemes of arrangement. First, he drew my attention to the exclusivity transaction and the "no shop/no talk" provision of the proposed merger. He also drew my attention to the fiduciary carve-out provision within the merger implementation agreement. The "no shop/no talk" provision is an unremarkable term commercially. It satisfies the criteria Santow J adduced in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 758. In my opinion, it is not a term which would make the proposed scheme of arrangement such that it ought not be submitted to its members.

31 Secondly, he brought to my attention the terms of the agreement relating to a break fee. In relation to the break fee, he emphasised that there was a break fee payable by both parties to the transaction. Both the plaintiff and the Bendigo Bank must pay a break fee in the sum of $15 million if the transaction does not go ahead for any of the reasons given in the proposed scheme. The break fee is less than 1% of the plaintiff's market capitalisation of $1.6 billion which is within the Australian Takeovers Panel's Guidance Notes: Guidance Note 7: Lock-up Devices (2 nd issue, 2005). In any event, the break fee is not payable in circumstances where the members vote not to implement the scheme. In those circumstances, the break fee is not a disincentive to the shareholders in their consideration of the proposed merger.</text>

<tocase>Re Bank of Adelaide (1979) 22 SASR 481</tocase>
<text>14 I am satisfied that that criteria has been established. The plaintiff is a Part 5.1 body as defined in s 9 of the Corporations Act . A scheme of arrangement of the kind proposed is a compromise or arrangement within the meaning of s 411: Re Bank of Adelaide (1979) 22 SASR 481. Subject therefore to the other subsections of ss 411 and 412 , the plaintiff is entitled to seek the exercise of the Court's discretion and make the orders.

15 Two preconditions for the exercise of the power in s 411 are provided for in s 411(2). First, pursuant to s 411(2)(a) , the Court is not entitled to make an order under s 411(1) unless 14 days notice of the hearing of the application, or such lesser period of notice as the Court or ASIC permits, has been given to ASIC. I am satisfied on the evidence that 14 days notice of the application has been given to ASIC.

16 Secondly, s 411(2)(b) of the Corporations Act prevents the Court from making an order unless satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the terms of the proposed compromise or arrangement and to make submissions to the Court in relation to the proposed compromise or arrangement, and the draft Explanatory Statement.</text>

<text>38 The criteria referred to by Emmett J in Re Central Pacific Minerals N.L. [2002] FCA 239 and approved by Conti J in Re CSR Ltd (2003) 45 ACSR 34 at 36-37 have been met. The plaintiff has conformed with Santow J's test in Re NRMA Insurance Ltd (2003) 33 ACSR 523.

41 I am satisfied, as Conti J was in Re CSR Ltd 45 ACSR 34, that the marginally different treatment of the ineligible foreign shareholders does not raise an issue as to the proper formation of classes of members affected by the scheme.

42 For those reasons, it would be appropriate to make the orders sought on the application and to appoint a further date for the consideration as to whether the Court should, if the members have so resolved, approve the schemes of arrangement.

43 For those reasons, I make the orders in the short minutes of order this day initialled by me.

 I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.
