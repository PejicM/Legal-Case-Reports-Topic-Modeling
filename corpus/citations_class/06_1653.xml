<text>27 In VQAN , Heerey J concluded that even where there is no satisfactory explanation, the prospects of success of the appeal are relevant to the decision to grant an extension of time. His Honour noted that McHugh J had said in Marks at [13], with reference to his earlier judgment in Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479, that '[a] "case would need to be exceptional" before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months '.</text>

<text>3 That is not the end of the matter, however, as the Court has a discretion to grant or refuse the extension of time sought if special reasons exist. Relevant factors include the importance of the question sought to be raised by the proposed appeal, the bona fides of the proposed appeal and the prima facie strength of the proposed grounds of appeal ( Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187; Howard v Australian Electoral Commission [2000] FCA 1767 at [7] ).</text>

<tocase>M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/16.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The applicant presented evidence from the Elder with respect to the specific issue of her attendance at church in Sydney (cf M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16 at [97] ; SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733 at [22] ). Unlike the evidence of the adviser, it was not evidence called by the Tribunal as part of its inquisitorial function (cf SAAP ).

24 In M164/2002 the Tribunal ' received information from the appellant's husband in the course of the hearing ' (at [97]). Justice Lee concluded that, if the Tribunal relied on alleged inconsistencies between that evidence and the evidence of the appellant, it was bound to set out in writing the perceived inconsistency between the information obtained at the hearing and the details provided by the appellant in her oral account and in the written accounts attached to the application for a visa, by reason of s 424A of the Act (at [99]). Justice Tamberlin agreed with the reasons of Lee J but did not comment further on this aspect. It is not clear to me that Lee J was saying that, where an applicant calls a witness to give oral evidence on her behalf, that is information outside the scope of s 424A(3)(b) any more than is a letter from a third person submitted by an applicant to the Tribunal in support of her application to the Tribunal. Justice Dowsett, who was in dissent, described at [186] what occurred as '[b] oth the appellant and her husband appear to have accepted that each was a relevant witness in establishing that case '. His Honour contrasted what occurred with information given "in evidence" by an applicant, to include all information put before the Tribunal by the applicant. An example of the latter was giving information to the Tribunal by calling a witness. Accordingly, I do not take Lee J as finding that evidence of a witness called by an applicant needs to be provided in writing to an applicant by reason of s 424A(1) of the Act. That information is evidence given by the applicant to the Tribunal within s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.</text>

<text>25 In VQAN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1541 Heerey J considered the consequences of a very long delay. In that case, the delay was three and a half years and the explanation was detailed but his Honour did not consider that a satisfactory explanation had been proffered. In discussing the consequences of that delay, his Honour referred to Re Commonwealth of Australia; ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491 where McHugh J observed at [16]:
 
 'Independently of the merits of the case, I find it difficult to see how a person who, with knowledge of the decision, delays 17 months before seeking relief could ever be granted an extension of time to quash such a decision unless some conduct of the respondent or the public body or official had brought about the delay.'

27 In VQAN , Heerey J concluded that even where there is no satisfactory explanation, the prospects of success of the appeal are relevant to the decision to grant an extension of time. His Honour noted that McHugh J had said in Marks at [13], with reference to his earlier judgment in Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479, that '[a] "case would need to be exceptional" before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months '.</text>

<text>21 It is strongly arguable that Ms Sit's evidence and the information in the protection visa application formed part of the reasons of the Tribunal in its rejection of the applicant's claims because it rejected her credibility. If so, there was a failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with s 424A(1) in respect of that information, such information not having been put to the applicant in writing. The fact that the evidence was given in the applicant's presence and that she was given the opportunity to comment on it and on the inconsistencies with her evidence to the Tribunal does not avoid the obligation to comply with s 424A(1) and (2) ( SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [110] ).
