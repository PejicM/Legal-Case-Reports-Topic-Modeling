<tocase>Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/137.html</AustLII>
<text>28 In support of that contention the applicant relied primarily upon the judgment of French J in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494. In that case, Mr Johnson, a citizen of New Zealand came to Australia in 1981 at the age of six. He eventually acquired a lengthy criminal record. On 19 December 2002 the Minister purported to cancel his "special category visa" under s 501(2) of the Act on the basis that it was reasonably suspected that he did not pass the "character test". Mr Johnson submitted that he held an "absorbed person visa" pursuant to s 34 , and not a "special category visa". He submitted that the decision of the Minister to cancel a non-existent visa was therefore affected by jurisdictional error.

29 French J accepted that contention. He held that the Minister's decision to purportedly cancel a visa not held by the applicant was a nullity.

31 French J then discussed more recent High Court authority. He referred to Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391, a case which concerned the extent of the naturalization and aliens power under s 51(xix) of the Constitution . Mr Taylor, who faced deportation on account of criminal conviction, was a non-citizen whose absorption into the Australian community was not in issue. He had come to Australia in 1966 as a child, and been educated and made his home in this country. However, he had not taken out Australian citizenship. The Minister had purportedly cancelled his "absorbed person visa" which Gaudron J suggested reflected a concession that he had been completely absorbed into the community prior to April 1984. That, of course, was one of the requisites for an "absorbed person visa".

35 It was in the light of these authorities that French J, in Johnson , identified (at [46]) the factors relevant to whether a person has been absorbed into the Australian community (and has therefore "ceased to be an immigrant") as including the following:
 
 
 "1. The time that has elapsed since the person's entry into Australia. 
 2. The existence and timing of the formation of an intention to settle permanently in Australia. 
 3. The number and duration of absences. 
 4. Family or other close personal ties in Australia. 
 5. The presence of family members in Australia or the commitment of family members to come to Australia the join the person. 
 6. Employment history. 
 7. Economic ties including property ownership. 
 8. Contribution to, and participation in, community activities. 
 9. Any criminal record."

36 French J noted that this list of factors was plainly not exhaustive. Rather, he said it illustrated "the multi-dimensional character" of the judgment involved. In his Honour's view, all the relevant factors, other than the time that had elapsed since the Johnson family's move to Australia, pointed strongly to the proposition that the family had become part of the Australian community as at 2 April 1984. Although Mr Johnson's criminal record was extensive, it only began in 1991. Accordingly, it had little or no bearing upon whether he had ceased to be an immigrant by April 1984.

37 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Moore, in the proceeding before me, that, in accordance with the authorities, his criminal record prior to 1984 was such that it precluded him from having been absorbed into the Australian community. As a result, he had not "ceased to be an immigrant" within the meaning of s 34(2)(b) of the Act , and therefore had not acquired an absorbed person visa. That in turn meant, using the reasoning of French J in Johnson, that the Minister had cancelled a non-existent visa. If that were so, s 501F(3) would have no application to this case because, as is implicit in the reasoning of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 230 ALR 370, that section can only be invoked in circumstances where a valid visa has been cancelled.</text>

<tocase>Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/51.html</AustLII>
<text>31 French J then discussed more recent High Court authority. He referred to Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391, a case which concerned the extent of the naturalization and aliens power under s 51(xix) of the Constitution . Mr Taylor, who faced deportation on account of criminal conviction, was a non-citizen whose absorption into the Australian community was not in issue. He had come to Australia in 1966 as a child, and been educated and made his home in this country. However, he had not taken out Australian citizenship. The Minister had purportedly cancelled his "absorbed person visa" which Gaudron J suggested reflected a concession that he had been completely absorbed into the community prior to April 1984. That, of course, was one of the requisites for an "absorbed person visa".

32 In Ex parte Taylor the High Court held, by a four to three majority, that Mr Taylor, as a British subject, was not an alien but a subject of the Queen of Australia. As such the power to cancel a visa under s 501(3) of the Act could not apply to him.

33 Ex parte Taylor was effectively overruled in Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 72 ; (2003) 218 CLR 28 in relation to the time from which British subjects entering Australia would remain as aliens for constitutional purposes notwithstanding their absorption into the community and the ending of their status as immigrants. As in Ex parte Taylor , the question of absorption was not an issue in Shaw .</text>

As in Ex parte Taylor , the question of absorption was not an issue in Shaw .

34 Importantly for present purposes, in Shaw Callinan J (at [183]) accepted that the commission of serious crimes against the community may be inconsistent with a person's absorption into the community. He referred to Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Te [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 212 CLR 162 in that regard. He noted, however, that Mr Shaw had been living in Australia for more than twelve years before his first conviction which occurred when he was still a child. His Honour concluded that, in those circumstances, Mr Shaw had been absorbed into the Australian community by the time he came to the notice of the criminal courts. He added that he would not regard that first conviction, occurring as it did when Mr Shaw was so young, as putting him beyond the community of ordinary Australians.</text>

<tocase>Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/568.html</AustLII>
<text>47 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Minister must have paid only lip service to the best interests of the child, otherwise she would not have come to the decision that she did. In support of that submission counsel referred to Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133. There the Full Court held that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had failed to treat the best interests of the children as a "primary consideration" in its determination.

48 In Wan , it was said to be of particular significance that the Tribunal had failed to identify anywhere in its written reasons for decision what the best interests of the children indicated that it should decide with respect to the application for a visa. It was also noted that the Tribunal had failed to describe the best interests of the children as a "primary consideration".

49 Neither of those factors is present in this case. The Minister plainly gave detailed attention to the best interests of the applicant's son, which she accepted favoured non-cancellation. She recognised that this was a primary consideration. She said she gave it "great weight".

50 Counsel for the applicant relied, in particular, upon the following extract from the Full Court's judgment in Wan (at [32]):
 
 "An identification by the Tribunal of what the best interests of Mr Wan's children required, and a recognition by the Tribunal of the need to treat such interests as a primary consideration, would not have led inexorably to a decision by the Tribunal to adopt a course in conformity with those interests. That is, even had the Tribunal concluded that the best interests of the children indicated that Mr Wan should be granted a visa, it was legally open to it to refuse to grant Mr Wan a visa. Provided that the Tribunal did not treat any other consideration as inherently more significant than the best interests of Mr Wan's children, it was entitled to conclude, after a proper consideration of the evidence and other material before it, that the strength of other considerations outweighed the best interests of the children. However, it was required to identify what the best interests of Mr Wan's children required with respect to the exercise of its discretion and then to assess whether the strength of any other consideration, or the cumulative effect of other considerations, outweighed the consideration of the best interests of the children understood as a primary consideration."

51 In my view, there is nothing in this passage which supports the applicant's claim. The balancing process described above accords precisely with the approach that the Minister herself adopted.

52 In truth, Ground 2, and the applicant's submissions in support of that ground, seek merely to have this Court engage in merits review. That the Court cannot do.</text>

<tocase>Sales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1807.html</AustLII>
<text>53 The applicant's argument in support of Ground 3 relied almost entirely upon the decision of Allsop J in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807. In that case his Honour set aside a decision by the Minister to cancel the applicant's visas, namely an absorbed person visa and a transitional (permanent) visa, because the applicant had been denied procedural fairness.

54 In Sales the applicant was given only 14 days to respond to a letter hand delivered to him on 8 August 2006 together with a copy of the Direction that set out, over some 11 pages, the matters that the Minister regarded as relevant to her determination. The letter also included a number of other documents, such as extracts from the Act , the applicant's criminal history, pre-release reports of various dates, parole reports and a copy of the sentencing judge's remarks.

55 Allsop J took into account the fact that the applicant in Sales was not a well-educated man. He also inferred that his family were not "people of wide or deep resources", or otherwise of significant education. His Honour said that it was clear that the task at hand for the applicant and those concerned with his welfare was likely to be a difficult one because of the seriousness of the crime for which he had served 18 years in prison, namely a particularly callous and brutal murder. To require him to put forward in a coherent fashion a response to the Department's letter in the space of 14 days was unrealistic and plainly inadequate.

56 However, the case of Mr Moore can, in no way, be equated with Sales . As previously indicated, Mr Moore was served with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his absorbed person visa no later than about 5 July 2006 (seven days after the date on which the letter was sent). He was told that any response must be received by 24 July 2006.

57 Had matters rested there, the applicant would have had reasonable grounds for complaint. Nineteen days is scarcely an improvement over the 14 days regarded as inadequate in Sales . However, on 11 July 2006 Victoria Legal Aid requested an extension of time within which to respond. On 18 July 2006 the Department granted an extension until 21 August 2006. Thus the applicant was given more than six weeks to provide a response to the Minister's notice, a period I regard as reasonable in the circumstances.

58 Indeed, the applicant's position was actually stronger than this. On 12 October 2006 the Department wrote to Victoria Legal Aid inviting comment on matters it considered relevant to the notice of intention to consider cancellation. On 24 October 2006, Victoria Legal Aid responded to that letter. There was nothing to suggest that the applicant could not have added anything further to his earlier submission, in support of his claim to be permitted to retain his absorbed person visa. In fact the Department's letter of 12 October 2006 stated, after inviting the applicant to address the matters specifically drawn to his attention for comment, that he:
 
 " ... may also wish to provide other information that he considers should be taken into account when a decision is made whether to cancel his visa."

59 In my view, the applicant was given ample opportunity to respond to the notice. He was not denied procedural fairness. Accordingly, Ground 3 is not made out.</text>
