<text>An extension of time may be granted where an applicant can establish " special reasons ": Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) O 52 r 15(2). The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties: WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] ; Applicant S1138 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1052 at [11] ; SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [10] .

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/195.html</AustLII>
<text>In the exercise of this discretion, some Judges have embraced the proposition that "... in the case of asylum seekers, this court will be circumspect about being too rigorous in applying the normal principles of judicial review in relation to delay because the court appreciates that to refuse an application for [permission] to apply for judicial review solely on the grounds of delay may have very grave consequences for the asylum seeker ": R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Ahmad [1999] Imm AR 356 at 357 per Lord Woolf MR. These observations have been applied by Finkelstein J in Applicants M160/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 195 at [5] , [2005] FCA 195 ; 85 ALD 532 at 535. And in some circumstances, the Full Court has observed that in refugee cases leave to appeal out of time will " ordinarily " be granted: N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 403, 68 ALD 21. Lee, Moore and Madgwick JJ there observed: 
 [12] In the present case although the delay involved is a period of two months, it is to be borne in mind that leave is sought by a person: who is an applicant for refugee status; who does not understand English; who is not familiar with the legal system of this country; and, who, at all material times, has been interned in a detention centre without legal representation. It may be concluded, therefore that in those circumstances "special reasons" have been demonstrated and given that the Minister will not be prejudiced if leave is granted, leave to appeal out of time, ordinarily, would be granted. 

 
Reservation may be expressed as to whether refugee cases fall into any special or separate category of case or whether the gravity or consequences of refusing an extension of time must be taken into account in all cases. In those cases where applicants are bona fide seeking asylum, it may well be that the gravity of the circumstances they confront may be a very real reason for granting the extension sought. The observations of the Full Court, it is considered, should not be understood as denying the discretion conferred by O 52 r 15(2) or indicating that any particular exercise of discretion should proceed otherwise than upon the basis of all of the relevant facts presented in any individual application. Those observations of the Full Court must also be understood to have been made in the context where there was an explanation for the entirety of the period for which the extension was there sought and where that extension was for a period far shorter than in the present proceeding.

Relevant to the ultimate conclusion reached by the Federal Magistrate was the conclusion that the Refugee Review Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error. Even if the discretion were to be exercised afresh by this Court, that conclusion would remain equally relevant. It is proper when exercising the discretion to have regard to the merits of the substantive application sought to be advanced: Applicants M160/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 195 at [14] , [2005] FCA 195 ; 85 ALD 532 at 538 per Finkelstein J.</text>

<tocase>Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 , 117 FCR 424</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1833.html</AustLII>
<text>If an extension of time within which to appeal to this Court were granted, the appeal pursuant to s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) would be by way of rehearing: Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 , 117 FCR 424. And, on appeal, the Court would have a discretion to admit further evidence pursuant to s 27 of the 1976 Act.

It is, however, unlikely that the discretion conferred by s 27 would be exercised in favour of the now Applicant to so fundamentally revisit the evidence previously given.

The fact remains that there was inordinate delay as between the date of the Tribunal decision in 2001 and the application for review by the Federal Magistrates Court in 2007. Either for the reasons given by the Federal Magistrate, or by reference to the account now advanced, any decision that the application should be rejected for discretionary reasons remains, it is considered, the correct decision.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>But the reservation, it must be accepted, is of importance. The Federal Magistrate acted upon a concession made by the Applicant that he had received a copy of the Tribunal's decision " two to three months after the date which had been scheduled for the Tribunal's hearing (1 March 2001) ". But " the Tribunal's decision was sent to the applicant under cover of a letter dated 26 July 2001 ". The difficulty of conceding receipt of a letter before it was sent is apparent. A fundamental mistake as to the facts may bring an applicant within House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ.

But the reservation, it is considered, should not prevail.

The Federal Magistrate had the benefit of the Applicant giving oral evidence and his conclusions were conclusions based upon the entirety of the evidence, including his assessment as to the Applicant's credibility. It may also be queried whether the finding of the Federal Magistrate as to when the Applicant became aware of the Tribunal's decision does indeed expose error. The words employed by the Magistrate suggest error &#8212; but the contradictory findings are made within the one paragraph of his reasons. It is most likely that the error simply exposes an error in transcription rather than such a fundamental misunderstanding as to the facts as now sought to be attributed to him by the Applicant.</text>

<text>Of relevance to the exercise of the discretion, but never conclusive, is the fact that many applicants seeking to challenge adverse decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) are not fluent in English and frequently are not represented by legal advisers: cf Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 1511.

Notwithstanding the calling of further oral evidence, there remains an absence of any real explanation for the whole of the delay. Any discretion, it is considered, should be exercised against the Applicant. Any explanation which is put forward as an explanation for delay must set forth an explanation for the entirety of the delay; an explanation for only part of the delay may normally be regarded as insufficient: QAAH v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZKSM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 632 at [20] ; SZGND v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 680 at [22] .

<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 , 204 CLR 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/57.html</AustLII>
<text>In respect to the exercise of discretion, the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate were in part as follows: 
 Delay 

 
 [19] The first respondent submits that, regardless of whether jurisdictional error is demonstrated, the relief sought by the applicant should be denied in the exercise of the Court's discretion because he took unduly long to commence these proceedings. In this regard, it should be noted that the Tribunal's decision was sent to the applicant under cover of a letter dated 26 July 2001 and these proceedings were not commenced until 22 June 2007. In his evidence to the Court the applicant conceded that he had received the Tribunal's decision two to three months after the date which had been scheduled for the Tribunal's hearing (1 March 2001). The applicant also agreed that he had received the decision and its covering letter from the Tribunal. He said that he did read the covering letter but not fully, did not fully understand it and was upset and puzzled. He said that he did not discuss the letter with his agent even though the agent had rung him to say that he too had received a copy of the letter advising of the Tribunal's decision. The applicant said that he did not ask his agent what to do next in relation to his visa status.
 
 ... 

 
 [24] It is clear that the Court does have a discretion to deny relief in circumstances where the conduct of the applicant is inconsistent with the application for relief, including where the applicant has been guilty of unwarrantable delay: SAAP v Minister for Immigration Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 1009 per McHugh J at 1026 [80]; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at 197 [28] . This is not a case where the applicant's delay in bringing proceedings is measured in months. It is a delay which is measured in years. The explanation advanced by the applicant for his delay in bringing the proceedings is not credible and I reject it. In his evidence the applicant said that it was through hard work and trying to find information and encouragement from a friend that he became aware of his right to appeal. No explanation was advanced as to why this process matured into an application to this Court only in 2007. Moreover, such evidence is not consistent with the applicant's knowledge that he was denied his hearing before the Tribunal. He knew that he had been invited to appear but had, in fact, been denied the opportunity of so doing. 

 
 [25] Knowing that he had been denied his hearing and that his application to the Tribunal had been unsuccessful, the applicant should have made enquiries at an early date with a view to enforcing his rights and vindicating his claim to be a refugee. The fact that he did not do so requires an explanation more compelling than that he did not know that he had a right of appeal. 

 
 [26] But in any event, I have found that he was aware as early as 2001 that if he wished the Tribunal's decision to be set aside he would need to seek judicial review in the Federal Court. He has put nothing before the Court to explain why he did not act on this knowledge. 

 
 [27] The applicant having given no adequate explanation for the very considerable delay in bringing these proceedings, relief will be denied in the exercise of the Court's discretion.

In support of the present Application for an extension of time, two Affidavits were filed. The first was sworn on 12 December 2008 and the second was sworn on 29 January 2009. The Affidavit upon which reliance was ultimately placed at the hearing was one sworn by the Applicant on 4 February 2009. The Respondent relied upon an Affidavit of the instructing solicitor sworn on 6 February 2009. Objection was taken to both Affidavits &#8212; but both were admitted subject to the objections taken as to relevance.

At the outset of the hearing on 6 February 2009, the deficiency in the factual account as set forth in the February Affidavit was explored with Counsel for the Applicant &#8212; that deficiency being that it really set forth no explanation for the entirety of the delay as between January and December 2008. The opportunity was extended to the Applicant to adjourn the proceeding and to file further affidavit evidence and evidence in admissible form. The course ultimately embraced by Counsel for the Applicant, however, was to lead on that date further oral evidence from the Applicant. The Applicant was cross-examined.

But for the Applicant's delay in invoking his rights, he would in all likelihood have obtained relief: R v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185. Gibbs CJ there observed (at 194) in respect to relief in the nature of prohibition: 
 If therefore, a clear case of want or excess of jurisdiction has been made out, and the prosecutor is a party aggrieved, the writ will issue almost as of right, although the court retains its discretion to refuse relief if in all the circumstances that seems the proper course. 

 
This has been accepted by Gaudron and Gummow JJ as " the correct approach to the exercise of the original jurisdiction in matters in which a writ of prohibition is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth under s 75(v) of the Constitution ": Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 at [51] , 204 CLR 82 at 106.</text>

<text>Of relevance to the exercise of the discretion, but never conclusive, is the fact that many applicants seeking to challenge adverse decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) are not fluent in English and frequently are not represented by legal advisers: cf Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 1511. And when represented by (for example) counsel appearing on a pro bono basis, the Court is considerably benefited: SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [13] to [14]. Also of relevance, but again not conclusive, may be the financial circumstances confronting an applicant: cf QAAH v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZKDC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 164 at [12] .</text>

<text>An extension of time may be granted where an applicant can establish " special reasons ": Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) O 52 r 15(2). The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties: WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] ; Applicant S1138 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1052 at [11] ; SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [10] . An applicant, it has been said, must advance a reason to take " the case out of the ordinary ": Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195. The rule confers " a flexible discretionary power ": (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195. Even where " special reasons " can be established, the Court thus retains a discretion to grant or refuse the extension sought: Kordatos v Sweeney [2004] FCA 1487 at [17] per Cooper J. So much is apparent from the terms of r 15(2) itself "... the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time... ".</text>
