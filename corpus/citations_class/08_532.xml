<tocase>Hanlon v The Law Society [1981] AC 124</tocase>
<text>12 The principles that govern the use of regulations in construing the statute under which they are made were stated by Lord Lowry in Hanlon v The Law Society [1981] AC 124 at 193-194 as follows:
 (1) Subordinate legislation may be used in order to construe the parent Act, but only where power is given to amend the Act by regulations or where the meaning of the Act is ambiguous. (2) Regulations made under the Act provide a Parliamentary or administrative contemporanea expositio of the Act but do not decide or control its meaning: to allow this would be to substitute the rule-making authority for the judges as interpreter and would disregard the possibility that the regulation relied on was misconceived or ultra vires. (3) Regulations which are consistent with a certain interpretation of the Act tend to confirm that interpretation. (4) Where the Act provides a framework built on by contemporaneously prepared regulations, the latter may be a reliable guide to the meaning of the former. (5) The regulations are a clear guide, and may be decisive, when they are made in pursuance of a power to modify the Act, particularly if they come into operation on the same day as the Act which they modify. (6) Clear guidance may also be obtained from regulations which are to have effect as if enacted in the parent Act. 
Number (4) is applicable to the present case.</text>

<tocase>Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1951/42.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The respondents relied on Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402. In that case the High Court held (at 410) that reg 188 of the Excise Regulations 1925 (Cth) were ultra vires the Excise Act 1901 (Cth) and void because regulations cannot 
 vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or... go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself. 
The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed "a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided" (at 412).

18 In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg 2.14 was ultra vires and therefore void.

19 The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations. On the contrary, the scheme of both Old Act and New Act is to leave to the regulations questions of who may enforce.</text>

<tocase>Rodway v The Queen [1990] HCA 19 ; (1990) 169 CLR 515</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/19.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The respondents' alternative argument is that reg 2.14 only operates prospectively. They say that at the time the alleged contraventions took place they had a "right" not to be vexed by litigation by anyone other than a party to an AWA. Citing Rodway v The Queen [1990] HCA 19 ; (1990) 169 CLR 515 at 519, they contended that they had a "right to be free of a claim". They rely also on s 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act .

21 The expression quoted from Rodway appears in a context where their Honours are discussing limitation statutes and whether they should be given a retrospective operation to revive a cause of action which has become barred, or deprive a person of the opportunity of instituting an action which is within time. In such cases, giving the legislation a retrospective operation 
 would operate so as to impair existing, substantive rights either the right to be free of a claim or the right to bring a claim and such an operation could not be said to be merely procedural. (Emphasis added.)

22 The actual decision in Rodway does not assist the respondents indeed to the contrary. Until its repeal on 26 November 1987, s 136(1) of the Criminal Code (Tas) required corroboration for conviction of certain offences. Before the date of repeal the appellant was charged with such an offence. He was committed for trial in 1988 and his trial commenced in 1989. The High Court (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) unanimously held that the Code in its post-amendment form applied. Their Honours said at 521:
 ... ordinarily an amendment to the practice or procedure of a court, including the admissibility of evidence and the effect to be given to evidence, will not operate retrospectively so as to impair any existing right. It may govern the way in which the right is to be enforced or vindicated, but that does not bring it within the presumption against retrospectivity. A person who commits a crime does not have a right to be tried in any particular way; merely a right to be tried according to the practice and procedure prevailing at the time of trial. 

In the present case the respondents in September December 2005 either did or did not apply duress in relation to AWAs. If they did, they incurred a substantive obligation, the liability to such penalty as might be fixed by a court. They did not acquire any substantive right to have that obligation ascertained in some particular way, or only at the suit of some particular person or class of persons, any more than they acquired the right to be tried only by the law of evidence as it stood in December 2005.

23 For the same reason, the respondents acquired no "rights" in terms of the Legislative Instruments Act .

24 In any event, the presumption against retrospectivity is no more than that, a presumption which must yield to a clear expression of intent to the contrary. An issue of retrospectivity raises the question whether a law which on its face applies equally to past and future events must be read down as to apply only to the latter. In its terms reg 2.14 is solely concerned with involvement in proceedings for alleged contraventions under the Old Act. Such contraventions can only have happened before reg 2.14 came into operation. The whole purpose of reg 2.14 is to deal with past events.</text>

<tocase>Thorn EMI Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 491</tocase>
<text>13 In Thorn EMI Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 491 at 498 Beaumont J, in the context of the sales tax legislative scheme, said:
 It may be accepted, as a general proposition, that "the intention of Parliament in enacting an Act is not to be ascertained by reference to the terms in which a delegated power to legislate has been exercised" (per Brennan J in Webster v McIntosh (1980) 49 FLR 317 at 321.) On the other hand, as Mason J observed in the course of argument in Brayson Motors Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1985] HCA 20 ; (1985) 156 CLR 651 at 652: 
 
 One looks at regulations, not to construe an overall scheme or to throw light on ambiguity in a statutory provision, but to ascertain what the scheme is.
 
 
In the present context, it has been settled since the decision in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (SA) v Ellis &amp; Clark Ltd [1934] HCA 54 ; (1934) 52 CLR 85 , that the Sales Tax Regulations are an essential part of the legislative scheme (see, especially, per Dixon J at 89). This approach was affirmed recently in Brayson Motors (supra, at 657) and it is unnecessary to pursue the questions which could arise in other contexts (cf Neill v Glacier Metal Co Ltd [1965] 1 QB 16 at 27; Jackson v Hall [1980] AC 854 at 884, 889; Bennion, opcit, at p 146). In my opinion, reference to the Sales Tax Regulations, including reg 14A(2), is not merely permissible; it is essential to an understanding of the legislative plan.</text>
