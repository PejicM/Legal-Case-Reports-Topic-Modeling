<text>28 In recent times applications to restrain solicitors from acting against clients or former clients have arisen not infrequently and have been the subject of detailed consideration in Australian courts, in particular in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 (Victorian Court of Appeal), Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 (Ryan J), Photocure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2002) 56 IPR 86 (Goldberg J) and Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 (Young J). The leading English authority is the House of Lords' decision in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222.</text>

<text>28 In recent times applications to restrain solicitors from acting against clients or former clients have arisen not infrequently and have been the subject of detailed consideration in Australian courts, in particular in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 (Victorian Court of Appeal), Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 (Ryan J), Photocure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2002) 56 IPR 86 (Goldberg J) and Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 (Young J). The leading English authority is the House of Lords' decision in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222.

32 However, the critical question is whether the knowledge of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert should be imputed to other lawyers at BDW. In Red Earth at [34] Ryan J said:
 
 "It is now well established that the knowledge of a solicitor joining a new firm should not automatically be imputed or attributed to other lawyers or employees at that firm (see Re a Firm of Solicitors [1992] QB 959 at 973, per Staughton LJ; Unioil International Pty Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (1997) 17 WAR 98, per Ipp J at 110-111; Newman v Phillips Fox (1999) 21 WAR 309, per Steytler J; Bolkiah (supra) at 235). As Lord Millett said in Bolkiah , whether a particular individual is in possession of confidential information is a question of fact to be proved or inferred from the circumstances of the case: ( Bolkiah at 235. See also the observation of Steytler J in Newman v Phillips Fox (supra) at 317).

33 Applying that principle, and assuming the onus is on BDW, I am satisfied that no relevant information was passed on to anyone at BDW. The detailed evidence both from Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert and from solicitors at BDW, the veracity of which was not challenged, enables that conclusion to be safely drawn. The circumstances point the same way. A large and reputable firm like BDW would be aware of the obvious potential conflict when a solicitor previously acting on the other side of litigation has joined them. This would be clear, notwithstanding that Corrs had ceased acting for Arkaroola some six months earlier. So there was all the more reason to take positive steps, such as notifying the former client of Mr Lindwall and going out of their way to ensure that he had nothing to do with any matters relating to that client.

34 As events have turned out, Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert left BDW before the present Federal Court litigation commenced so the risk of even accidental communication of relevant information hereafter can be ignored.</text>

<text>31 I will assume for present purposes that Mr Salfinger has made out a case with sufficient particularity that confidential information concerning his affairs and those of Arkaroola passed into the possession of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert when they were at Corrs. Such confidential information would extend to what Gillard J in Yunghanns v Elfic Ltd (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported, 3 July 1998) has characterised as the "getting to know you" factors. His Honour said at 10-11:
 
 "In some cases the circumstances of the retainer and the nature of the legal work will be sufficient to establish the nature of the confidential information. In this regard the relationship between solicitor and client may be such that the solicitor learns a great deal about his client, his strengths, his weaknesses, his honesty or lack thereof, his reaction to crisis, pressure or tension, his attitude to litigation and settling cases and his tactics. These are factors which I would call the 'getting to know you' factors. The overall opinion formed by a solicitor of his client as a result of his contact may in the circumstances amount to confidential information that should not be disclosed or used against the client."
