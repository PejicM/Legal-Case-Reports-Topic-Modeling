<text>36 Reference may also be made to the observations, to the same effect, by Gyles J in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at [68] . See also the review of the authorities by Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Limited v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; and Lombe v Pollak [2004] FCA 264 at [30] [33] dealing with the common law test.

46 The tender of Exhibit JL1 cannot be said to have been to deploy the substance of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes so as to reveal an implied inconsistency with the maintenance of confidentiality; Bennett at [68].

47 I accept Mr Johnson's submission that it is extraordinary that both solicitors and counsel for Mr Boensch failed to make any or any adequate enquiry as to the extent of the materials contained in Exhibit JL1. Some criticism may flow from that. But it does not preclude a finding of inadvertence.

48 I do not accept Mr Johnson's submission that the documents in Exhibit JL1 were delivered without qualification as to their status. The qualification was stated in [50] of the statement to which the Exhibit was attached. Although no evidence was put before his Honour to explain the mistake, the circumstances make it plain that error and inadvertence were revealed.

49 I will make orders 1, 3 and 4 sought in the notice of appeal filed on 13 February 2007.

 I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

<tocase>Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 9 NSWLR 538</tocase>
<text>39 Of course, "a mere plea" of inadvertence may not by itself necessarily enable a party to avoid a waiver of privilege; Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 9 NSWLR 538 at 542-543. Thus, the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent.

40 In the present case, inadvertence is established by the fact that even when cross-examined on the documents, Mr Leong did not realise that the documents in Exhibit 
JL1 included the Extra Documents.

41 It was only when Mr Heath realised what had happened that he drew his Honour's attention to the apparent inadvertence. This is clear, in my view from the passages of the transcript that I have reproduced above.

42 It is true that in the last passage of the transcript that I have reproduced at [27], Mr Heath said that no issue of inadvertence arose. However, this was because, as Mr Heath correctly observed, the amended application before his Honour dealt only with the question of whether privilege could be maintained over Exhibit SDP6.

43 With due respect to his Honour, whose judgment was given ex tempore , an examination of the transcript shows that Mr Heath did not eschew inadvertence in relation to the maintenance of the claim over the Extra Documents.

44 Of course, I do not criticise his Honour for delivering ex tempore reasons. It is merely that a full reading of the transcript puts in context the last passage of Counsel's remarks on the issue of inadvertence.

45 In any event, I would add that it is difficult to see how the tender of Exhibit JL1 was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. It was tendered on an application to claim privilege and it was tendered with the express proviso in [50] of Mr Leong's statement that he did not intend to disclose confidential communications to which privilege may attach.</text>

<tocase>Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/66.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The appellant, Mr Boensch, contends that his Honour was in error in concluding that the tender was deliberate and that any claim of inadvertence had been eschewed. Mr Boensch submits that, upon the proper application of the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13, there was no implied or accidental waiver of privilege in the six documents.

4 The essential reason why this issue arises is the failure of the solicitor who produced the documents to the first respondent, Mr Pascoe, and to the Court, to make proper enquiry as to the extent of the materials comprised within the documents that were produced and tendered.

5 In the hope of maintaining clarity in my analysis of the question, I will endeavour to distinguish between the documents produced or referred to at various stages of the proceeding.

34 The test of implied waiver of privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [29]. Their Honours pointed to an intentional act of disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication.

35 Their Honours went on to say that "[w]hat brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of confidentiality". They said the test is "not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large".

37 It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).</text>
