<tocase>Fearnley v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FCAFC 3</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/3.html</AustLII>
<text>8 The Member cited a decision of a Full Court of this Court in Fearnley v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FCAFC 3. This case also involved an application for review of a decision which had had an effect for a limited period of time which had long since expired. What was in issue was a quota of shark allocated to a fisherman in relation to the 2001 fishing season from 1 January to 31 December 2001. By contract made on 17 December 2001, the fisherman had sold the quota and transferred to the purchasers the fishing permits to which the quota was attached. In that case the Tribunal observed that the proceeding before it would lead to "no practical outcome for" the applicant, and was "futile" and "must be regarded as frivolous and vexatious". That decision was upheld by the Full Court.

9 In his notice of appeal to this Court the applicant states that "the questions of law raised on the appeal are":
 
 
 "(a) That the Tribunal erred in finding that the Applicant had available to him the avenue of complaint to the Ombudsman. 
 
 (b) That the Tribunal erred in finding that the basis of the applicant's application for review was to give comfort to those who are disaffected by a decision, in circumstances where no orders can be made which can change what has occurred when such finding was inconsistent with the orders that the applicant was seeking in the Tribunal. 
 
 (c) That the Tribunal erred in finding that the domestic issues underlying the applicant's concerns had now been resolved."

10 The Tribunal did not make a "finding" that the applicant had available to him an avenue of complaint to the Ombudsman (ground (a)), but merely noted that the solicitor of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, who represented the applicant's wife, indicated that in his view the applicant still had available to him that avenue of complaint.</text>
