<tocase>Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/907.html</AustLII>
<text>13 On 6 July 1999 Sackville J in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 made the following orders pursuant to Order 21, r 1 of the Federal Court Rules :
 
 
 1. The respondent's motion to strike out the proceedings (that is, the application for an order contemplated by O 21 r 1) be dismissed; 
 
 2. The respondent shall not institute any proceedings in this court without the leave of the court; 
 
 3. Any proceedings currently instituted in this court by the respondent shall not be continued by the respondent without the leave of the court; 
 
 4. The respondent pay the applicant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings.'

14 His Honour at p 380 [2] made these observations: 
 
 The applicant claims that the respondent is a "vexatious litigant", within the meaning of FCR O 21, r 1. The applicant relies on the fact that the respondent has instituted a large number of proceedings in this Court, each of which (according to the applicant) was commenced without reasonable grounds. The applicant says that in each proceeding the respondent, in one form or another, has sought, unsuccessfully, to challenge the legality of paper currency or coinage in use in Australia. Specifically, it is said that the respondent has "habitually and persistently" (to use the language of O 21, r 1) asserted that s 115 and other provisions of the Constitution prohibit the creation of legal tender in forms other than coins containing gold or silver, and that the provisions of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) (Reserve Bank Act) and the Currency Act 1965 (Cth) (Currency Act) establishing or recognising paper money or coinage as legal tender are invalid. According to the applicant, these contentions have been conclusively and repeatedly rejected by the High Court, the Supreme Court of Queensland and this Court. In these circumstances, the applicant contends that the terms of O 21, r 1 have been satisfied and that the orders sought in the application should be made.'

<tocase>Re Skyring's Application (No. 2) (1985) 59 ALJR 561; Re Skyring (1985) 58 ALR 629</tocase>
<text>18 In December 1984, Mr Skyring lodged with the Brisbane registry of the High Court six documents conveniently described as 'writs' five of which were directed to a different Commonwealth Government Minister and the sixth to a 'judge of the Federal Court' (Spender J) by which Mr Skyring sought to initiate proceedings to agitate 'a general attack upon the financial system' ( Re Skyring's Application (No. 2) (1985) 59 ALJR 561; Re Skyring (1985) 58 ALR 629 at p 631 per Deane J). In Mr Skyring's affidavit in support of an application for leave to issue those writs, Mr Skyring noted that the argument to be advanced in the proposed actions was in terms of 'the key items presented in my argument before McPherson J when my tax case was eventually heard on 19 August 1983 in the Queensland Supreme Court' and 'this present action is intended to initiate further corrective action to bring about appropriate amendments to legislation relating to the financial institutions themselves'.

19 His Honour, Justice Deane at p 633, made these observations:
 
 The overall attack remains one upon the Australian financial system and to some extent the Australian legal system. The objective of the attack is to obtain a general review and reform of the law of those areas. There are, however, two particular matters which emerge in the course of Mr Skyring's oral submissions to which I should make specific reference. These are: 
 
 
 
 (1) A submission that the combined effect of a number of sections of the Constitution is to erect a barrier against the issue by the Commonwealth of paper money as legal tender. The sections of the Constitution upon which particular reliance is placed are ss 51 (xii),(xiii) and (xvi) and 115 . Mr Skyring also referred to ss 105 and 105A . Additionally, reference was made to the provisions of the Currency Act 1965 (Cth) dealing with coins. The argument, if accepted, would result in the invalidity of s 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) which provides that 'Australian notes are a legal tender throughout Australia'. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The basis upon which Mr Skyring seeks relief against 'the judge of the Federal Court' is alleged error by Spender J of the Federal Court of Australia in proceedings in the Federal Court by Mr Skyring against the Commissioner of Patents and Telecom Australia. As I followed Mr Skyring's oral submissions, the error into which Spender J is to have fallen is a failure to accept the argument referred to in (1) above. It is to be noted that the time for appealing from the judgment has expired. Mr Skyring frankly stated that one of the reasons for seeking to proceed by certiorari was that the time for appeal had expired. He was, however, at pains to stress that the matters which he wished to litigate went beyond the matters could be properly raised on such an appeal. 
 
 
 
 I have come to a clear conclusion that there is no substance in the argument that there is a constitutional bar against the issue by the Commonwealth of paper money as legal tender. Nor, in my view, would there by any substance in an argument that the provisions of s 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 are invalidated or overruled by the provisions of the Currency Act 1965 . That being so, I am unpersuaded that there is any substance in the proposed proceedings against Mr Justice Spender, nor am I persuaded that the proceedings by certiorari against Mr Justice Spender would in any event be appropriate. Leave to issue the writs must be refused.

20 On 9 July 1985, their Honours Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ dismissed an appeal from the orders of Deane J noting that 'in this appeal from Mr Justice Deane's decision the appellant claims that the writs were designed to establish a decision by the Court that the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution do not authorise the issue of paper money as legal tender, that s 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) which so provides is invalid and that taxation is an infringement of property rights deriving from Magna Carta and therefore the Income Tax Assessment Act , in making provision for taxation, is invalid and unconstitutional'. The judgment is unreported although, of course, published by the Court.

21 In dismissing the appeal, their Honours said 'we are not persuaded that the judgment of Mr Justice Deane contains any error. We should say in addition that s 51(ii) confers power upon the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate with respect to taxation, that the exercise of that power extends to the imposition of taxation and its collection, even though it has the effect of requiring the person on whom taxation is levied to pay the tax out of property which he owns'.

23 In Re Skyring (1994) 68 ALJR 618, Dawson J considered an application by Mr Skyring for an order that leave be granted pursuant to Order 63, r 6 of the High Court Rules to commence proceedings for prerogative relief in relation to a number of matters and in all those proposed matters the argument Mr Skyring sought to agitate: 
 
 '... relied upon the proposition that it is beyond the power of the Commonwealth parliament to legislate to make paper money legal tender. This in essence is the same argument as that put by the applicant in Re Skyring's Application [No. 2] (1985) 59 ALJR 561, which was rejected by Deane J. His judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Full Court. ... The matter was concluded, in the view of the Court, by s 51(xii) and (xiii) of the Constitution and s 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth). It would, in my view, be an abuse of process to allow the applicant to re-litigate a matter which has already been decided adversely to him'. (Mason J at pp 618 and 619).

26 Assuming for the moment that a power to re-open an entered and therefore perfected order of the Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court by the provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), leave to file a motion (referable to the Full Court) to re-open the judgment must be refused for the following reasons. The issues relevant to the questions properly raised on appeal by Mr Skyring have been determined according to law. The order was made on 18 April 1984 and entered on 11 May 1984, over 23 years ago. The application made before the High Court by motion was not progressed. In my view, the arguments Mr Skyring makes and seeks to further agitate on the various grounds which I have described as his 'underlying contentions' including his proposition that s 36(2) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) is also invalid, are unarguable. Justices of the High Court have considered the essential integers of these contentions in various contexts with the result that the arguments have been found, to the extent of that examination, to be of no substance. Although a question of the fate of the monies paid by Mr Skyring by way of security in this appeal remains outstanding (as does the question of the reserved costs of that application) that question is not a vehicle for agitating the merits of the underlying contentions. Although Mr Skyring quite properly has a clear interest in the resolution of the two outstanding matters, the appeal proceeding (and matters relevant or irrelevant to the grounds of appeal argued by Mr Skyring before Smithers, Northrop and Beaumont JJ) is otherwise dispositively concluded in a way not shown to attract 'exceptional circumstances' supporting an exercise of a power to disturb a perfected order of the Full Court and re-open such an order and allow argument on the merits of any particular proposition including the underlying contentions. Most recently, Mr Skyring sought leave before the Federal Court to apply for annulment of his bankruptcy and removal of his trustee. Mr Skyring contended that the bankruptcy is unlawful and the argument as to unlawfulness rested upon a challenge to the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) authorising the issue of bank notes as legal tender. In dismissing both motions on 16 June 2004, Dowsett J said this:
 
 He [Mr Skyring] argues that that placitum 51(xiii) of the Constitution which authorises the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws concerning banking and the issue of paper money, does not authorise the issue of bank notes as lawful tender. It is difficult to see how such an argument can be maintained. It implies that the words 'paper money' means something quite different from their natural meaning. In any event, the issue was considered by Deane J in Re Skyring's Application (No. 2) (1985) 59 ALJR 561. His Honour concluded that there was no substance in the point although it is true, as Mr Skyring has pointed out that his Honour did not give reasons. In my view, the matter is beyond argument.

<tocase>Skyring v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1992) ATR 84</tocase>
<text>22 In Skyring v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1992) ATR 84, the Full Court of the Federal Court (Gummow, Einfeld and Heerey JJ) heard an appeal by Mr Skyring from a decision of Pincus J dismissing Mr Skyring's application in October 1990 for annulment of his bankruptcy. In that application and on appeal, Mr Skyring again agitated his contention that by s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth), the Commonwealth has made notes rather than gold and silver coin legal tender in payment of debts throughout Australia in contravention of s 115 of the Constitution . Mr Skyring also contended that the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to currency, coinage and legal tender contain words of limitation which render it not possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to enact a valid law for the issue and circulation of paper money and the rendering of paper money legal tender in the payment of debts, as legal tender must consist of coins of gold and silver value not simply paper of face value. Their Honours at p 87 said this:
 
 ... However, the expression does not contain any such words of limitation: R v Foster; Ex parte Eastern and Australian Steamship Co. Ltd [1959] HCA 10 ; (1959) 103 CLR 256 at 307; Union Steamship Co. of Australia Pty Ltd v King [1988] HCA 55 ; (1988) 166 CLR 1 at 10; 82 ALR 43. The parliament has legislated for the issue of paper money as legal tender and there is no constitutional bar against it having done so.

24 Section 51(xii) confers power upon the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to 'currency, coinage and legal tender' and by s 51(xiii), laws with respect to '... the issue of paper money'. The Australian Notes Act 1910 (Cth), Part VII of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911 (Cth), Part VI of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 (Cth) and Part V of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth) provide for the issue, re-issue and cancellation of 'Australian notes'. Section 34 of the Reserve Bank Act provides for the printing by or under the authority of the Reserve Bank of such notes. Section 35 provides for denominations of notes and s 36(1) provides that 'Australian notes are a legal tender throughout Australia'. Section 36(2) provides for a conversion of a note in a denomination of shillings or pounds to a denomination in decimal currency (for example, 10 shillings is a denomination of one dollar; one pound is a denomination of two dollars). Section 16 of the Currency Act 1965 (Cth) provides that tender of payment of money is a legal tender if made in coins made and issued under the Currency Act and the coins are of 'current weight' as defined. A tender of payment by coins is however legal tender subject to particular limitations (for example, if the tender is made up of coins that have a denomination of five cents, 10 cents, 20 cents or 50 cents or coins of two or more of those denominations, the tender will be a 'legal tender' for payment of an amount not exceeding five dollars. In the case of coins of a denomination greater than fifty cents but less than ten dollars, the limit is 10 times the face value of a coin of the denomination concerned). 'Currency' means the acceptance, reception, passing or circulation from hand to hand, from person to person, of metallic money or of government or bank notes as substitute for metallic money. 'Coinage' is the act or process of converting metal into money for circulation. The 'coining and legitimation of money' was one of the exclusive prerogatives of the Crown yet regulated by Act of Parliament from the 'earliest times'. 'Legal tender' is the act of tendering, in the performance of a contract, or in the satisfaction of a claim, that which the law prescribes or permits and at such time and place as the law prescribes or permits. As to these terms, see Quick and Garran , The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth , (1901) pp 572-6. The provisions of the Reserve Bank Act and the Currency Act are both properly characterised as a law with respect to an enumerated head of power within s 51 of the Constitution . The power to make laws with respect to those heads of power is to be given full expression and is not subject to the limitation Mr Skyring contends for ( Skyring v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (supra)). The contention that the provisions of the particular statutes are constitutionally invalid is, in my view, unarguable.

25 Mr Skyring says that he seeks to re-open the final order of the Full Court as there are the two outstanding matters to be addressed and accordingly the appeal proceeding remains on foot and is not 'finalised'; Mr Skyring was not able to progress an appeal before the High Court to test the merits in the appeal of his constitutional contentions; his underlying arguments as to constitutionality have therefore never been addressed; the outstanding costs order, its enforcement and the final resolution of the disposition of the monies paid by way of security entitles him to expose further his principal contentions; he has suffered and continues to suffer prejudice; and, 'exceptional circumstances' subsist which warrant re-opening the Full Court's order to enable the constitutional points to be argued. Those circumstances are said to be the prejudice suffered by Mr Skyring, the injustice thus arising and the broader public interest in determining the validity of his contentions.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1972/34.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The Federal Court of Australia is created by s 5 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and the Court is 'a superior court of record and is a court of law and equity'. Those words of extension 'and a court of law and equity' are not part of the formulation seen in s 21(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of the Family Court or in s 98 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) concerning the Commonwealth Industrial Court, considered in R v Forbes ; Ex parte Bevan [1972] HCA 34 ; (1972) 127 CLR 1. The Court is not a court of what might be described as essentially a court of single subject matter or a court of specialist subject matter such as the Family Court or an Industrial Court. The Court has such original jurisdiction as is vested in it by laws made by the Parliament (s 19(1) of the Act; s 77(i) of the Constitution (having regard to ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution )). The Court is invested with jurisdiction by hundreds of Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament (171 of the 'principal Acts' are set out in Appendix 4 to the Annual Report of the Federal Court of Australia 2005-2006; the 'Notice to Practitioners Conduct of Admiralty &amp; Maritime Work December 2005' identifies 24 Acts conferring jurisdiction in matters relating to admiralty and maritime work of the Court) in a broad range of subject matter attracting almost every facet of the exercise of Commonwealth legislative power which in turn, touches the rights, entitlements and obligations of citizens in matters within the field of that broad subject matter. In that sense, the Court's jurisdiction is broad and in that sense only, general. The Court is not, however, a Court of unlimited jurisdiction. It is entirely statutory. It is invested with jurisdiction in 'matters' whose content derives from the statute conferring jurisdiction (see generally, Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510; Re McBain; Ex parte Aust. Bishops [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 188 ALR 1). Importantly, the Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth (s 71 of the Constitution ) as a Chapter III federal court. The Court thus exercises the judicial power of our national polity. When the Court exercises judicial power, it does so to quell controversies arising within the limits of the Court's jurisdiction although it exercises an accrued jurisdiction to determine all matters in controversy of which a federal claim forms part including those parts of a controversy arising under claims recognised by the common law or derived from legislation of a State provided there is a demonstrated unifying or 'common substratum of fact'. The exercise of the accrued jurisdiction means that litigants, particularly citizens (either corporate or individual), might resolve all matters in controversy in one forum as part of a single 'justicable controversy' and so avoid a citizen wasting time and financial resources in framing another controversy in another forum concerning the same subject matter. Of course, questions will sometimes necessarily arise as to whether there is a single 'justicable controversy'; whether a particular claim is separate, distinct and severable and whether a particular claim attracts an element of Federal jurisdiction. A non-Federal claim or matter, however, does not cease to be within the jurisdiction of the Court should the Federal question be decided adversely to the applicant, be struck out or found unnecessary to determine. At the threshold, the Court although deciding in a particular case that its jurisdiction is not enlivened, nevertheless has jurisdiction to decide it has no jurisdiction.

33 Although references occur in the Authorities to the 'inherent jurisdiction' of the Court ( McDermott v Richmond Sales (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 , per Kenny J; Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 , per Sciopis J) the term is an inaccurate description of the 'incidental and necessary power' exercised by a statutory court ( DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 241[25], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) as the term 'inherent jurisdiction' is a reference to a jurisdiction subsisting 'without the aid of any authorising provisions' ( R v Forbes ; ex parte Bevan per Menzies J, at p 7). The distinction between a jurisdiction or power derived by implication from statutory provisions and a jurisdiction drawn from the 'well of undefined powers available to the common law courts at Westminster'( Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16) is 'fundamental' ( DJL v Central Authority [26]).</text>

Bishops [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 188 ALR 1). Importantly, the Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth (s 71 of the Constitution ) as a Chapter III federal court. The Court thus exercises the judicial power of our national polity. When the Court exercises judicial power, it does so to quell controversies arising within the limits of the Court's jurisdiction although it exercises an accrued jurisdiction to determine all matters in controversy of which a federal claim forms part including those parts of a controversy arising under claims recognised by the common law or derived from legislation of a State provided there is a demonstrated unifying or 'common substratum of fact'. The exercise of the accrued jurisdiction means that litigants, particularly citizens (either corporate or individual), might resolve all matters in controversy in one forum as part of a single 'justicable controversy' and so avoid a citizen wasting time and financial resources in framing another controversy in another forum concerning the same subject matter. Of course, questions will sometimes necessarily arise as to whether there is a single 'justicable controversy'; whether a particular claim is separate, distinct and severable and whether a particular claim attracts an element of Federal jurisdiction. A non-Federal claim or matter, however, does not cease to be within the jurisdiction of the Court should the Federal question be decided adversely to the applicant, be struck out or found unnecessary to determine. At the threshold, the Court although deciding in a particular case that its jurisdiction is not enlivened, nevertheless has jurisdiction to decide it has no jurisdiction.</text>

<text>31 The Federal Court of Australia is created by s 5 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and the Court is 'a superior court of record and is a court of law and equity'. Those words of extension 'and a court of law and equity' are not part of the formulation seen in s 21(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of the Family Court or in s 98 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) concerning the Commonwealth Industrial Court, considered in R v Forbes ; Ex parte Bevan [1972] HCA 34 ; (1972) 127 CLR 1. The Court is not a court of what might be described as essentially a court of single subject matter or a court of specialist subject matter such as the Family Court or an Industrial Court. The Court has such original jurisdiction as is vested in it by laws made by the Parliament (s 19(1) of the Act; s 77(i) of the Constitution (having regard to ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution )). The Court is invested with jurisdiction by hundreds of Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament (171 of the 'principal Acts' are set out in Appendix 4 to the Annual Report of the Federal Court of Australia 2005-2006; the 'Notice to Practitioners Conduct of Admiralty &amp; Maritime Work December 2005' identifies 24 Acts conferring jurisdiction in matters relating to admiralty and maritime work of the Court) in a broad range of subject matter attracting almost every facet of the exercise of Commonwealth legislative power which in turn, touches the rights, entitlements and obligations of citizens in matters within the field of that broad subject matter. In that sense, the Court's jurisdiction is broad and in that sense only, general. The Court is not, however, a Court of unlimited jurisdiction. It is entirely statutory. It is invested with jurisdiction in 'matters' whose content derives from the statute conferring jurisdiction (see generally, Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510; Re McBain; Ex parte Aust. Bishops [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 188 ALR 1). Importantly, the Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth (s 71 of the Constitution ) as a Chapter III federal court.

38 The right of appeal to the Full Court of the Court is conferred by the Act and the terms of the statutory grant determine the nature of the appeal 'and consequential matters' ( DJL v The Central Authority [40]) and those matters include 'the susceptibility of orders made by the Court in its appellate jurisdiction to re-opening after they have been entered ( DJL [40]). Although the Federal Court, as a court of broadly invested jurisdiction across the subject matter of the Commonwealth's legislative power, might find within its jurisdiction powers necessarily implied by reason of the conjunction of the statutory structure creating the Court, its role and sources of jurisdiction and the description of the Court as a superior Court of record and a court of law and equity, as compared with a Court of single or specific subject matter, the considerations at [45], [46] and [47] of DJL are, in my view, decisive of the power of the Court to re-open a judgment and orders of the Full Court especially having regard to s 73 of the Constitution and provisions in the Act conferring on the High Court a jurisdiction to hear and determine (s 33(1)) appeals from judgments of the Full Court with special leave of the High Court (s 33(3)).

39 The observations are these:
 
 
 45 The Family Law Act in its text and structure provides no express conferral of the power sought to be exercised in the present case. Nor is there an inherent power by reason of the description in the statute creating the court of it as 'a superior court of record'. Further, no such power is derived by necessary implication from the statutory structure, in particular from the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred by Pt X of the Family Law Act . 
 
 
 
 
 
 46 A power in the Full Court of the nature for which the appellant contends is not to be found by necessary implication from Ch III of the Constitution . Rather, the Constitution itself deals with the perceived injustice of which the appellant complains in the federal court system. Complaints that orders made by the Full Court should be set aside for error of law, apparent in the reasons for judgment, are to be vindicated through the exercise by this Court of its power conferred by s 73 of the Constitution . 
 
 
 
 
 
 47 The Family Court is a federal court within the meaning of s 73(ii) of the Constitution . Thus, this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders and sentences of the Family Court with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes. An appeal lies from a decree of the Family Court exercising appellate jurisdiction by special leave of this Court (s 95(a)). ...</text>

<text>41 Accordingly, there is no power in the Federal Court to re-open orders of the Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction once perfected by entry. Since there is no power , no question of exceptional circumstances or extraordinary circumstances or any other circumstance irrespective of the language of emphasis that might be adopted, arises. In this case, none are demonstrated in any event ( Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others [No. 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 per Mason CJ 'What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction [by the High Court in respect of an earlier decision of that Court], is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the parties seeking the re-hearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases'; '... it is a jurisdiction to be exercised cautiously, bearing in mind the public interest in the finality of litigation', per Dawson J at p 317).

42 Accordingly, the source of the power to achieve the objective of the attainment of justice between parties to a particular controversy, in a meritorious case, is through the exercise by the High Court of the appellate power conferred upon that Court exercised with the special leave of that Court.
