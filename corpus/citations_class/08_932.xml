<text>1 Judgment on liability was handed down on 18 April 2008: Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 504. Subsequently I heard argument as to some aspects of the relief sought.

2 The applicants (collectively B &amp; D) seek, inter alia, the following orders:
 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1. The Respondent has infringed claims 1 and 3 to 8 (inclusive) of Australian Standard Patent No. 757412 ("the Standard Patent") by exploiting in Australia the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No. TRM50 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark I"). 2. The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 6 (inclusive) of the Standard Patent by exploiting in Australia the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No. TRM51 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark II"). 3. The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 5 (inclusive) of Australian Innovation Patent No. 2002100583 ("the Innovation Patent") by exploiting in Australia the Tyrannosaw Mark I. 4. The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 5 (inclusive) of the Innovation Patent by exploiting in Australia the Tyrannosaw Mark II. THE COURT CERTIFIES THAT: 5. For the purposes of s 19 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), the validity of claims 1 to 8 of the Standard Patent was questioned unsuccessfully in these proceedings. 6. For the purposes of s 19 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), the validity of claims 1 to 5 of the Standard Patent was questioned unsuccessfully in these proceedings. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 7. The Respondent whether by itself, its directors, officers, servants or agents or otherwise howsoever during the term of the Standard Patent is restrained from infringing claims 1 to 8 inclusive of the Standard Patent and in particular, from: 
 
 (a) importing, making, selling, supplying, or otherwise disposing of or offering to make, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of or using or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things,, the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No. TRM 50 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark I");
 
 (b) importing, making, selling, supplying, or otherwise disposing of or offering to make, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of or using or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No. TRM 51 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark II");
 
 (c) authorising any person to do any act which would be a breach of the injunction referred to 7(a) and (b) above.

3 Senior counsel for GMCA argued that the findings of the Court in relation to the Standard Patent concerned only claim 6, which dealt specifically with a power tool used as a panel saw and a jigsaw (see the full text of the claims of the Standard Patent at [16] of the substantive judgment).

15 Another factor is a rather indulgent attitude often taken towards amendment and adjournment applications, in reliance on Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146. However, there is a limit, as was demonstrated in the present case when Finkelstein J refused GMCA a further adjournment of the trial date. I refused leave to appeal from this decision and an application by GMCA for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed: GMCA Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker Inc [2007] HCATrans 662.</text>

<text>35 Some latitude needs to be allowed for the changing of a party's case as investigations reveal possible new arguments. But a line has to be drawn somewhere. Otherwise cases would never get to trial. When, as often happens today, and did so in the present case, there is no interlocutory injunction in place, an ultimately successful patentee may suffer loss which is difficult or impossible to quantify. In the present case B &amp; D claims that costs wasted or duplicated by reason of GMCA's fourth (19 December 2006) and fifth (18 April 2007) particulars of invalidity should be ordered on an indemnity basis. I agree. One of the established categories for which indemnity costs may be ordered is where a party has conducted its case so as to
 grossly prolong the litigation, thereby causing (the other party) to incur costs far beyond what they could reasonably have expected to incur in litigation of the genuine issues.

<text>7 As a general rule a court should be reluctant to undertake an enquiry as to who was successful on particular issues for the purpose of determining whether there should be an apportionment of costs against the successful party: see Dr Martens v Figgins Holdings (No 2) [2000] FCA 602 at [54] where Goldberg J said:
 A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue. 
See also Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 16.

8 In the present case B &amp; D did not fail on all issues relating to the design. The design infringement issue did not take up a major part of the design case, still less of the total hearing. From a commercial aspect it was understandable that B &amp; D should pursue design infringement as well as the Standard and Innovation Patent infringements as they were all bound up with the one product. Also, the design infringement issue, turning as it did essentially on visual inspection, did not become the subject of very detailed expert evidence, although there was some. There was no witness whose evidence was confined to design infringement, the one issue on which GMCA succeeded.

9 All in all I think it is reasonable not to make any reduction of the general award in favour of B &amp; D.

10 B &amp; D submits that it should receive at an indemnity level an award of costs thrown away in relation to:
 
&#8226; repeated changes in GMCA's case;
 
&#8226; loss of the trial date in April 2007; and
 
&#8226; failure to respond reasonably to notices to admit.</text>

<text>15 Another factor is a rather indulgent attitude often taken towards amendment and adjournment applications, in reliance on Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146. However, there is a limit, as was demonstrated in the present case when Finkelstein J refused GMCA a further adjournment of the trial date. I refused leave to appeal from this decision and an application by GMCA for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed: GMCA Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker Inc [2007] HCATrans 662.

22 On 18 August 2006 Finkelstein J set the matter down for trial with an estimate of five days commencing 10 April 2007 and gave directions as to the filing of evidence.

23 On 16 November 2006 GMCA's solicitors wrote to B &amp; D's solicitors requesting an extra month in which to file its evidence in chief on invalidity. It appeared from that letter that 
 
(a) GMCA had only appointed its experts on 23 October and 3 November 2006 (that is, over a year since the proceeding commenced);
 
(b) one of those experts was currently overseas making it difficult to finalise his affidavit;
 
(c) prior art searches were still being conducted in review;
 
(d) GMCA was having difficulty locating prior art and was still attempting to locate additional witnesses; and
 
(d) GMCA's patent attorney was taken ill on 11 November.

24 On 27 November 2006 Finkelstein J extended the time for filing of evidence (evidence in chief by both parties 15 December 2006, GMCA answering evidence 16 February 2007, B &amp; D answering evidence 2 March 2007) and directed that no evidence could be filed thereafter.

25 On 15 December 2006 GMCA filed its evidence.

26 On 19 December 2006 GMCA filed its fourth particulars of invalidity. These added 11 further anticipations in relation to the patents in suit and eight in relation to the design.

27 On 20 March 2007 GMCA was granted leave by Finkelstein J to amend its particulars of invalidity and file further evidence in relation to new prior art. As a consequence, on 11 April 2007 his Honour made orders vacating the trial date and fixing a new trial date of 19 November 2007. His Honour gave directions as to the further filing of evidence.

28 On 18 April 2007 GMCA filed its fifth particulars of invalidity. These deleted 25 pieces of prior art that had previously been cited against the patents and introduced 11 new pieces. The particulars also deleted six pieces of prior art that had previously been cited against the design and introduced one new piece of prior art.

29 Since the adjournment of the trial a further four affidavits were filed on behalf of GMCA in May 2007. A further five affidavits were filed on behalf of B &amp; D in July 2007 and a further five affidavits on behalf of GMCA between August and October 2007.

30 On 5 October GMCA sought a further postponement of the trial date. As already mentioned, this application was rejected by Finkelstein J, who gave reasons on 26 October. His Honour said at [6] that GMCA's non compliance was "not excusable". His Honour continued:
 Indeed this case is a particularly bad one as regards delay... Initially the trial was fixed to begin on 10 April 2007. On the eve of the trial the respondent said it was not ready to begin the hearing and sought leave to introduce further prior art with which to attack both the patent and the design. Leave was granted so that the respondent was not shut out from running its best case.

31 His Honour noted that a consequence was the trial had to be vacated. It was refixed to commence on 19 November and a new timetable was set in place. His Honour noted:
 [7] ...When these orders were made it was made clear that neither party was to use its right of reply as an opportunity to add to its evidence in chief. [8] Despite the orders (or in defiance of them) the respondent has served two reply affidavits in which it seeks to add to its evidence in chief. The affidavits were filed without leave. The application for leave to rely on the additional material was made orally at the recent case management conference.

32 His Honour then went on to note how the affidavits referred to, and produced, new prior art. His Honour refused leave to rely on any additional material.

33 In the event, by the time of its closing submissions at trial GMCA relied on only seven pieces of prior art, two of which had not been pleaded. This is to be contrasted with the pleading at various stages of no less than 45 pieces of prior art.

34 B &amp; D was put to significant wasted expense dealing with alleged anticipations which ultimately were not relied on by GMCA. Many of these took the form of patents, which required careful analysis by B &amp; D's experts and lawyers.

37 Much of B &amp; D's work and evidence up to that time was wasted and B &amp; D was forced to prepare for a trial seven months later. As Finkelstein J noted in the passage already quoted, the case was "a particularly bad one as regards delay". I reject GMCA's argument that B &amp; D was somehow equally to blame because it was a day late in serving exhibits to some of its affidavits.

38 B &amp; D should receive costs on an indemnity basis for costs wasted or duplicated by reason of this adjournment of the trial date.

39 On 12 October 2006, that is almost a year after the commencement of proceedings and about six months before the scheduled trial date, B &amp; D's solicitors served a notice to admit facts on GMCA. By this stage the parties had completed discovery but had not filed any evidence.</text>

<tocase>Ungar v Sugg (1899) 9 RPC 113</tocase>
<text>11 These issues need to be seen in the context of the tortuous history of this case. That progress, or lack thereof, brings to mind the statement of Lord Esher MR in Ungar v Sugg (1899) 9 RPC 113 at 117 recently cited by Jacob LJ in Nichia Corporation v Argos Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 741 at [1] :
 A man had better have his patent infringed, or have anything happen to him in this world, short of losing all his family by influenza, than have a dispute about a patent. His patent is swallowed up, and he is ruined. Whose fault is it? It is really not the fault of the law: it is the fault of the mode of conducting the law in a patent case. That is what causes all this mischief.

12 Jacob LJ, England's pre-eminent patent judge, continued:
 [2] What causes cost is time: time spent by lawyers, experts and the parties themselves. Lawyers' and experts' time is normally measured and costed. Because they are highly skilled, lawyers' and experts' time is expensive. Time spent by the parties themselves is generally irrecoverable. [3] It follows as night follows day that every issue or topic in a patent action which causes significant expenditure of time will contribute to the overall cost.

13 Those observations apply equally to patent litigation in this country. Some additional points can be made. In most commercial litigation the relevant events, the creation of documents, the conversations, the payment or non-payment of money etc, have already occurred by the time the litigation commences. With patent litigation, however, much of the critical evidence is from experts and only comes into existence after the proceedings have been launched and those experts have been located and retained and have prepared their evidence. All this takes time, and since both sides face the same kind of problems there is a natural tendency for mutual accommodation: "We understand you need an extra three months to get Professor X's evidence, just give us an extra three months after that to get Dr Y's".</text>

<text>5 It is proper to have an injunction not only referring to particular products found to have infringed, but also in respect of any other infringing products which the infringer might produce or sell: see Welcome Real-Time SA v Catuity Inc (No 2) [2001] FCA 785.

6 I held that B &amp; D's design was valid but not infringed. Thus each side had some success in relating to design issues. GMCA says that it should recover its costs on those issues or at least on the infringement issue. B &amp; D says there should be no reduction of a general order as to costs in relation to design issues or at worst there should be no order as to costs.</text>
