<text>In support of the motions reference was made to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which was inserted in that Act by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth) Pt 7 Sch 1 which provides for striking out of claims or defences which do not have a reasonable prospect of success. However, that provision does not apply to proceedings like the present one which were commenced before the amendment. As a consequence I must apply the high standard mandated by General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 and Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62, namely that the case is "so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed".</text>

<tocase>Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/8.html</AustLII>
<text>Both senior counsel for the valuers relied particularly on what was said by Brennan CJ in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241, a claim brought by a financier against the auditors of a borrower corporation. The High Court held that the statement of claim did not disclose a cause of action in negligence against the auditors. His Honour said at 252 
 
 "... that mere foreseeability of the possibility that a statement made or advice given by A to B might be communicated to a class of which C is a member and that C might enter into some transaction as the result thereof and suffer financial loss is not sufficient to impose on A duty of care owed to C in the making of the statement or the giving of the advice." 
 

However his Honour went on to say:
 
 "But, in every case, it is necessary for the plaintiff to allege and prove that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the information or advice would be communicated to the plaintiff, either individually or as a member of an identified class, that the information or advice would be so communicated for a purpose that would be very likely to lead the plaintiff to enter into a transaction of the kind that the plaintiff does enter into and that it would be very likely that the plaintiff would enter into such a transaction or reliance on the information or advice and thereby risk the incurring of economic loss if the statement should be untrue or the advice should be unsound. If any of these elements be wanting, the plaintiff fails to establish that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in making this statement or giving advice. The statement of claim does not plead these elements."

The significance of the pleading in that case was pointed out by Gaudron J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 where her Honour said at [30] that in Esanda : 
 
 "... it was not pleaded that the auditors in question knew or ought to have known that a finance provider would rely on their audited statement of accounts and thus, it was held, on the pleadings, that no duty of care was owed by the auditors to the finance provider." 
 

In the present case of course, as has been seen, that matter has been pleaded in pars 39A and 52A.

It seems to me to be arguable, at least for the purpose of resisting a strike-out application, that an identified class in the sense used by Brennan CJ would include the class of persons who were clients of Boyds and who had requested Boyds to seek the advice of valuers in relation to these particular properties, in a context where no doubt Boyds themselves were providing other financial advice. The circumstance that a Melbourne firm of accountants was seeking valuations of farming properties in Tasmania itself arguably tends to show that the valuations were not being sought by the accountants themselves acting as principals.

In support of the motions reliance was placed on the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen [1999] NSWCA 202 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 1. Senior counsel referred to what was said by Giles JA said at [17]: 
 
 "So a valuer who puts out a negligent valuation does not incur an open ended liability to any and every financier who relies on it, even if it was reasonably foreseeable that the financer would rely on it. The particular financier may be outside the class of person to whom the valuer owes a duty to take care in making the statement in the valuation, in the same manner as Esanda was outside the class of persons to whom the auditors owed a duty of care on the case as pleaded in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241; the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel, but not to Esanda."</text>

<text>The significance of the pleading in that case was pointed out by Gaudron J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 where her Honour said at [30] that in Esanda : 
 
 "... it was not pleaded that the auditors in question knew or ought to have known that a finance provider would rely on their audited statement of accounts and thus, it was held, on the pleadings, that no duty of care was owed by the auditors to the finance provider." 
 

In the present case of course, as has been seen, that matter has been pleaded in pars 39A and 52A.

The case is certainly not authority for any proposition that a valuer only owes a duty of care to the client who directly retains him or her. If that were the law, there would have been a short answer to the plaintiff's claim since the chain went from valuer defendant to owner to solicitor to lender plaintiff. On the facts, as Handley JA noted at [6], it was not a case where the valuer contemplated that a class of persons might rely on his valuation. Giles JA at [24] pointed out that where a valuer puts out a negligent valuation the class of persons to whom the duty of care 
 
 "...will normally be confined, apart from any other considerations, to those persons whom the valuer knows or ought to know will reasonably rely on the valuation." (Emphasis in original) 
 

In other words, given expectation of reasonable reliance, there can be a duty owed by a valuer to a class of persons. The identification of that class will obviously depend on the circumstances.
 
 23 Perre , a decision of the High Court handed down shortly after Ta Ho Ma, demonstrates the flexibility and pragmatism of the law of negligence in identifying the class of persons to whom a duty of care is owed in a particular case and the absence of any bright line rule: see per Gleeson CJ at [7]. It was held that the defendant, which brought infected seed potatoes on to a farm in South Australia, owed a duty of care to growers within 20 kilometres of the farm because such persons would be prevented by Western Australian law from exporting potatoes to that State. The plaintiffs "were members of a class whose members, whether numerous or not, were ascertainable by (the defendant)": per McHugh J at [50]. As I have said, it is arguable that in the present case there was an identifiable class constituted by clients of Boyds on whose behalf that firm was seeking the valuations in connection with some commercial dealing involving the specified properties. The disclaimers are not conclusive if, as a matter of fact, the valuers must be taken to have expected that such clients of Boyds would reasonably rely on the valuations. Otherwise, one might ask, what would be the point of obtaining the valuations? It was also argued that the allegations of reliance were "mere statements of conclusion". However reliance can be inferred from the representations contained in the valuations and the applicant's purchase of the properties: Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 230, Henderson v Amadio (No1) (1995) 62 FCR 1 at 166, Hanave Pty Ltd v LFOT Pty Ltd (1999) 43 IPR 545 at [45]. To the extent that such authorities deal with proof of reliance in the context of causation there is no logical ground why the reasoning should not apply where reliance is an element in the establishment of a duty of care. On behalf of Mantach it was submitted that the pleading "does not identify the qualities and standards by which it says that only 35.9 ha of Broadmoor was available for cropping". This seems to be a matter of evidence. In this context it would seem that pyrethrum is the kind of cropping referred to. The particulars of negligence are reasonably specific and do, contrary to the submissions on behalf of Mantach, identify the basis upon which it is alleged that the firm departed from the standard of care required of an expert in arriving at an opinion. In particular, it appears to be alleged that the valuers failed to independently check the cropping area and simply relied on the vendors. The motions will be dismissed with costs. Counsel for the applicant conceded that some formal amendments may be needed to the statement of claim. There will be leave to file and serve a further amended statement of claim within fourteen days.

In Ta Ho Ma an owner of property obtained a valuation from the defendant. Some 81/2 months later the owner telephoned a solicitor (apparently not the owner's own solicitor) seeking a loan and advising of the valuation. The solicitor in turn contacted the plaintiff who advanced a loan on the basis of the defendant's valuation which by this time was 91/2 months old. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff because, having regard to the age of the valuation, there could be no expectation of reasonable reliance by the plaintiff: see per Handley JA at [12]-[14], per Giles JA at [18], [24], [28], per Sheppard AJA at [105].

The case is certainly not authority for any proposition that a valuer only owes a duty of care to the client who directly retains him or her. If that were the law, there would have been a short answer to the plaintiff's claim since the chain went from valuer defendant to owner to solicitor to lender plaintiff.
