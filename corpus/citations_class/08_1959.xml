<text>1 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, delivered on 1 August 2008 and published as SZMDG v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1075. The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), signed on 27 February 2008 and handed down or sent on 18 March 2008. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to this appeal, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), to refuse to grant to the appellant a protection visa.

2 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who:
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country

3 The appellant is a citizen of Indonesia, who arrived in Australia on 14 August 2007. On 27 September 2007, he applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate refusing to grant the visa was made on 15 November 2007. The appellant then applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</text>
