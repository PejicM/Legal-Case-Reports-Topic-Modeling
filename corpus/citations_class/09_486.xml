<text>Moreover, if the proposed Ground were to be pursued, there would be a need to resolve as a factual issue the question as to what was and what was not put to the now Appellant during the course of the Tribunal hearing. A submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister by his Senior Counsel as to prejudice should the Ground be entertained is not to be dismissed lightly. Prejudice is claimed by reason of a lost " opportunity to call evidence to rebut the proposed allegations about what issues were raised and how they were raised at the Tribunal's three hearings ". It is appropriate to refuse leave to amend where " it may be unfair to the respondent, who may have been able to call evidence at first instance to rebut the proposed allegations, if they had been made at that stage ": Applicant A376 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 222 at [2] per Tamberlin, Madgwick and Hely JJ. Leave to amend should also be rejected on this further basis.

Even if leave were granted, the proposed Ground would be rejected.

The Appeal is to be dismissed. The written outline of submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister seeks costs. The Appellant accepted that if the appeal was to be dismissed, there was no reason why costs should not follow the event. Although the Minister may not have prevailed in respect to all of the contentions sought to be advanced in his Notice of Contention , he has substantially prevailed. The appeal is thus to be dismissed with costs.</text>

<text>Reference to a particular issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal may provide a basis upon which a conclusion may be reached that that issue was in fact addressed and considered during the course of a Tribunal hearing. But the difficulty in drawing an inference that an issue was not addressed because of the absence of any reference to that issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal is a difficulty that has been adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241. When addressing a submission that an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal did not raise an issue with the appellant, Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ there observed: 
 [21] We cannot accept this submission, for several reasons. 

 
 For one thing, as the respondent submitted, the appellant's case is premised upon an assumption (that was also made by the learned Magistrate, albeit on a tentative basis), namely, that the Tribunal had not raised the issue of the authenticity of certain documents with the appellant at the hearing. However, his Honour did not make a finding in relation to this matter. Driver FM observed that this 'appeared' to be the case 'from the record of the [Tribunal] decision'. On the evidence before his Honour, it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed. His Honour had no transcript. (As mentioned, the tape is before us and we refer to it below.) The appellant had not given any evidence (in affidavit form or orally) to the effect that this issue had not been raised. There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding. His reasons should not be read as if he did so. In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the appelant [ sic ] has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise, thus he has not, in our opinion, established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice. 

 
Their Honours were obviously directing attention to the facts then before the Court. But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded. The decision in NAOA has since been followed: NBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1132 at [31] per Conti J. The Full Court, it has also been said, " simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case ": SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 at [32] , 102 ALD 598 at 606 per Rares J. In an appropriate case, inferences may be drawn from an account given by a Tribunal member: e.g. Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 at [28] to [30] [2004] HCA 62 ; , 221 CLR 1 at 10 to 11 per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. Whether an inference is or is not available must obviously depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/33.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the Appellant accepts what must inevitably be common ground as between the parties. It is thus accepted that a party is normally bound by the manner in which it has previously conducted its case: Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68. Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ there observed at 71: 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. 

 
Applied: Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 105 at [18], 190 ALR 543 at 548 to 549 per Hill, O'Loughlin and Tamberlin JJ; SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [33] , 104 ALD 22 at 30. Similarly, in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed at 7:
 
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCATrans/2008/404.html</AustLII>
<text>This provision, it has repeatedly been acknowledged, " suffers from a lack of clarity ": SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515. Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision: 
 [10] In a series of cases decided under s 91R(3) , it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity. Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise, it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection. First, the subsection is cast in imperative terms: it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph (b). Secondly, the stipulation that a decision maker must "disregard" an applicant's conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason. Thirdly, although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s 91R(3) of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims, it is not, in terms, so confined. Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant's country of origin, would support a sur place claim. Other types of conduct may not. Section 91R(3) obliges decision makers to disregard "any" conduct by the applicant in Australia. That requirement is qualified by paragraph (b) which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct "otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claims to be a refugee ...". Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person's claim to be a refugee. So too, however, would conduct in Australia which, in an evidentiary sense, rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country. Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia. ... 

 
Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s 91R(3). Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct, deliberately pursued in Australia, to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin: [2008] FCAFC 105 at [24] . Special leave to appeal, it should be noted, has been granted: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJXO [2008] HCATrans 404.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the Appellant resisted such a conclusion and submitted that the Tribunal's reasons did not disclose any finding as to " purpose ". He accepted that the Tribunal's reasons were not to be scrutinised in an " over-zealous " manner and with an " eye keenly attuned to the perception of error ": Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 271 to 272, see also Kirby J at 291; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [25] , [2007] HCA 26 ; 96 ALD 1 at 9 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Black v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [36] , [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 9.

The present facts would also appear to stand in contrast to those in SZBEL where Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ observed: 
 [3] ... At no stage did the Tribunal challenge what the appellant said, express any reaction to what he said, or invite him to amplify any of the three particular aspects of the account he had given in his statutory declaration, and repeated in his evidence, which the Tribunal later found to be 'implausible'... [2006] HCA 63 at [3] , [2006] HCA 63 ; 228 CLR 152 at 155. 

 
Contrary to the case sought to be advanced on behalf of the Appellant that he was denied the opportunity guaranteed by s 425 by not having the question as to the genuineness of his faith specifically put to him, upon a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons (cf Liang, supra) it emerges that the Tribunal did " challenge " the Appellant's account. The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus recount the following exchange:
 
 [96] ... I also mentioned to the applicant that it was of concern to the Tribunal that he did not tell his agent his real name or that he was in fear of religious persecution. It was also of concern to the Tribunal that he did not attend church until 15 November 2000, even though he arrived in Australia in June 1999. I mentioned to the applicant that a chronology of his applications indicated that he had exhausted all lines of application by August 2000. The applicant stated that he did not know his application had been rejected. I mentioned to the applicant that it was difficult for the Tribunal to understand why he did not attend the church before November 2000 given his claims of being a committed Christian. I mentioned to the applicant that he told the Tribunal that the reason he attended an underground church in China was because he valued the community spirit which was not available at the official church. I mentioned to the applicant that if that was the case it was difficult to see why he did not seek that out as soon as he arrived in Australia where he could do so freely. The applicant stated that he had no Christian friends so he worshiped [ sic ] on his own. 

 
 [97] I discussed with the applicant section 91R(3) of the Act. The applicant stated that he did not go to church with the intention of enhancing his refugee claims.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/138.html</AustLII>
<text>The " object of the section must be to provide procedural fairness to the applicant by alerting the applicant to material that the Tribunal considers to be adverse to the applicant's case and affording the applicant the opportunity to comment upon it ": SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 at [50] , [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294 at 312 per McHugh J. Subject to the qualifications and exceptions set forth, " the evident object of s 424A is that ... fairness to the applicant is to be provided by alerting the applicant to adverse material and affording an opportunity to comment upon it ": [2005] HCA 24 at [118] , [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294 at 331 per Gummow J. It was made clear in SAAP that the Tribunal commits jurisdictional error if it fails to comply with the requirements of s 424A. The purpose sought to be achieved by s 424A , it has also been recognised, is twofold: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZGMF [2006] FCAFC 138. Branson, Finn and Bennett JJ there observed: 
 [31] The obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 424A relevantly had two aspects; first, to give the respondent particulars of any information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review (s 424A(1)(a)) and secondly, to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the respondent understood why the information was relevant to the review (s 424A(1)(b)).</text>

<text>A principal consideration to be taken into account when exercising the discretion is the interest of the proper administration of justice and the need to ensure that a decision has been made in a procedurally fair manner and in accordance with law. In some cases arguments have been entertained and leave granted to file a Notice of Contention even after the conclusion of a hearing: e.g. MZKAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 428.

A further consideration relevant to the exercise of discretion is the fact that the issues sought to be pursued in the Notice of Contention are similar to those issues previously advanced before the Federal Magistrate.

In the circumstances it is considered that time should be extended to allow the filing of the Notice of Contention .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/663.html</AustLII>
<text>The proposed new Ground in the present proceeding seeks to contend that the " strict requirements " of s 424A(1)(b) have not been satisfied because the Tribunal's letter forwarded to the Appellant failed to identify the purpose for which information set forth could be used. The letter providing notice to the Appellant of the information in respect to which " comments or response " were sought was dated 28 July 2008. That letter set forth " information " and continued to state as follows: 
 The above information is relevant because it could lead the Tribunal to find that you did not fear persecution in China, as presently claimed. Your statements to the Departmental officers in September 2007 that you were willing to return to China could lead the Tribunal to find that you were not in fear of persecution should you return to China. The fact that you went to the Chinese Consulate and were issued with a travel document in 2005 and your statement to the Departmental officer that you decided not to go to China in 2005 because you could earn more money in Australia could also lead the Tribunal to be unsatisfied in relation to your claims to fear persecution in China. If the Tribunal makes these findings it will not be satisfied about your persecution claims and may affirm the delegate's decision not to grant a protection visa. 
 
 
No complaint is made by the Appellant as to compliance with s 424A(1)(a) &#8212; it is accepted that " clear particulars " of information have been provided. Section 424A(1)(a) requires an applicant to be provided with " sufficient specificity " of the information to be relied upon. Language which fails to identify information with " sufficient specificity " and which fails to " unambiguously " set forth information may fail to comply with s 424A(1)(a): e.g. MZXKH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 663 at [20] per Tracey J.

The argument for the Appellant is that the 28 July 2008 letter put him on notice that the information previously set forth in the letter could be used merely for the purpose of making a finding that the Appellant did not fear persecution as claimed. The contravention arose &#8212; so it was argued &#8212; because the letter did not state that the information could also be used for the purpose of making a finding as to credibility.

The argument is rejected.</text>

<text>Reference to a particular issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal may provide a basis upon which a conclusion may be reached that that issue was in fact addressed and considered during the course of a Tribunal hearing. But the difficulty in drawing an inference that an issue was not addressed because of the absence of any reference to that issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal is a difficulty that has been adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241. When addressing a submission that an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal did not raise an issue with the appellant, Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ there observed: 
 [21] We cannot accept this submission, for several reasons. 

 
 For one thing, as the respondent submitted, the appellant's case is premised upon an assumption (that was also made by the learned Magistrate, albeit on a tentative basis), namely, that the Tribunal had not raised the issue of the authenticity of certain documents with the appellant at the hearing. However, his Honour did not make a finding in relation to this matter. Driver FM observed that this 'appeared' to be the case 'from the record of the [Tribunal] decision'. On the evidence before his Honour, it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed. His Honour had no transcript. (As mentioned, the tape is before us and we refer to it below.) The appellant had not given any evidence (in affidavit form or orally) to the effect that this issue had not been raised. There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding. His reasons should not be read as if he did so. In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the appelant [ sic ] has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise, thus he has not, in our opinion, established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice. 

 
Their Honours were obviously directing attention to the facts then before the Court. But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded. The decision in NAOA has since been followed: NBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1132 at [31] per Conti J. The Full Court, it has also been said, " simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case ": SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 at [32] , 102 ALD 598 at 606 per Rares J. In an appropriate case, inferences may be drawn from an account given by a Tribunal member: e.g. Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 at [28] to [30] [2004] HCA 62 ; , 221 CLR 1 at 10 to 11 per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. Whether an inference is or is not available must obviously depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.

The difficulties adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA are only compounded in the present appeal when attention is directed to the Tribunal's reasons for decision and its account as to that which occurred during the course of the three hearings &#8212; the first being held on 23 June 2008, the second on 10 July 2008 and the resumed hearing on 24 July 2008. The first hearing took some 3 hours, the second some 2.5 hours and the third some 2 hours. Notwithstanding the length of each of the hearings, the Tribunal's summary of that which occurred was somewhat brief. No criticism is made of the Tribunal in so summarising the events that took place before it. But the very fact that the summary provided is necessarily so brief renders it very unsafe in the present proceeding to draw any inference that a particular issue was not addressed because it is not mentioned in the summary provided.

Second, if a process of inference were engaged in, it would tell against the Appellant.

Submissions advanced on behalf of the Appellant after the conclusion of the hearing thus addressed the question as to the Appellant's religious practices, including a submission stating in part as follows: 
 In this matter, if you find that the applicant is a genuine Christian who is opposed to practicing [ sic ] his faith outside the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC, you must assess the extent of this commitment and whether he has a well-founded fear of being harmed as a consequence of his commitment to the practice of his faith in this manner. 

 
 The Tribunal has been presented with a considerable amount of evidence from people who know the applicant in Australia and who knew him in the PRC. This evidence has been to the effect that the applicant has engaged in the practice of his Christian faith outside the confines of the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC for most of his life. With the exception of a brief period in Australia, the applicant has always practiced his faith publicly by attending religious services. The evidence of Rev. Lawrence in this regard is that the applicant has been a regular attendee at his church for more than 7 years. 

 
 In our submission, the Tribunal ought to accept that the applicant is someone who has demonstrated a commitment to practicing his faith outside the confines of the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC and that he would continue to practice his faith in this manner in the future, even if he were returned to the PRC. 

 
If an inference were drawn, it would be an inference that the now Appellant recognised that an issue needing to be addressed was whether or not the Tribunal should find that he was " a genuine Christian ". Attempts by the Appellant to characterise this and other such submissions as more directed to the nature of the religious activity practised, as opposed to whether or not the Appellant was a genuine Christian, are rejected.</text>

On the evidence before his Honour, it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed. His Honour had no transcript. (As mentioned, the tape is before us and we refer to it below.) The appellant had not given any evidence (in affidavit form or orally) to the effect that this issue had not been raised. There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding. His reasons should not be read as if he did so. In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the appelant [ sic ] has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise, thus he has not, in our opinion, established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice. 

 
Their Honours were obviously directing attention to the facts then before the Court. But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded. The decision in NAOA has since been followed: NBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1132 at [31] per Conti J. The Full Court, it has also been said, " simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case ": SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 at [32] , 102 ALD 598 at 606 per Rares J. In an appropriate case, inferences may be drawn from an account given by a Tribunal member: e.g. Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 at [28] to [30] [2004] HCA 62 ; , 221 CLR 1 at 10 to 11 per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. Whether an inference is or is not available must obviously depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.</text>

<text>By reason of s 425 , an applicant before the Tribunal is entitled to assume that issues considered dispositive by a delegate are the issues which arise in relation to the decision under review &#8212; unless the Tribunal takes steps to notify the applicant to the contrary: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 , 228 CLR 152. Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ there observed: 
 [29] No submission was made on behalf of either the appellant or the Minister that the existence or content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was directly affected by any provision of the Act. Rather, the argument proceeded, for the most part, by reference to what had been said by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone [ Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591 to 592]. The Full Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) said: 

 
Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material . Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question. (emphasis added)
 
Their Honours continued:
 
 [35] The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered. The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". That is why the point at which to begin the identification of issues arising in relation to the decision under review will usually be the reasons given for that decision. And unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the Tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant.

The present facts would also appear to stand in contrast to those in SZBEL where Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ observed: 
 [3] ... At no stage did the Tribunal challenge what the appellant said, express any reaction to what he said, or invite him to amplify any of the three particular aspects of the account he had given in his statutory declaration, and repeated in his evidence, which the Tribunal later found to be 'implausible'... [2006] HCA 63 at [3] , [2006] HCA 63 ; 228 CLR 152 at 155. 

 
Contrary to the case sought to be advanced on behalf of the Appellant that he was denied the opportunity guaranteed by s 425 by not having the question as to the genuineness of his faith specifically put to him, upon a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons (cf Liang, supra) it emerges that the Tribunal did " challenge " the Appellant's account. The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus recount the following exchange:
 
 [96] ... I also mentioned to the applicant that it was of concern to the Tribunal that he did not tell his agent his real name or that he was in fear of religious persecution. It was also of concern to the Tribunal that he did not attend church until 15 November 2000, even though he arrived in Australia in June 1999. I mentioned to the applicant that a chronology of his applications indicated that he had exhausted all lines of application by August 2000. The applicant stated that he did not know his application had been rejected. I mentioned to the applicant that it was difficult for the Tribunal to understand why he did not attend the church before November 2000 given his claims of being a committed Christian. I mentioned to the applicant that he told the Tribunal that the reason he attended an underground church in China was because he valued the community spirit which was not available at the official church. I mentioned to the applicant that if that was the case it was difficult to see why he did not seek that out as soon as he arrived in Australia where he could do so freely. The applicant stated that he had no Christian friends so he worshiped [ sic ] on his own. 

 
 [97] I discussed with the applicant section 91R(3) of the Act. The applicant stated that he did not go to church with the intention of enhancing his refugee claims.</text>

<text>Counsel for the Appellant accepts what must inevitably be common ground as between the parties. It is thus accepted that a party is normally bound by the manner in which it has previously conducted its case: Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68. Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ there observed at 71: 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so.

Similarly, in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed at 7:
 
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/105.html</AustLII>
<text>This provision, it has repeatedly been acknowledged, " suffers from a lack of clarity ": SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515. Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision: 
 [10] In a series of cases decided under s 91R(3) , it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity. Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise, it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection. First, the subsection is cast in imperative terms: it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph (b). Secondly, the stipulation that a decision maker must "disregard" an applicant's conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason. Thirdly, although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s 91R(3) of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims, it is not, in terms, so confined. Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant's country of origin, would support a sur place claim. Other types of conduct may not. Section 91R(3) obliges decision makers to disregard "any" conduct by the applicant in Australia. That requirement is qualified by paragraph (b) which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct "otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claims to be a refugee ...". Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person's claim to be a refugee. So too, however, would conduct in Australia which, in an evidentiary sense, rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country. Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia. ... 

 
Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s 91R(3). Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct, deliberately pursued in Australia, to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin: [2008] FCAFC 105 at [24] . Special leave to appeal, it should be noted, has been granted: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJXO [2008] HCATrans 404.

It is unnecessary to resolve a third contention advanced by the Minister. This contention was that s 91R(3) is not engaged where an applicant does not seek to rely on conduct in Australia to support a well-founded fear of persecution (cf SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] per Jacobson J; SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 at [21] per Jacobson J) or where evidence of conduct is adduced or called by an applicant ( SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 at [16] and [21] to [23] per Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ). The contention was that the present Appellant did not seek to rely upon the 1999 or 2000 conduct and did not adduce evidence of such conduct.</text>

<text>Reference to a particular issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal may provide a basis upon which a conclusion may be reached that that issue was in fact addressed and considered during the course of a Tribunal hearing. But the difficulty in drawing an inference that an issue was not addressed because of the absence of any reference to that issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal is a difficulty that has been adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241. When addressing a submission that an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal did not raise an issue with the appellant, Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ there observed: 
 [21] We cannot accept this submission, for several reasons. 

 
 For one thing, as the respondent submitted, the appellant's case is premised upon an assumption (that was also made by the learned Magistrate, albeit on a tentative basis), namely, that the Tribunal had not raised the issue of the authenticity of certain documents with the appellant at the hearing. However, his Honour did not make a finding in relation to this matter. Driver FM observed that this 'appeared' to be the case 'from the record of the [Tribunal] decision'. On the evidence before his Honour, it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed. His Honour had no transcript. (As mentioned, the tape is before us and we refer to it below.) The appellant had not given any evidence (in affidavit form or orally) to the effect that this issue had not been raised. There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding. His reasons should not be read as if he did so. In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the appelant [ sic ] has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise, thus he has not, in our opinion, established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice. 

 
Their Honours were obviously directing attention to the facts then before the Court. But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded. The decision in NAOA has since been followed: NBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1132 at [31] per Conti J. The Full Court, it has also been said, " simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case ": SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 at [32] , 102 ALD 598 at 606 per Rares J. In an appropriate case, inferences may be drawn from an account given by a Tribunal member: e.g. Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 at [28] to [30] [2004] HCA 62 ; , 221 CLR 1 at 10 to 11 per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/18.html</AustLII>
<text>An application for review was filed with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in September 2008 and an amended application was filed in November 2008. The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application: SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 18. In so doing, the Federal Magistrate rejected an allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate, however, further concluded that there had been a breach of s 91R of the Migration Act but declined relief in the exercise of his discretion.

A Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 12 February 2009.

Before the Federal Magistrate, Counsel for the Respondent Minister " submitted that, whilst the Tribunal found that there had been some conduct in Australia, it was entitled to have regard to that conduct in the manner in which it did, having proper regard to the principles that govern s. 91R (3) ": [2009] FMCA 18 at [45] . The Federal Magistrate went on to summarise the submissions then advanced as follows: 
 [46] Specifically, s. 91R(3) did not require the Tribunal to disregard the applicant's participation in religious activities in Australia because it implicitly (emphasis added) found that the applicant's purpose in attending church was for a purpose other than strengthening his protection visa claims, and it explicitly (again, emphasis added) found an alternate explanation for the applicant's attending church, namely companionship. 

 
 [47] Similarly, the applicant's lodgement of an earlier application for a protection visa was not conduct that could be said to enhance the applicant's claims for a protection visa and therefore it was not required by s. 91R (3) to be disregarded. 

 
 [48] Again, the fact that the applicant had obtained a travel document did not need to be disregarded by s. 91R(3). It did not enhance the applicant's claims for refugee status. If anything, this conduct detracted from the applicant's claims for a protection visa. 

 
 [49] Consequently, counsel for the Minister submitted that there was no jurisdictional error constituted by a breach of s. 91R(3) of the Migration Act , or at all. 

 
The Federal Magistrate then went on to resolve submissions directed to other factual matters said to also involve a contravention of s 91R and concluded in respect to the 1999 application and the request for Ministerial intervention in 2000 as follows:
 
 [62] This conduct can not, to my mind, be characterised as conduct that could not be understood as an attempt to enhance the applicant's claim to be a refugee. He certainly practised deception, but the motive appears to be an attempt to enhance his claim for a protection visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal was required to disregard it under the provisions of s. 91R(3). 

 
The Federal Magistrate thereafter went on to decline relief in the exercise of his discretion, reasoning as follows:
 
 [67] What remains to be considered, therefore, is whether the Tribunal's failure to disregard the applicant's conduct in applying for a protection visa in a false name and also applying for the exercise of the Minister's discretion in that same false name is a failure to comply with s. 91R(3) and therefore a jurisdictional error. 

 
 [68] In my view, the Tribunal failed to comply with s. 91R(3) in this instance and therefore fell into jurisdictional error. 

 
 [69] However, I am not satisfied that the Court should grant to the applicant the relief that he seeks. The balance of the evidence before the Tribunal is of such weight that the Tribunal's adverse credibility finding against the applicant can stand even if the evidence of the earlier application for a protection visa and the exercise of the Minister's discretion were to be disregarded. It is not in the interests of the administration of justice for the applicant to be granted relief by way of certiorari and mandamus because of a mere technicality. 

 
It was this exercise of discretion which was the occasion for the Order 80 r 4 referral.

Section 91R(3) provides as follows: 
 For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person: 

 
 (a) in determining whether the person has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for one or more of the reasons mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; 

 
 disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless: 

 
 (b) the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/175.html</AustLII>
<text>The manner in which the Federal Magistrate exercised his discretion was the occasion for a referral to be made pursuant to Order 80 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth): SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 175. Mr Prince of Counsel accepted that referral and appeared as pro bono counsel for the Appellant. The Court is indeed appreciative of his acceptance of the referral and the detailed and careful submissions advanced both in writing and at the hearing of the appeal.

Now before the Court are: 
(i) an application by the Respondent Minister to file a Notice of Contention ;
 
(ii) an application by the Appellant to file an Amended Notice of Appeal ; and 
 
(iii) the existing Notice of Appeal .
 
The Notice of Contention seeks to raise a number of contentions as to the construction of s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and its application to the facts.

The appeal is to be dismissed.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/158.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the Respondent Minister opposed the grant of leave to amend to raise either ground primarily upon the basis that neither ground had any merit. He further opposed the application to raise a contravention of s 425 on the basis of prejudice. The Respondent Minister did not contend that this Court, when hearing an appeal under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) from a Federal Magistrate, does not have jurisdiction to entertain an argument not previously advanced. Indeed, to do otherwise may have precluded him from raising at least some of the contentions sought to be advanced in the Notice of Contention . The jurisdiction of the Court to entertain a new argument was accepted to be only constrained by the well accepted principle as to whether it is " expedient in the interests of justice to do so ...": e.g. VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] per Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ; Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Oke [2007] FCAFC 94 at [17] , [2007] FCAFC 94 ; 159 FCR 441 at 444 per Branson, Lindgren and Besanko JJ.</text>
