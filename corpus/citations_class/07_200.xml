<tocase>Anheuser-Busch v Bud&#283;jovick[yacute] Budvar (2002) 56 IPR 182</tocase>
<text>57 Natural Waters relies on the reputation of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups. The reputation that is relevant to the determination of liability in these proceedings is the reputation in the get-up that existed as at mid December 2005, the commencement of the conduct complained of ( Pub Squash Co at 861; Anheuser-Busch v Bud&#283;jovick[yacute] Budvar (2002) 56 IPR 182 at [237]). The vast majority of sales and promotional activities prior to mid December 2005 related to the 2003 get-up. It follows that, as at the relevant date, absent any evidence to the contrary and absent evidence of reputation specific to the 2005 get-up, Natural Waters' reputation in the 2005 get-up subsists in the features in common between the two versions and the overall impression that they both convey.</text>

<tocase>Apand Pty Ltd v Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474</tocase>
<text>32 Intent is not a necessary element of passing off or contravention of s 52 or s 53 of the Act although it may be relevant if it is shown that there was an intention to deceive ( Apand Pty Ltd v Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496). This may give rise to an inference that the attempt succeeded and that consumers will be deceived ( Sydneywide at [117]). Where there is an intention to copy all or part of a competitor's get-up to obtain a market benefit, differences in get-up may have reduced significance.

33 As Weinberg and Dowsett JJ said in Sydneywide at [117]:
 
 ' [W] here a trader, having knowledge of a particular market, borrows aspects of a competitor's get-up, it is a reasonable inference that he or she believes that there will be a market benefit in so doing. Often, the obvious benefit will be the attraction of custom which would otherwise have gone to the competitor. It is an available inference from those propositions that the trader, with knowledge of the market, considered that such borrowing was "fitted for the purpose and therefore likely to deceive or confuse...". Of course, the trader may explain his or her conduct in such a way as to undermine the availability of that inference. Obviously, this reasoning will only apply where there are similarities in get-up which suggest borrowing .' (my emphasis)

34 Further, powerful though the inference that their Honours identified in Sydneywide may be, ' mere proof of the fact that a person has deliberately copied the name or get-up of a trade rival does not of itself establish a contravention of s 52 or a passing off of goods or services ' ( Apand at 496). The Court must still be satisfied that the consequence is a likelihood of deception or a passing off of one product for another.</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719</tocase>
<text>30 Dayals criticises the absence of expert evidence concerning the reputation of Natural Waters or Fiji Water and, in particular, the absence of survey evidence as to the reputation in, and public recognition of, the "constellation of features" relied upon by Natural Waters. There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area. Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water. Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11] [12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons. As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant's packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced ( Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed). The evidence ruled inadmissible in Cadbury seemed to concern the likelihood of deception rather than reputation (at [5]) and evidence of consumer recognition, in the form of a "chocolate sensory study" was admitted ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [69]).</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 851</tocase>
<text>46 The fact that Natural Waters may establish reputation in the Fiji Water get-up does not mean that it has a monopoly over each aspect of that get-up. The goods are ordinary articles of consumption. By their nature, goods of different manufacturers will bear some resemblance to each other. Water is sold in bottles, frequently in transparent bottles and commonly with blue caps. The marks, brands and labels play an important part in distinguishing the goods of one manufacturer from those of another ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 200 per Gibbs CJ). Whether the reason for the distinctiveness of Fiji Water is one or more particular aspects of its packaging or the totality of its get-up, the offending product will only mislead or deceive consumers where it has taken the distinctive aspect(s) or so much of the totality of the get-up that the overall impression or the "gestalt" of the Fiji Water brand ([38] above) is adopted. If Dayals adopted an aspect of the get-up for its product, that fact alone does not dictate a finding of passing off ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 851 at 867; Cadbury (No 4) at [83]).

57 Natural Waters relies on the reputation of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups.

<tocase>Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The parties agree that the principles in Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 apply in ascertaining whether there has been misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Act or the Fair Trading Act . The subject matter of this litigation is bottled water. The conduct is tested as against the ordinary or reasonable member of the class of prospective purchasers of this product ( Campomar at [103]). A potential purchaser does not come to a decision with the benefit of argument as to the similarities and differences between two get-ups but is likely to make his or her decision in a relatively short period of time and in conditions which may vary ( Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [133]).

44 Section 52 and its equivalent provision in the Fair Trading Act provide wider protection from deception ( Campomar at [97]) but neither party has sought to rely on the distinction between the elements necessary to establish a contravention of s 52 and those to establish passing off. The question is what Island Chill would convey to a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable member of the class constituted by prospective purchasers of bottled water and whether that person would be mislead or deceived, or be likely to be misled or deceived, to conclude that Island Chill had sponsorship, association, approval or connection with Fiji Water or Natural Waters that it does not have ( Campomar at [102] [105]).</text>

<text>59 The reputation which must be proved in a case such as this is that the get-up, packaging, shape, or trade dress relied upon is associated by consumers with the applicant's product. It takes a strong case to establish a reputation of this nature ( Interlego at 386) as consumers will not necessarily associate a get-up with the applicant's product ( Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1398 at [33] to [34] per Lindgren J). The requisite reputation will more readily be found where the get-up is unique or striking rather than descriptive, mundane, merely functional, or in common use.</text>

<tocase>Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992) 39 FCR 348</tocase>
<text>30 Dayals criticises the absence of expert evidence concerning the reputation of Natural Waters or Fiji Water and, in particular, the absence of survey evidence as to the reputation in, and public recognition of, the "constellation of features" relied upon by Natural Waters. There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area. Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water. Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11] [12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons. As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant's packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced ( Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed). The evidence ruled inadmissible in Cadbury seemed to concern the likelihood of deception rather than reputation (at [5]) and evidence of consumer recognition, in the form of a "chocolate sensory study" was admitted ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [69]).

31 The determination of passing off and of contravention of the Act and the Fair Trading Act is assessed as a matter of impression based on recollection of the Fiji Water get-up and the Island Chill get-up. Whether a get-up so nearly resembles another as to be deceptive or likely to deceive is a question for the Court ( Interlego at 387). The packaging must be viewed as a whole ( Sterling Winthrop Pty Limited v R &amp; C Products Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41,308 at 42,126). It is not a question of comparing the bottles side by side and engaging in a minute and detailed analysis of the similarities and differences. The observations of Windeyer J in The Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 415 as to the assessment of deceptive similarity in a trade mark context are apposite. The goods in question are inexpensive consumer goods: bottled water, where the item is purchased for a relatively small price without long consideration and where the consumer is unlikely to engage in lengthy or detailed comparison of the respective get-ups ( Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 152 at 161). A consumer choosing between bottles of water on display would be likely to base the choice of purchase of his or her favoured bottled water product largely on recognition of the packaging.

59 The reputation which must be proved in a case such as this is that the get-up, packaging, shape, or trade dress relied upon is associated by consumers with the applicant's product. It takes a strong case to establish a reputation of this nature ( Interlego at 386) as consumers will not necessarily associate a get-up with the applicant's product ( Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1398 at [33] to [34] per Lindgren J).

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>71 The evidence of the design evolution of the Island Chill get-up was addressed in detail during the cross-examination of Mr Dayal. There is little direct documentary evidence of the way in which that evolution took place. Natural Waters draws attention to the lack of evidence of instructions to the designers, including evidence as to the use or otherwise to be made of the 2003 get-up of which Mr Dayal was aware and the absence of email communication over the relevant time between Mr Dayal and the designers. Particular criticism is made of the absence of additional witnesses and of the adequacy of Dayals' discovery. In these circumstances, Natural Waters submits that the inference should be drawn that none of this evidence would have assisted Dayals' case ( Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298).

72 Mr Dayal's evidence is that he was responsible for the get-up of Island Chill. While I accept that others made suggestions, the responsibility to "sign-off" on the get-up was his. I accept his evidence as to the events which occurred. No application for further and better discovery was made and I do not accept that Dayals failed to discover all relevant documents in their possession or failed to comply with their obligations of discovery.

73 Natural Waters and Dayals promote their products on the internet. Natural Waters invites the Court to draw inferences from the similarities between Island Chill's website (www.islandchill.com) and the Fiji Water website (www.fijiwater.com).</text>

<tocase>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1</tocase>
<text>45 Whether Dayals is passing off its goods as those of Natural Waters depends on the reputation attached to Fiji Water's identifying get-up so that it is distinctive of bottled water sold by Natural Waters; a representation by Dayals leading or likely to lead consumers to believe that Island Chill is the product of Natural Waters; and actual or probable damage ( Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 per Lord Oliver; TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc (1999) 45 IPR 43 at [25]; Sydneywide at [60]).

<tocase>Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd v Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd (2001) 53 IPR 481</tocase>
<text>39 The primary judge concluded that Sydneywide had intentionally adopted the Red Bull get-up for its packaging for the purpose of appropriating part of its trade or reputation and that it had selected a get-up which would "sail as close to the wind" as it thought expedient ( Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd v Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd (2001) 53 IPR 481 at [47]). That finding formed an important basis for his Honour's conclusion that there was passing off and breach of s 52 of the Act as it led to the finding that there was scope for a purchaser to believe that both products emanated from the same "manufacturing stable", especially where the different brand names were not readily discernible ( Red Bull at [69], cited in Sydneywide at [47]).

40 Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, with whom Branson J agreed discussed, at [55] and following, the elements of passing off and the relevance of the intent of the party accused. Their Honours concluded (at [62]) that there is no requirement that there be an actual, subjective intention to mislead; the misrepresentation need only be likely to lead the public to believe that the goods are those of the applicant.

41 There were differences in the get-up and the brand name. The relevance of the differences depended on the opportunity which a potential purchaser would have to observe those distinctions (at [72]). The parties adduced expert evidence before the primary judge of the likely behaviour of shoppers or consumers with respect to the products there in dispute. The evidence, as well as "experience and common sense", suggested that relatively little attention would be given to the choice of a particular item for removal from the refrigerator for purchase (at [74]).

42 Weinberg and Dowsett JJ considered at [107] the difference between and prominence of the brand names. The brand names were said to have similar associated connotations. Their Honours said that, where the purchaser may have in mind the connotations of the name rather than the name itself, such similarities may tend to undermine what might otherwise be a basis for clear distinction. Similar colour combinations and the diagonal thrust of design, notwithstanding the fact that other minor players in the market traded under similar colours, affected the Court's conclusion that there was a capacity to deceive.

43 Natural Waters' case as pleaded against Artesian Waters alleges contraventions of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Act and passing off. A separate case for s 53(c) and (d) was not pursued in submissions. It is alleged against Mr Dayal and Mr Pranesh Dayal that they have:
 
 &#8226; been knowingly concerned, within the meaning of s 75B of the Act, in the alleged contraventions of the Act by Artesian Waters;
 &#8226; contravened the equivalent provisions of the Fair Trading Act (ss 42, 44(e) and 44(f)); and
 &#8226; engaged in passing off as joint tortfeasors with Artesian Waters.</text>

<tocase>Remy Martin v Carlton Wines &amp; Spirits (Aust) Pty Ltd (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 19 February 1992)</tocase>
<text>35 Natural Waters placed reliance on two cases: Remy Martin v Carlton Wines &amp; Spirits (Aust) Pty Ltd (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 19 February 1992) and Sydneywide .

36 In Remy Martin , the comparison was between "Liquore Galliano" and "Valentino". Justice O'Loughlin found that "Liquore Galliano" was a product that ' virtually "owns" its niche within the liqueur market...it is thereby unique and ... its unchanged labelling and get-up have become distinctive and synonymous (sic) with its uniqueness ' (at [106]). The accused bottles were very different in shape and it was said to be "impossible" for any person to confuse them. The names were also different: "Galliano" and "Valentino", with the latter name prominently displayed. There were less important differences on the rear labels and in the writing on the front label. The respondents denied copying but said that the goal was to obtain "a similar feel" to the Galliano label. For example, a fort appeared on the Galliano label; a castle motif was adopted by Valentino. The defence was that the castle was chosen not to suggest an association with Galliano but because of its Italian or European association.

37 Justice O'Loughlin concluded that the respondents, former franchisees of Galliano products, set about to "filch" as much of the Galliano label and get-up as they thought would be safe to withstand legal challenge (at [114]). His Honour found that the choice of a castle was an attempt to attract the eye of the intending purchaser in the hope that he or she would mistake the product for the Galliano range (at [115]). It ' destroyed the bona fides of the respondents' case ' (at [116]). A reference to a cocktail associated with Galliano also achieved a ' marked degree of importance ' (at [117]). Justice O'Loughlin concluded that, standing back and avoiding minutiae, there was ' an overwhelming sense of association as if the proprietors of "Liquore Galliano" might have decided to market their product in a different bottle with a different name '.

38 In Sydneywide , two competing energy drink products, "Red Bull" and "LiveWire", were packaged in cans of similar size and colour. The cans each had a "strong diagonal thrust" in their design. There were significant differences, including the brand names and the forms of writing on the cans. There was emphasis, by an expert witness at trial, on what was described as the "gestalt" of the brand, in the sense of '[a] n integrated perceptual structure or unity conceived, as functionally more than the sum of its parts ', which was said to be ' almost identical ' (at [41] and [91]).

81 Mr Dayal readily conceded that he wished to take advantage of a growing world market demand for bottled water. Mr Dayal is Fijian and the family businesses are based in Fiji. He appreciated that Fiji was a good source from which to meet such a demand and he had the opportunity and business experience to develop that market. Unlike O'Loughlin J in Remy Martin , I am not satisfied that Mr Dayal had the intention to market a bottled water product that would be associated with Fiji Water. He was aware of the need to "distance" his product from Fiji Water, not least for legal reasons. I accept Mr Dayal's evidence of his intentions and of the process of design of Island Chill, for which he was responsible at the decision-making level.

82 I am firmly of the view that the ordinary or reasonable consumer of bottled water would not confuse Fiji Water and Island Chill or be misled, or be likely to be misled, into believing that they were in any way associated, other than both being a product of Fiji. This is so whether the consumer paused to consider the bottles or made the choice with only a "transitory" glance. Natural Waters emphasises the distinctive aspects of the Fiji Water get-up. Two of the most distinctive are the square shaped bottle and the name "FIJI" in capital letters, in white, outlined by gold. Island Chill is in a bottle with an elongated shape, totally different although square faced, from the distinctive shape of the Fiji Water bottle. The name Island Chill is prominent and appears totally different in script, colour, name and style to the "FIJI" of Fiji Water. Those aspects alone are, in my opinion, sufficient clearly to differentiate the two products.

83 The blue cap, transparent label, three-dimensional background, tropical flower motif and colour and nature of the three-dimensional background are not displayed only on bottles of Fiji Water. They have been utilised in Australia by other manufacturers of bottled water. They do, however, form part of the overall impression or effect of Fiji Water, although there are differences between the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up. In each case, the use made of these devices by Island Chill is different. The blue cap is of a different colour; the single hibiscus is different to the 2003 get-up and of a different colour and position to the 2005 get-up; the three-dimensional scene is different and of a different predominant colour to each of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups. Importantly, the overall effect of the combination of each aspect of the design is different and sufficiently so to differentiate Island Chill from the 2003 get-up and the 2005 get-up. Unlike Sydneywide , there is no "gestalt" common to Island Chill and Fiji Water. The products simply look different. The ordinary consumer would not be misled or deceived into believing that they were from the same manufacturer or in some way commercially associated. The ordinary consumer would not believe that Island Chill was the product of Natural Waters or associated with Natural Waters or Fiji Water or was a bottle of Fiji Water.</text>

<tocase>Sterling Winthrop Pty Limited v R &amp; C Products Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41,308</tocase>
<text>31 The determination of passing off and of contravention of the Act and the Fair Trading Act is assessed as a matter of impression based on recollection of the Fiji Water get-up and the Island Chill get-up. Whether a get-up so nearly resembles another as to be deceptive or likely to deceive is a question for the Court ( Interlego at 387). The packaging must be viewed as a whole ( Sterling Winthrop Pty Limited v R &amp; C Products Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41,308 at 42,126). It is not a question of comparing the bottles side by side and engaging in a minute and detailed analysis of the similarities and differences. The observations of Windeyer J in The Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 415 as to the assessment of deceptive similarity in a trade mark context are apposite. The goods in question are inexpensive consumer goods: bottled water, where the item is purchased for a relatively small price without long consideration and where the consumer is unlikely to engage in lengthy or detailed comparison of the respective get-ups ( Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 152 at 161). A consumer choosing between bottles of water on display would be likely to base the choice of purchase of his or her favoured bottled water product largely on recognition of the packaging.</text>

<tocase>Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354</tocase>
<text>28 The parties agree that the principles in Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 apply in ascertaining whether there has been misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Act or the Fair Trading Act . The subject matter of this litigation is bottled water. The conduct is tested as against the ordinary or reasonable member of the class of prospective purchasers of this product ( Campomar at [103]). A potential purchaser does not come to a decision with the benefit of argument as to the similarities and differences between two get-ups but is likely to make his or her decision in a relatively short period of time and in conditions which may vary ( Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [133]).</text>

<tocase>TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc (1999) 45 IPR 43</tocase>
<text>45 Whether Dayals is passing off its goods as those of Natural Waters depends on the reputation attached to Fiji Water's identifying get-up so that it is distinctive of bottled water sold by Natural Waters; a representation by Dayals leading or likely to lead consumers to believe that Island Chill is the product of Natural Waters; and actual or probable damage ( Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 per Lord Oliver; TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc (1999) 45 IPR 43 at [25]; Sydneywide at [60]). Where a get-up of a product is distinctive of that product and its trade source, there may be passing off and contravention of the Act and the Fair Trading Act even though the products bear different brands or labels.</text>
