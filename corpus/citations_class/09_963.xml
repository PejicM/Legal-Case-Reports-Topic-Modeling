<tocase>H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 118 FCR 153</tocase>
<text>In support of the contention that a subsequent notification cancels the effect of an earlier one, the respondent relied on H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 118 FCR 153. There notification had first been sent to the appellant's agent and was later handed to the appellant in person. Notification to the agent gave the appellant more time in which to lodge his application for review. The Refugee Review Tribunal dismissed the application on the ground that it was out of time. The primary judge dismissed an appeal from that decision. The appellant's appeal was upheld by the Full Court. The Court agreed with the Tribunal's decision so far as it concerned personal notification, but said that the Tribunal had overlooked the notification to the agent. At [9] their Honours said: 
 On the basis of this notification, there are two alternative bases for concluding that the application for review was within time. The first is that the notification to the migration agent was the only relevant notification of the decision, so that the application for review could be lodged at any time before 14 November. This approach assumes that once the Minister first notified the appellant of the decision, that exhausted the Minister's obligation under s 66. If that be correct, any further "notifications" (for example, by personally serving the appellant with a copy of the decision), would not be notifications under the statute and would have no legal consequence. 

 
 The second basis for holding the application to be within time assumes that the second notification cannot be ignored, and that it brought into operation a second timetable within which the applicant could file a notice of review. In that event the applicant has been given two inconsistent timetables within which to make application for review and, in the absence of any statutory basis for giving one priority over the other, the appellant was entitled to choose the timetable that best suited him. That is what occurred in this case, albeit the appellant did not know he was making a choice.

In Zhang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 151 ; (2007) 161 FCR 419 the appellant relied on the second basis in H , which the Full Court described at [23] as an "ambitious claim". At [25] their Honours said it was unnecessary to express any view on the correctness or otherwise of the second basis in H and in particular "whether there can be two operative and effective notifications made". They were of the opinion that in the case before them two methods of notification were not utilised giving rise to inconsistent timetables.

In my view the Full Court in H was not endorsing both alternative bases. Only one can be the correct approach. An assumption is part of each of them. I understand the Court to have said that on whichever of the two bases argued was the correct one, the application for review was within time. It was thus unnecessary to decide which was the true view. For the reasons I have given, the first basis is to be preferred. That would appear to have been the opinion of the Court in Zhang .</text>

<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>The Minister's notice of appeal should have been filed and served by 27 March 2009. It was filed and served six days late. Order 52 rule 15(2) empowers the Court to extend time for "special reasons". In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 the Full Court said that "special reasons": 
 is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served.

In my view the Minister has sufficiently explained the short delay in filing the notice of appeal. In several cases an extension of time has been granted where there has been a short delay caused by reliance on incorrect advice as to time limits. Jess v Scott was such a case. Prospects of success

Section 494B of the Act provides in part: 
 (1) For the purposes of provisions of this Act or the regulations that: 

(a) require or permit the Minister to give a document to a person (the recipient ); and
 
(b) state that the Minister must do so by one of the methods specified in this section;
 
the methods are as follows.
 
 ...
 (4) Another method consists of the Minister dating the document, and then dispatching it: 

(a) within 3 working days (in the place of dispatch) of the date of the document; and
 
(b) by prepaid post or by other prepaid means; and
 
(c) to:
 
(i) the last address for service provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents; or
 
(ii) the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents.

Regulation 2.16(3) of the Regulations requires the Minister to notify an applicant of a decision to refuse to grant a visa by one of the methods in s 494B.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bahwadj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/11.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondent submits that the Act does not prevent the Minister notifying a decision on more than one occasion, either because there is doubt whether the duty imposed by s 66 had been discharged or because it is expedient to do so. It was said that Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bahwadj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 shows that where a person exercising statutory power realises a purported exercise is not legally effective, the person can re-exercise the power. In that case an applicant's agent informed the Immigration Review Tribunal that the applicant was unable to attend a hearing and wanted a later hearing date. By error that information was not drawn to the attention of the member constituting the Tribunal, who made a decision adverse to the applicant. On discovering the error, the Tribunal held a further hearing and decided in the applicant's favour. The Minister's application to set aside the second decision on the ground that the Tribunal was functus officio once it had made the first decision was dismissed. Four members of the Court held that the Tribunal's first decision was made in jurisdictional error (denial of natural justice), did not constitute a review as required by the Act, and was of no legal effect.

The present case is quite different. Here the Tribunal found, correctly, that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Once it had done that, it was functus officio. If it had purported to re-exercise its power, any "decision" would have been of no effect. The essence of Bahwadj is that the Tribunal's first decision was a nullity, and thus no obstacle to a fresh decision.

The respondent relied on s 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) for the contention that the requirement in s 66 of the Act that the Minister notify an applicant of the decision whether to grant or refuse a visa can be exercised from time to time. That subsection provides: 
 Where an Act confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as the occasion requires. 

 
As I understood it, this provision was deployed in support of the contention that a subsequent notification could displace an earlier one.

Section 33(1) was mentioned in Bahwadj . There the Minister argued that the subsection does not confer any power to make a further decision, because the Act disclosed an intention to the contrary. The High Court held that once it was seen that the first decision was a nullity, the Tribunal was required to revisit the matter because its duty remained unperformed. At [53] Gaudron and Gummow JJ said this was so "regardless of s 33(1) ". At [156] Hayne J said that s 33(1) did not require consideration because the Tribunal had performed its duty only once, by the making of the second decision.

Whatever the scope of s 33(1) , it cannot in my view operate in the way in which the respondent seeks to have it apply, namely to invalidate or cancel the legal effect of an earlier performance of a duty. The subsection says nothing about displacing the legal effect of an earlier exercise of power or performance of duty. That it does not have that effect is supported by the contrast provided by subs (3): 
 Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument (including rules, regulations or by-laws) the power shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as including a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like conditions (if any) to repeal, rescind, revoke, amend or vary any such instrument.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/181.html</AustLII>
<text>The observations of Hely J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Watson [2005] FCAFC 181 ; (2005) 145 FCR 542 at 547 are to the same effect: 
 In my view, s 33(1) ... (assuming it applies) does not have the effect that once there is a valid exercise of the s 501(2) power to cancel a visa, the visa can be effectively restored to the former holder by a second exercise of that power. Whilst the Minister has a discretion whether or not to exercise the s 501(2) power, the power in question is simply a power to cancel a visa which, if validly exercised, results in the former holder acquiring the status of an unlawful non-citizen with the consequences prescribed by the Act. There is no occasion for the re-exercise of the power once it has been validly exercised.</text>

<tocase>Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 38</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/38.html</AustLII>
<text>The main factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion are the applicant's prospects of success on an appeal, and whether a sufficient explanation for the delay has been provided: Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 38 at [20] and [27]. Explanation for delay

I will deal first with the explanation that has been provided for the delay. On 6 March 2009, the date of the Magistrate's decision, the Minister's solicitors advised him that the last day to file and serve a notice of appeal was 3 April 2009. According to the solicitor handling the matter, that date was calculated by reference to s 477A of the Act. Reliance on that section was misplaced, because the section applies to applications to the Court in its original jurisdiction and not its appellate jurisdiction. The Minister acted on that advice, and within the advised appeal period, on 1 April instructed his solicitors to file a notice of appeal. That was done on 2 April. As I have said, later that day the Registry informed the Minister's solicitors that the notice was out of time. The solicitors informed the Minister of that fact, and the Minister said he would consider his position and provide instructions by 6 April. On that day the Minister decided to seek an extension of time. That application was filed on 7 April together with a supporting affidavit setting out the matters recorded in this paragraph.</text>

<tocase>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1974/40.html</AustLII>
<text>As part of this first discretionary consideration, the respondent contended that the Minister made an election by not seeking a stay of the Magistrate's orders and indeed complying with them, and that he cannot resile from the consequences of that conduct. In Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634 at 655 Mason J said: 
 A person is said to have a right of election when events occur which enable him to exercise alternative and inconsistent rights.
 ...
 Essential to the making of an election is communication to the party affected by words or conduct of the choice thereby made and it is accepted that once an election is made it cannot be retracted ... 

 
 A person confronted with a choice between the exercise of alternative and inconsistent rights is not bound to elect at once. He may keep the question open, so long as he does not affirm the contract or continuance of the estate and so long as the delay does not cause prejudice to the other side.

Apart from saying that the Minister did not seek a stay of the Magistrate's order, the respondent did not identify the Minister's two alternative and inconsistent rights. Presumably the right other than the right to seek a stay is the right to appeal. In my view these rights are not inconsistent rights. Unsuccessful litigants frequently comply with orders which they intend to challenge without thereby losing their right of appeal. For example a litigant ordered to repay money to the Commonwealth is unlikely to be advised to seek a stay, because there would be no risk of the Commonwealth being unable to repay the money in the event of a successful appeal. The notion that the consequence of not applying for a stay and complying with an adverse order is the loss of the right to appeal is quite foreign to the way in which appellate litigation is conducted. That the right to apply for a stay and the right to appeal are not inconsistent is shown by the fact that they so often travel together. For example, an unsuccessful party who is ordered to pay money to an opponent he thinks will use it to pay heavy debts so as to make it unlikely he will be able to repay it if the appeal is successful, will both appeal and seek a stay.

The second discretionary consideration relied on by the respondent is that the legal issues the Minister wishes to raise on an appeal are of academic interest. She relies on s 494C(7) of the Act which provides: 
 If: 

 
 (a) the Minister purports to give a document to a person in accordance with a method specified in section 494B ... but makes an error in doing so; and
 (b) the person nonetheless receives the document or a copy of it; 

 
 then the person is taken to have received the document at the times mentioned in this section as if the Minister had given the document to the person without making an error in doing so, unless the person can show that he or she received it at a later time, in which case, the person is taken to have received it at that time.</text>

<tocase>Sloane v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 37 FCR 626</tocase>
<text>In Sloane v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 37 FCR 626 the Minister refused to grant a temporary entry permit. Later the applicant asked that the refusal be reviewed in the light of additional material. That request was refused. The applicant sought judicial review of both refusals. The ground of review of present relevance concerned the second refusal, which was attacked on the ground that the decision maker erroneously concluded that he did not have power to reconsider his decision. French J considered whether the power to grant or refuse to grant an entry permit carried with it a power to reconsider an earlier exercise of the power. His Honour concluded it did not. He said at 444: 
 While it may be accepted that a power to reconsider a decision made in exercise of a statutory discretion will have the advantage of convenience, it cannot always claim the virtue of necessity. And in the context of the Migration Act as it presently stands with specific provisions for review of decisions and the making of regulations relating thereto, I do not consider, in the absence of clear words, that it would be proper to imply such a power.</text>

<tocase>VOAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 397</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/397.html</AustLII>
<text>The Minister says that s 494C(4) would have operated to deem the first notification letter to have been received even if the respondent's notification of change of address had been received by the Department between 7 August 2007 (when the letter was sent) and 16 August 2007 (when it was deemed to have been received). In VOAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 397 at [22] French J said: 
 I do not accept the submission that the process of sending remains notionally in effect until deemed receipt and is halted by the intervening notice of a new address. Neither the language nor the evident purpose of the statutory and regulatory scheme supports such a construction.

Of course in the present case, on the Minister's submission, s 494C(4) had fully operated on the first notification letter before the respondent notified her change of address.

In my view the Minister has a strong case that once the Federal Magistrate had rejected the technical attacks on the validity of the first notification letter, he should have concluded that the respondent had been notified of the delegate's decision on the ground that the defect in the second notification letter cannot affect the validity of a notification that had already been "taken" or "deemed" to have occurred prior to the second notification letter being sent. Discretionary considerations

The respondent advanced three matters she said should lead to the refusal of an extension of time. The first was that an appeal is of academic interest only, and will not determine any question now at issue between the parties. The respondent has a review proceeding on foot in the Tribunal in respect of the delegate's decision. That review will determine whether she is entitled to the visa. It was submitted that if an extension of time were granted and the appeal upheld, that would not affect the conduct of the review or the validity of the Tribunal's decision on the review. The position would be the same if the appeal were to be dismissed.

The contention that the respondent's application for review will determine her right to a visa is in my view much weaker than the Minister's strong case described at [26]. On that case, the third notification letter was incapable of having any effect because the first notification letter was effective. Accordingly the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to entertain the application. Section 347(1) requires an application for review to be made in the approved form and be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period. The prescribed period in reg 4(10)(1)(a) is 21 days after the notification of the decision. Notification took place on 16 August 2007. The current application was not made within the prescribed period, and accordingly is not competent. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain it. The Department's letter of 24 March 2009 cannot confer on the Tribunal jurisdiction it does not have. The respondent's discretionary consideration depends on the Minister's contention, just described, being erroneous. All I need say at this stage is that in view of the strength of the Minister's case, I do not regard this discretionary consideration, which is at odds with that strong case, to be sufficiently persuasive to cause me to refuse an extension of time.

French J did not refer to s 33(1). However, in Burgess v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 926 ; (2000) 101 FCR 58 at 62 Katz J expressed the view that his Honour would have come to the same conclusion had he taken that provision into account.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/172.html</AustLII>
<text>In Xie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 172 at [13] - [14] the Full Court said: 
 Subsection 494C(4) does not purport to create a rebuttable presumption of fact. It provides that in certain circumstances, a person is to be "taken to have received the document ...". Nothing in the section suggests that this is merely a rebuttable presumption... 

 
 Spender J, in Murphy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 657 ; (2004) 135 FCR 550 at [69] observed: 

 
The person is "taken to have received the document", in the circumstances of this case, seven working days after the date of the document. In my view this provision manifests an intention that a person is taken to have received the document seven working days after the date of the document, without qualification. There is nothing to indicate that the effect of the subsection is to be read as if there was a proviso that the person was not taken to have received the document where the document had been returned undelivered to the sender within seven working days after the date of the document, or that the subsection operates in its terms only "until the contrary is proved".
 
 
 We agree. The sequence of statutory and regulatory provisions to which we have referred prescribes with precision the steps to be taken in notifying a visa applicant of the outcome of his or her application.</text>

<text>In Zhang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 151 ; (2007) 161 FCR 419 the appellant relied on the second basis in H , which the Full Court described at [23] as an "ambitious claim".

In my view the Full Court in H was not endorsing both alternative bases. Only one can be the correct approach. An assumption is part of each of them.
