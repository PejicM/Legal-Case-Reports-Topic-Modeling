<tocase>Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1</tocase>

<text>8 There is a question as to whether leave should be granted to amend the notice of appeal. As was observed by the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , at page 7: 
 
 "To say that an appeal is by way of re-hearing does not mean that the issues and the evidence to be considered are at large. It is fundamental to the due administration of justice, that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. "

9 To permit these amendments to the notice of appeal would have about it, in my opinion, a tendency to reduce the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court to "little more than a preliminary skirmish".

10 If it were the case that on examination, a ground of additional challenge had about it, even arguably, the likelihood that the proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal had completely miscarried at law, then of course the amendment of a notice of appeal would be readily granted. I do not see that any of the bases additionally advanced in the Applicant's submissions, have about them that quality in the circumstances of this particular case. I therefore do not propose, insofar as one might infer a request to amend the notice of appeal from the way in which the written submission has been cast, to allow such amendment. Instead I propose to consider, in more detail, the merits of the grounds of appeal as identified in the notice of appeal.</text>

<tocase>Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437</tocase>
<text>12 Ground 4 is more particular. It alleges that the Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down by a Full Court in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. That case deals with the application of what is known as the "Internal Protection Principle". More particularly, it addresses whether a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution in one region of his or her country of nationality can nonetheless reasonably avail himself or herself of protection within another region of that country. On behalf of the Minister it has been submitted that the principles discussed in that case only arise where there has been a finding that the protection visa applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution.

13 If there is no finding of a well-founded fear of persecution, questions of relocation and of the application of an internal protection principle do not arise. The Appellant's difficulty in this case in relation to ground 4 is that there is a finding by the Tribunal that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. In turn, that finding of the Tribunal is a finding that seems, to me, to be one that was reasonably open to the Tribunal to make. That seems to have been the view of the Federal Magistrate and I see no error in that view. In the absence of that foundation, ground 4 must necessarily fail.

14 Ground 5 is in these terms:
 
 The Federal Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the tribunal decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim.

15 My reading of the Federal Magistrate's decision is that the Magistrate considered in detail the approach that the Tribunal had taken to the appellant's claim for a protection visa. The conclusion reached by the Federal Magistrate was that the Tribunal did consider the appellant's situation in relation to the claim he advanced for a protection visa. The Magistrate correctly apprehended that the Tribunal had accepted some aspects of the Appellant's claims and rejected others on the basis of credibility. The Magistrate noted that the Tribunal accepted that the Appellant had been subject to physical harassment in 2003. As was appropriate, though, the Magistrate conceded to the Tribunal the role of making value judgments on the merits.

16 It is apparent to me that the merits of the Appellant's claim for a protection visa were considered by the Refugee Review Tribunal. So much was also apparent to the Federal Magistrate. I see no error in the Magistrate's conclusion that the Tribunal had dealt with the Appellant's claim for protection visa on the merits. It is important for the courts, in exercising a judicial review and even more so an appellate jurisdiction, to adopt a principled restraint in the interference with value judgments by administrative tribunals on factual matters. Ground 5 necessarily fails.</text>
