<tocase>Re Bilen; Ex Parte Sistrom [1985] FCA 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1985/141.html</AustLII>
<text>7 By an application filed 16 November 2005 in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the Federal Magistrates Court') the respondent sought relief pursuant to s 30(1)(b) of the Act in respect of the realisation of the property and the disposition of the proceeds of any sale. In Re Bilen; Ex Parte Sistrom [1985] FCA 141 Neaves J at [8] said in relation to an application by the trustee of a bankrupt seeking declarations as to the beneficial ownership of land registered in the names of a bankrupt and his wife as joint tenants and in respect of the disposition of the bankrupt's undivided half share:
 
 'In my opinion s 30(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 is not a provision limiting the Court's jurisdiction. It is a facultative provision giving the Court full power, within the limits of its jurisdiction to be found elsewhere, to make such orders as it considers should be made in order to carry out and give effect to the Act. The words used are not words of limitation but of extension.'

8 Later his Honour said at [17]:
 
 '... this Court is not restricted in considering what orders it would be appropriate to make in exercise of the power conferred on it by s 30(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 by the kinds of limitations which may be found in the Partition Act, 1900 (NSW)' [see also s 66G of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)]

9 The respondent's application came before the learned Federal Magistrate on 6 December 2005, 17 January and 16 February 2006.

10 On 6 December 2005 the Federal Magistrate ordered the appellant to file and serve a Notice of Appearance by 7 December 2005, but this did not occur. However, at about 4.01 pm on 7 December 2005 Mr Thanh Tung Vo, a solicitor in the firm known as Australasia Legal &amp; Migration Services, Solicitors attempted to file a Notice of Appearance dated 7 December 2005 by forwarding same by facsimile to facsimile number 9230 8535, which he believed to be the facsimile number for the Federal Magistrates Court. Whether this Notice of Appearance reached the Court or not is uncertain. It certainly did not reach the relevant Federal Magistrates Court file number SYG 3351 of 2005. The Federal Magistrate also ordered that the Respondent file and serve 'a Notice in accordance with Form 149 stating grounds of opposition and affidavit supporting grounds of opposition' by 22 December 2005. Once again, this did not occur.

11 Whilst a notice in accordance with Form 149 stating the appellant's grounds of opposition to the trustee's application was never filed, an attempt was made to prepare an affidavit for the appellant propounding that she had contributed $37,000 out of a total purchase price of $67,000 paid for the property, that the balance had been funded by an advance from Commonwealth Bank of Australia to the appellant and the bankrupt and that she had paid all the monies due under the mortgage. Page 1 of the affidavit suggests that it was sworn on 15 December 2005. This is patently incorrect, but I am satisfied that no deception of the Federal Magistrates Court was intended. Each of the annexure notes in respect of annexures 'A', 'B' and 'C' to the affidavit indicate that it was in fact sworn on 15 February 2006. Mr Vo's evidence is that he was responsible for the insertion of the date 15 December 2005 which was the date when he set about drafting the affidavit. Due to inadvertence on his behalf he failed to cause the correct date to be inserted on page 1 of the affidavit when it came to be sworn on 15 February 2006 in its final form. No attempt was ever made by the appellant to file the affidavit and it was never read. However, on 16 February 2006 it was handed up to the Federal Magistrate. It was not formally tendered but it seems clear to me that it was intended by Mr Vo that it should become an exhibit on the hearing of an application made by him orally on that day to which reference will be made hereafter. The affidavit included the following:
 
 
 '3. Although my husband and I were registered as proprietors of the Property as joint tenants, I in fact paid all the monies as necessary to purchase the Property in our joint names together with the monies advanced by the original mortgagee, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). 
 ... 
 6. Annexed and marked "B" is a copy of another payment made by me to my conveyancing solicitor, although the receipt was in joint names. 
 
 7. I made the mortgage payment from my monies solely. 
 
 8. My husband did not contribute any to the purchase or the mortgage repayment at any time. 
 ... 
 13. I having made an informed decision, I oppose the sale of the Property which, is in fact mine and which is the only home of myself, my husband and my three children.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/7.html</AustLII>
<text>40 The usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties. The test requires the appellate court to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. Accordingly, orders refusing to set aside a default judgment or refusing to grant an extension of time are not final judgments because the unsuccessful party could make a further application for the same relief, even though such an application might have very little prospect of success (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 230 [25] ; see also per McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at 2 [4] ).</text>

<tocase>Shocked v Goldschmidt [1998] 1 All ER 372</tocase>
<text>44 The relevant principles in relation to the setting aside of orders made in a party's absence have been conveniently summarised in the judgment of Leggatt LJ in Shocked v Goldschmidt [1998] 1 All ER 372 at 381 as follows:
 
 '... (1) Where a party with notice of proceedings has disregarded the opportunity of appearing at and participating in the trial, he will normally be bound by the decision. (2) Where judgment has been given after a trial it is the explanation for the absence of the absent party that is most important: unless the absence was not deliberate but was due to accident or mistake, the court will be unlikely to allow a rehearing. (3) Where the setting aside of judgment would entail a complete retrial on matters of fact which have already been investigated by the court the application will not be granted unless there are very strong reasons for doing so. (4) The court will not consider setting aside judgment regularly obtained unless the party applying enjoys real prospects of success. (5) Delay in applying to set aside is relevant, particularly if during the period of delay the successful party has acted on the judgment, or third parties have acquired rights by reference to it. (6) In considering justice between parties, the conduct of the person applying to set aside the judgment has to be considered: where he has failed to comply with orders of the court, the court will be less ready to exercise its discretion in his favour. (7) A material consideration is whether the successful party would be prejudiced by the judgment being set aside, especially if he cannot be protected against the financial consequences. (8) There is a public interest in there being an end to litigation and in not having the time of the court occupied by two trials, particularly if neither is short.' 


 
Roch and Morritt LJJ agreed with the reasons for judgment of Leggatt LJ.

45 It seems clear that the appellant did not relevantly disregard the opportunity to appear at and participate in the hearing listed for 9.30 am on 16 February 2006. The arrival of Mr Vo, albeit late, suggests that the appellant's absence was anything but deliberate. It does not appear that there was an extensive trial before the Federal Magistrate on 16 February 2006 before Mr Vo arrived. There was plainly no relevant delay on the part of the appellant in seeking to set aside the orders made earlier in the day on 16 February 2006 and there would appear to be no real prejudice to the respondent if the orders made earlier in the day on 16 February 2006 were to be set aside. The conduct of the appellant in failing to comply with orders of the Federal Magistrate in relation to the provision of particulars of her grounds of opposition to the trustee's application and the filing of affidavits warrants criticism, but does not, in my view, compel a conclusion that the application to set aside the earlier orders should have been refused. It is but one of the matters to which the Federal Magistrate was entitled to have and should have had regard in the exercise of his discretion.

46 The substantial consideration, in the circumstances of this case, seems to me to be whether the appellant would enjoy 'real prospects of success' were the orders made in her absence on 16 February 2006 to be set aside.

47 Whilst the Federal Magistrate appears to have conducted something of a mini trial by reference to the appellant's affidavit of '15 December 2005' and the corroborative documents upon which she sought to rely being annexures 'A', 'B' and 'C' to that affidavit, the fact remains that notwithstanding the Federal Magistrate's findings in respect of the corroborative evidence, her untested evidence as recorded in the affidavit was, as the Federal Magistrate found, to suggest that she had 'advanced $37,000 of the $67,000 purchase price, the balance being a mortgage to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which she says she made all the payments for'.</text>
