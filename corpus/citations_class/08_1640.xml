<text>16 Contrary to Telstra's submission, the authorities show that where there has been an invalid exercise of an administrative power, including on the ground of jurisdictional error, the Court will consider whether it is appropriate to find a severable valid exercise of power: cf Biyiksiz v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 352 at 12; Re Australian Industrial Relations Commission; Ex parte Smith [2004] FCAFC 271 at [85] - [88] ; Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 ; (2008) 166 FCR 91 at [97] - [107] .</text>

<text>12 In oral submissions, senior counsel for Telstra directed this first argument mainly to Telstra's ground 10(c) which was that ACCC fell into jurisdictional error. Telstra submits that at common law the inevitable result of its success in relation to cl 5A(i) is that the entire Final Determination is a nullity.

<text>23 At common law, a provision is severable if it is a straightforward matter to isolate it from the remaining provisions and the remaining provisions are not affected in their meaning and operation by severing the invalid part: cf Harrington v Lowe (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 327-8; Evans v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 at [61] [62]. The common law test is satisfied in the present case.

24 Section 46 of the AI Act (set out at [5] above) requires severance, because the structure and effect of the Final Determination clearly expose "the extent" to which the Final Determination is and the extent to which it is not in excess of power: cf Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner [1995] HCA 16 ; (1995) 183 CLR 323 at 347-348 per Dawson J; Evans v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 at [63] [65].</text>

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) (2007) 99 ALD 268</tocase>
<text>26 Telstra relies on the decision of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) (2007) 99 ALD 268 ( Telstra v ACCC (No 3) ). That case concerned a Pt A competition notice issued by ACCC under s 151AKA of the Act. Section 151AKA(10) provided, relevantly, that ACCC must not issue such a notice unless it had first given the addressee carrier or carriage service provider a written notice inviting it to make a submission to ACCC on the proposal to issue the Pt A competition notice.

28 In Telstra v ACCC (No 3) , ACCC sought leave to argue that there should be a severance of the respective parts of the Pt A competition notice pursuant to s 46 of the AI Act so as to preserve the validity of those parts which had been notified in the notice of invitation. Her Honour held (at [83] [91]) that there could not be a severance. She held that s 46 had no application to a decision made under an Act as distinct from an instrument (at [55]) and also distinguished between questions of severance involving an "excess of power" and a lack of power to make an entire instrument (at [57]).

29 It suffices to say that s 151AKA(10) was a prohibition on the issuing of a Pt A competition notice unless ACCC had first taken the steps mandated by s 151AKA(10)(a).

30 The statutory provisions in the present case are different. Section 152CR(1) required ACCC to take specified matters into account in making a decision, namely, a final determination, and s 152AQA required ACCC to have regard to any determination of principles relating to the price of access to a declared service if it was required to arbitrate (make a decision upon) an access dispute under Div 8 in relation to that service.</text>
