<tocase>Beecham Group PLC v Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 273</tocase>
<text>10 Whether an award for costs is apportioned between the parties is a matter for judicial discretion: s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In the ordinary course of litigation costs follow the event; that is, unless special circumstances exist to order otherwise, the successful party should be reimbursed its costs of the litigation: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 48-134 at 48-136; Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 271; Beecham Group PLC v Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 273 at 274; TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Network Ten Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCAFC 194 at [2] .</text>

<tocase>Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4</tocase>
<text>12 When apportioning costs, however, a Court should be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order: Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 12. Equally, litigants should not be rewarded for the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance.

13 In this case, I consider it appropriate to apportion the costs to some extent. Having regard to the authorities and the submissions of the parties summarised above at [5]-[9], I find that it is appropriate to reduce the costs award by 10%.

14 Accordingly, the order is that the respondents pay 90% of the costs of the applicant in these proceedings. I direct the parties to liaise with my associate to arrange further directions in the matter after Austal's application for leave to appeal or, if leave is granted, Austal's appeal from the orders made on 20 July 2007, is determined.
 I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.
