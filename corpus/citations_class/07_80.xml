<text>22 Counsel for the applicant referred to Hoffman v Chief of Army [2004] FCAFC 148 ; (2004) 137 FCR 520. In fact, the submission was based on the approach to statutory construction summarised by Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia [1932] HCA 9 ; (1932) 47 CLR 1 (at 7) as follows:
 
 'When the Legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must be observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same power.'</text>

<text>26 As to the second submission, the High Court has held that s 501(2) is a valid law with respect to aliens: Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 72 ; (2003) 218 CLR 28. In Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 the Full Court of this Court held, after it had identified the relevant considerations to the exercise of the power in s 501(2), that the section did not infringe or contravene Chapter III of the Constitution . I will not repeat what I said in Pull at [35]-[37].

38 The other aspect of the applicant's third submission is his assertion made in his written submissions that the Tribunal member failed to give proper and genuine consideration to the relevant consideration of the expectations of the Australian community. There is no doubt that that is a relevant consideration: Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra); Direction No 21.

39 Paragraph 2.12 of Direction No 21 provides as follows:
 
 'Expectations of the Australian community 
 
 
 2.12 The Australian community expects non-citizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia. Where a non-citizen has breached, or where there is a significant risk that they will breach this trust or where the non-citizen has been convicted of offences in Australia or elsewhere, it may be appropriate to refuse the visa application or cancel the visa held by such a person. Visa refusal or cancellation and removal of the non-citizen may be appropriate simply because the nature of the character concerns or offences are such that the Australian community would expect that the person would not be granted a visa or should be removed from Australia. Decision-makers should have due regard to the Government's view in this respect.'

40 The approach of the Tribunal member was to note that the applicant had accumulated an extensive criminal record in a relatively short time. He referred to the arguments put on the applicant's behalf to the effect that the Tribunal should take a broader view of community expectations. It was put to him that if a person had been in Australia for almost 10 years, the community would expect that he would not be 'dumped' on another country and he should be regarded as Australia's problem. It was put to the Tribunal member that the applicant had been punished by imprisonment and should not be further punished by deportation, and even if he were, the visa cancellation process should be completed while he was still in prison. It was put to the Tribunal member that the community would also expect that the applicant would be rewarded for his attempts at rehabilitation and for a reasonable work history before he was sent to prison. It was put to the Tribunal member that evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances was also relevant to any assessment of expectations. The Tribunal member said:
 
 'In part the broader interpretation advocated depends on shifting factors from the community protection and other considerations categories into the process of evaluating community expectations. While the categories laid down in Direction No 21 cannot be regarded as rigid or inflexible, the approach laid down by the Direction is prima facie the one that the Tribunal should follow.'</text>

<text>36 An error of fact is not a jurisdictional error if there was some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made. An error of fact might, depending on its nature, indicate that the decision-maker did not give proper and genuine consideration to a matter he or she was bound to consider. That would be a jurisdictional error: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24. If there is error here, it is not of that nature. The Tribunal member clearly considered and considered thoroughly the best interests of the child and the applicant's relationship with his parents. The finding that his parents had not seen him since his release in early 2005 may or may not be an error, but if it is it is an error of fact. Taking into account the applicant's stay with his family in 2005 might lead one to qualify the finding that if in New Zealand the applicant could still maintain the sort of contact with his family that he had had in the past but, even if it did, that would amount to no more than an error of fact.

37 I reject the applicant's submission that there was a jurisdictional error because the Tribunal member failed to take into account the applicant's three-month stay with his family in 2005.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/50.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The applicant's first submission must be rejected. The High Court considered a similar submission in the recent case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 1 (' Nystrom '). That was a case unlike the present because the visa holder in that case was not liable to deportation under s 200 of the Act. However, the observations of the Court do not turn on that fact.
 
Heydon and Crennan JJ said (at [162]-[169]) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'Mr Nystrom's argument that the power to deport and the power to cancel a visa, which will result in removal, deal with the same subject matter is wrong. The power under s 200, as restricted by s 201, to deport non-citizens is a power in respect of the continuing presence in Australia of non-citizens convicted of certain crimes. The power under s 501(2) to cancel a visa of a non-citizen on character grounds (based on a "substantial criminal record") and thereby remove that non-citizen is a much wider power, although it is also for the protection of the Australian community. The powers are distinct and cumulative. 
 Not only do the powers have different purposes, different criteria apply for their exercise. The criteria in respect of a person's criminal record in s 201(c) and s 501(7) are not co-extensive, although there is some overlap between s 201(c) and s 501(7)(a), (b) and (c). Criteria in s 501(7)(d) and (e) give s 501(2) a wider field of operation than that which is covered by s 201(c). 
 Moreover, it was not disputed that different consequences follow when the powers are exercised. A person who is subject to a deportation order is subject to discretionary rather than mandatory detention during any challenge (ss 253(8) and (9)), but will then be deported unless the Minister revokes the order. A person who has a visa cancelled is subject to mandatory detention and removal (s 189) but may apply for a protection visa (s 501E). 
 While the powers are different, with different criteria for their exercise and different consequences when exercised, they are both special powers. The power in s 501(2), construed as it must be, together with ss 501(6) and (7), is not a vague or general power. The line of authority beginning with Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia , upon which Mr Nystrom relied, has no application here as there is no repugnancy between the two powers. In fact, they are consonant with each other. 
 The provisions have a different legislative history and a different relationship to the constitutional sources of power in s 51(xix) and (xxvii) as already explained. The Act contains two separate but consonant statutory systems for deportation and removal which operate differently, although the final outcome of removal may be the same. Section 201 does not in terms, confer on an alien any "statutory protection" from removal, consequent upon the cancellation of a visa under s 501(2). 
 Here, s 200 has no application. To that extent, the facts here raise the issue of the interaction between s 200, as restricted by s 201, and s 501(2), more squarely than the facts in Jia Legeng . This distinction provides no reason to reconsider the statement in Jia Legeng that s 501 contains a separate statutory power. In fact, the distinction is an illustration of the discrete nature of the powers in question. 
 Further, there is nothing in the relevant legislative history, or the terms of the two provisions, which would warrant "reading down" the power in s 501(2), which rests on s 51(xix), by reference to s 201(b)(i) which, while it applies to "non-citizens", derived its language and purpose from the Act's former resting on s 51(xxvii). 
 Accordingly, the power conferred in s 501(2) is not restricted by the operation of ss 200 and 201.' 
 

Gleeson CJ made the following observations at [2] (footnotes omitted):
 
 'As to the issue concerning the effect, if any, upon s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) of ss 200 and 201 of that Act, I would make the following comment. The contention that ss 200 and 201 give a person in the position of the respondent a protection or immunity from the exercise of the power conferred by s 501 is a statement of a conclusion, rather than an expression of a reason for reaching that conclusion. If there is such a reason, it must be found in a process of statutory construction. The provisions of s 501(2), on the one hand, and ss 200 and 201 on the other, are not repugnant, in the sense that they contain conflicting commands which cannot both be obeyed, or produce irreconcilable legal rights or obligations. They create two sources of power, by which a person in the position of the respondent may be exposed, by different processes, and in different circumstances, to similar practical consequences. There is nothing novel, or even particularly unusual, about that. It does not of itself mean that only one source of power is available. If, however, by reason of the apparent exhaustiveness with which one provision, or group of provisions, dealt with the position of a person such as the respondent, there were an incompatibility of a kind that required a conclusion that only one provision or group of provisions was intended to apply, then that would be a reason for accepting the respondent's contention. Again, if one provision, or group of provisions, were directed with particularity to the case of a person such as the respondent, and the other were merely of general application, the same could be said. As explained by Heydon and Crennan JJ, and also by Gummow and Hayne JJ, neither proposition can be made good when regard is had to the legislative history and context. In the result, the respondent's contention amounts to an assertion; a statement of an outcome that would be supportive of his freedom to remain in Australia, and in that sense protective of his interests, but without a convincing argument of statutory construction which sustains that outcome. Therefore, it fails.' 
 

The reasoning of Gummow and Heydon JJ was to similar effect (at [60]-[70]).
 
I applied this reasoning in the recent decision of Pull v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 20 at [31] - [33] (' Pull '). That case was also a case where the visa holder was not liable to deportation under s 200 of the Act.</text>

The reasoning of Gummow and Heydon JJ was to similar effect (at [60]-[70]).
 
I applied this reasoning in the recent decision of Pull v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 20 at [31] - [33] (' Pull '). That case was also a case where the visa holder was not liable to deportation under s 200 of the Act.

26 As to the second submission, the High Court has held that s 501(2) is a valid law with respect to aliens: Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 72 ; (2003) 218 CLR 28. In Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 the Full Court of this Court held, after it had identified the relevant considerations to the exercise of the power in s 501(2), that the section did not infringe or contravene Chapter III of the Constitution .
