<text>5 The first was the issue of performance risk. This is an issue which has been raised in a number of cases to which Mr Jackman referred. The most recent case is Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 at [23] .

6 I was satisfied that the "performance risk" was sufficiently addressed in relation to each of the Schemes for the reasons set out in the written submissions.

7 The second matter to which reference was made was an exclusivity provision contained in clause 19 of the Merger Implementation Agreement. This contained a "no shop restriction", a "no talk restriction" and a "no due diligence restriction".</text>

<text>8 Each of the concerns in relation to exclusivity clauses expressed by Santow J in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd [2001] NSWSC 40 ; (2001) 36 ACSR 758 at [9] was addressed in the written submissions.

9 The third issue to which Mr Jackman referred was the question of a break fee of $100 million provided for in cl 20.2 of the Merger Implementation Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137</tocase>
<text>11 The fourth issue was the deemed warranty in cl 4.5 of the Share Scheme that the shares be free from encumbrances. Mr Jackman referred me to the view which is accepted in this Court as stated in Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137 at [41]. This view has been followed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by Barrett J in Macquarie Private Capital A Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 366. The clause was therefore in accordance with established authority and it was drawn to the attention of scheme participants: see further Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd at [63].


 I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.
