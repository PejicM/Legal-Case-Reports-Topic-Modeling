<text>100 It is clear from a review of these provisions, the rules as they are to be applied by the Supreme Court express the court's discretion to order the consolidation or case management of proceedings more broadly than the counterpart rules in this Court. As r 28.5(a) and (b) combine to make clear, there is no specific principle requiring consolidation, nor any specific limitation against ordering it: A Goninan &amp; Co Ltd v Atlas Steel (Aust) Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 956.

101 If any of the conditions in r 28.5(a), (b) or (c) are met, proceedings may be consolidated (or dealt with in any way outlined in the rules) despite the fact that they have completely different parties.</text>

<text>32 The requirement of s 5(4) of the Cross-vesting Act is the existence of 'related proceedings' between the court in which the application is made and the court to which the matters are being sought to be transferred. The authorities on this issue establish that there do not need to be identical parties to the two, or more, proceedings before they can be considered to be 'related' for the purposes of enlivening the cross-vesting power of the court. It is enough that the proceedings have one common party and involves common issues and common questions: Watson v CGU Insurance Limited [2006] FCA 1630 ; AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd v Green [2004] NSWSC 1099 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 693.

<tocase>Bank of Queensland Limited (ACN 009 656 540) v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2008) 170 IR 427</tocase>
<text>13 On 11 December 2007, Greenwood J heard two motions in the Bank's Federal Court proceeding. By the first, the OMB parties sought an order pursuant to s 5(4) of the Cross-vesting Act that the proceeding be transferred to the Supreme Court. By the second, the Bank parties sought an order that particular paragraphs of the defence of the OMB parties be struck out, although, in submissions, the order sought was more confined. On 7 March 2008, his Honour re-opened the hearing to hear further evidence on the transfer motion and on 12 March 2008, he dismissed the transfer motion and ordered that a number of paragraphs of the defence of the OMB parties be struck out: Bank of Queensland Limited (ACN 009 656 540) v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2008) 170 IR 427.</text>

<tocase>Bank of Queensland Limited v Industrial Court of New South Wales (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1435</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1435.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Subsequently, on 19 September 2008, Logan J ordered that a number of paragraphs of the amended defence of the OMB parties be struck out: Bank of Queensland Limited v Industrial Court of New South Wales (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1435.

18 On 25 September 2008, the OMB parties filed an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of his Honour, Logan J, and that application, together with any ensuing appeal, will be heard by a Full Court on 26 November 2008. In the meantime, Greenwood J vacated the dates for the hearing of the Bank's Federal Court proceeding commencing on 13 October 2008, pending the hearing of the leave application and any ensuing appeal from Logan J's judgment.

19 This is the state of play in the Bank's Federal Court proceeding at the time of writing these reasons.

20 Traderight (New South Wales) Pty Ltd ('Traderight') (together with a number of individuals) commenced proceedings in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court claiming relief pursuant to ss 82 and 87 of the TPA; ss 68 and 72 of the FTA (NSW); s 106 of the IR Act; s 12GM of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ('the ASIC Act'); and damages for breach of contract and breach of duty, in relation to an OMB Agreement between the Bank and Traderight to establish an owner managed branch of the Bank in Castlereagh Street, Sydney ('the Traderight Supreme Court proceeding'). The amended statement of claim sets out a series of meetings between Bank representatives and a number of the plaintiffs, a sequence of contended representations at various times, reliance upon the representations, the falsity of those representations, detriment and consequential loss and a claim for remedial orders. The pleading contends that particular agreements including the OMB Agreement arising out of the particular events are susceptible of orders declaring the agreements void ab initio (among other orders).

27 The OMB parties seek that all the matters (including the Bank's Federal Court proceeding) be heard by one court and one judicial officer; the Supreme Court (as being the only court that can hear all matters). Greenwood J did not agree to transfer the Bank's Federal Court proceeding to the Supreme Court. The next best thing the OMB parties can ask for (in order to avoid multiple trials of fact on the same issues and involving the common parties, witnesses etc), is that the rest of the related matters be transferred to the Supreme Court.

28 Further, any proposal put forward in relation to cross-vesting must deal with the reality of the Traderight proceedings and the fact that the only court that can hear the entirety of the Traderight proceedings is the Supreme Court.

29 The Traderight proceedings are entirely unaffected by the Bank's Federal Court proceeding. The Traderight Group is not a party to that proceeding.

30 The Bank's preliminary attempt to strike out the s 106 component of the Traderight proceedings failed. This means that, regardless of what Greenwood J decides in respect of the Bank's 'constitutional challenge', the s 106 issue will be alive in the substantive proceedings in respect of at least the Traderight proceedings that are already before the Supreme Court.

31 The only court that has jurisdiction to hear all aspects of the case is the Supreme Court. The Bank accepts that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the s 106 claims.

112 When I put this to senior counsel for the Bank parties during the hearing of the motions, he responded:
 'It's an issue which we ventilated with his Honour Logan J the week before last in the strike-out application. It's a complex argument. We don't intend, if your Honour doesn't mind, ... to ventilate it fully before your Honour but we can tell your Honour it's been raised with his Honour Logan J as part of the strike-out application.'

113 His Honour's (Logan J's) response to that ventilation is instructive. At [19] of his Honour's reasons, he observed:
 'There is Full Bench authority in the New South Wales Industrial Commission, in Court Session, which would support an argument that "the making of representations known to be acted upon by a person in considering entry into a contractual relationship and on the basis of which representations an agent as the representor intends the person to act may well, quite apart from any other connection with the contract subsequently made, be itself an arrangement whereby work is performed in an industry, or, at the least, a collateral arrangement to such a contract or arrangement": Ace Business Brokers Pty Ltd v Phillips-Treby (2000) 100 IR 420, at 432, [28]. Contrary to the submission of the BoQ parties, it is thus not impossible for a representation to constitute an "arrangement". Further, if it is one, as the amended summons apparently alleges, and the submissions of the BoQ parties seem to ignore, whereby a person performs work in an industry, that arrangement, if unfair, may, all other things being equal, be the subject of relief under s 106 of the NSW Act. The Independent Contractors Act may or may not intrude on the ability to grant that relief, but that is not a matter for summary resolution.'

114 For these reasons, I do not think there is any utility in adjourning these motions to await the outcome of the Bank's Federal Court proceeding. It would be a total injustice to the OMB parties; at its present rate of progress, it could take years. For the same reasons, it is more appropriate (there can be no argument that the Rossmick Federal Court proceeding and the Jude Federal Court proceeding are respectively related, in the relevant statutory sense, to the Rossmick IC proceeding and the Jude IC proceeding) that these proceedings be determined by the Supreme Court; the same court will then hear all four proceedings.

115 On this basis alone, I am of the view that these proceedings should be transferred to the Supreme Court.</text>

<tocase>Bishop v Bridgelands Securities Pty Ltd (1990) 25 FCR 311 </tocase>
<text>66 The Bank parties submitted that in considering whether the proceedings would be consolidated or heard together, similar issues arise under Rule 28.5 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) as would arise on an application for joinder in reliance on O 6 r 2(b) of the Federal Court Rules . Matters relevant to the exercise of the discretion in respect of the latter rule were considered by Wilcox J in Bishop v Bridgelands Securities (1990) 25 FCR 311. Of particular relevance to this application is the passage at 314 315 where his Honour said:
 'Similarly, although all applicants might propose to rely upon some common, or similar facts, there may be such differences between the evidence intended to be relied upon in support of the claims of particular applicants as to make it inexpedient to join the claims. The discrete material may overbear that which is common to all the claims. Again, there may be cases in which the sheer number of the claims, if joinder is permitted, will impose an undue burden on the respondent; although it seems to me unlikely that this will be so except in cases where separate evidence is proposed to be adduced in support of individual claims.'

67 It is inherent in the OMB parties' submissions that they propose to lead evidence from the OMB parties, the Traderight applicants and, it seems, others which will fall into the category of evidence governed by s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) . That is, it appears to be the OMB parties' intention to call evidence from one person that representation X was made to that person for the purpose of persuading the Court that it is more likely that the same representation was also made to one or other of the various applicants.

103 The Bank parties drew the Court's attention to a selected passage in Bishop 25 FCR, where Wilcox J considered matters relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion. This case was decided by reference to O 6 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules so it cannot be relied upon as authoritative on how the Supreme Court is likely to make future case management decisions with respect to these matters under r 28.5 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules .

104 In any event, the case assists the OMB parties cross vesting motion, as the following excerpt at 314 indicate:
 'As the discretion conferred by sub-rule (b) is, in terms, unconfined, it would be inappropriate to specify circumstances in which it might be applied. Everything must depend upon the facts of the particular case. But it is appropriate to consider what principles ought to guide the exercise of such a discretion. The basic principle, as it seems to me, is that the Court should take whatever course seems to be the most conducive to a just resolution of the disputes between the parties, but having regard to the desirability of limiting, so far as practicable, the costs and delay of the litigation. Considerations of costs and delay may often support the grant of leave under sub-rule (b); but, in my opinion, leave ought not to be granted unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that joinder is unlikely to result in unfairness to any party. Secondly, regard must be had to practical matters. For example, if would normally be inappropriate to grant leave for the joinder of applicants who were represented by different solicitors. There must be a single solicitor, or firm of solicitors, who is accountable for the conduct of the proceeding on the applicants' side of the case.'

105 It is clear that the OMB parties in the proceedings before this Court and the plaintiffs in the Traderight proceedings are all represented by McCabe Terrill Lawyers.</text>

<text>68 There is no attempt in the OMB parties' material to identify with precision the evidence which falls into this category. There are merely general assertions. For evidence to be admissible under s 97(l) of the Evidence Act , it must have significant probative value. In determining whether evidence has significant probative value, the Court would take into account the differences in the representations alleged to have been made as well as the timing of the representations (cf. Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886 ; (2000) 106 FCR 51 at 69 71).

69 To the extent that an assumption can be made that the evidence of various of the OMB parties will reflect the allegations in their statements of claim, then it is apparent that there are substantial differences with respect to representations said to have been made to the OMB parties in the respective proceedings.

70 From the Traderight statement of claim, it is apparent that the Traderight proceedings concern events occurring between 28 January 2004 and 30 August 2006. There are 26 meetings pleaded and in 23 of them, representations are said to have been made. Those claimed to have made representations are Mr Allsop, Ms Quinn, an unnamed branch manager from New Farm, Mr McCarthy, Mr Liddy, Mr Teitzel, Mr McEvoy, Mr O'Brien, Mr Edwards, Ms Smith and Mr Ferguson.</text>

<tocase>Rossmick No. 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Limited [2008] FCAFC 81</tocase>

<text>14 On 8 April 2008, Spender J granted leave to the OMB parties to appeal against Greenwood J's judgment. The Full Court that heard this appeal rightly construed it as being restricted to challenging the orders of the primary judge made on the strike-out application; indeed, it was common ground that no appeal could be brought against an order dismissing an application to cross-vest proceedings to another court under the Cross-vesting Act: s 13 of that Act. On 23 May 2008, the appeal was allowed in part; a number of paragraphs of the defence of the OMB parties were struck out with the OMB parties being granted leave to re-plead generally: Rossmick No. 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Limited [2008] FCAFC 81.

15 On 19 June 2008, Greenwood J set the Bank's Federal Court proceeding down for hearing on 13 October 2008. On 7 July 2008, the OMB parties filed and served an amended defence and on 14 July 2008, the Bank parties filed a motion seeking to strike out a number of paragraphs of the amended defence. This motion was heard by Logan J on 18 and 22 July 2008 when his Honour reserved.

16 This was the state of play in the Bank's Federal Court proceeding when the transfer motions in the Rossmick Federal Court proceeding and the Jude Federal Court proceeding referred to in [1] above came before me on 7 August 2008.</text>
