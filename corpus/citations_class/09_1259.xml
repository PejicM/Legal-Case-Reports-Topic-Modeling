<text>The purpose of an order such as O 62 r 4 is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in litigation arising out of the taxation process: Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120; Leary v Leary [1987] 1 WLR 72. The power to order gross sum of costs is one which has to be exercised judicially, and after giving the parties adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: Auspine Ltd v Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd [1999] FCA 673 ; (1999) 93 FCR 1 ; Ualesi (t/a Australian Empire Imports) v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26.</text>

<tocase>Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 3) [2006] FCA 916</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/916.html</AustLII>
<text>In my view, not only it is likely that the additional costs of taxation would impose a significant burden on the respondent without any real prospects of recovering those additional costs, but also the expense, taxation and delay occasion to the respondent is likely to be disproportionate to the amount of the costs recoverable: Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 3) [2006] FCA 916 , at [28].

The evidence in the affidavit of Kathryn Elizabeth Finlayson sworn and filed 2 October 2009 establishes that the charges for professional costs, calculated according to the rate for a solicitor in force at the relevant times under item 31 of the Second Schedule of the Federal Court Rules , amount to $12,672.00, and disbursements amount to $160.75.

The actual costs incurred by the respondent, including disbursements, total $15,813.06.</text>

<tocase>Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 249 ALR 871</tocase>
<text>In my view, the fixing of a gross sum for costs in the sum of $12,832.75 is "logical, fair and reasonable": see Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 249 ALR 871 , at [25].

The order of the Court is that in respect of proceedings QUD 359 of 2008, the appellant pay the costs of the respondent of and incidental to the appeal, which I fix in the 
amount of $12,832.75.
 
 I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/228.html</AustLII>
<text>One factor which I regard as significant in exercising the discretion to make an order for gross sum of costs, in the circumstances of the present case, is that, having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant, the additional cost for taxation is likely to impose a significant burden on the respondent, without real prospects of recovering those additional costs: Sparnon v Apand Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 164 ; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788.</text>
