<tocase>General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation (1993) 45 FCR 164</tocase>
<text>25 The alternative claim for declarations avoids the difficulties of proving causation and some loss and damage but raises additional difficulties of its own. The respondents referred to authorities where the Court has said that it is not appropriate to make a declaration of a contravention of a provision of the Trade Practices Act either in the particular circumstances of the case before it, or in the absence of determining if the applicant is entitled to further relief such as damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act : Neeta (Epping) Pty Ltd v Phillips [1974] HCA 18 ; (1974) 131 CLR 286 per Barwick CJ and Jacobs J at 307; Magman International v Westpac Banking Corporation (1991) 32 FCR 1; General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 192-193; Jenkins v NZI Securities Australia Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 572 at 576; Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 673 per Hely J at 676 [13]-[21]. The cases suggest that one should be cautious about granting no more than declaratory relief on a summary judgment application and a consideration of all the circumstances may suggest that this should not be done. In my opinion it is not appropriate to grant a declaration of a contravention of the provision of the Trade Practices Act on an application for summary judgment unless the case is a particularly clear one and the other circumstances suggest that it is an appropriate case to do so. For the reasons I have given this is not a clear case, and the circumstances outlined in the following paragraph suggest that this is not an appropriate case.</text>
