<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1983/37.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In some circumstances actual net earnings might be seen as reflecting an ability to earn: Cage Developments Pty Ltd v Schubert [1983] HCA 37 ; (1983) 151 CLR 584. Gibbs CJ, Murphy, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ there observed at 587 8: 
 
 . . . there may well be cases in which the actual earnings of a business either represent the actual or potential earnings of a former worker during a period of partial incapacity. Where, for example, a business consists essentially of the provision of personal services by the former worker (eg a business of a sole plumber or casual gardener) and no significant investment of capital is involved, the actual net earnings of the business might properly be seen as representing the actual "reward for [the] labour" of the former worker (see J &amp; H Timbers Pty Ltd v Nelson, at 652) during a period of partial incapacity. In such a case, if the former worker is carrying on business solely on his own account, the net earnings of the business might properly be seen as representing the "amount he is earning" in a business; if he is carrying on business in partnership or as an employee of a family company, the net earnings might properly be seen as representing the "amount he ... is able to earn" either in employment or in a business.
 

 The difficulty with the approach of the Tribunal in the present proceedings is that the evidence the Tribunal was relying upon to reach its conclusion has not been identified; nor have findings of facts been made or reasons provided. The Tribunal has set forth a conclusion but none of the processes by which it reached that conclusion.</text>

<tocase>Comcare Australia v Woodbridge (Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, O'Loughlin J, 13 February 1996)</tocase>
<text>3 Section 19(2) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) relevantly provides as follows:
 
 Subject to this Part, Comcare is liable to pay to the employee in respect of the injury, for each week that is a maximum rate compensation week during which the employee is incapacitated, an amount of compensation worked out using the formula: 
 NWE AE
 where: 
 "AE" is the greater of the following amounts: 
 (a) the amount per week (if any) that the employee is able to earn in suitable employment; 
 (b) the amount per week (if any) that the employee earns from any employment (including self-employment) that is undertaken by the employee during that week. 
 "NWE" is the amount of the employee's normal weekly earnings. 
 
 
 
That provision, by its terms, requires a calculation to be undertaken whereby there is deducted from an employee's normal weekly earnings an amount which is the greater of either the weekly amount that an employee is " able to earn in suitable employment " or the amount which an employee earns from " any employment (including self-employment) that is undertaken by the employee during that week ". The legislative intention of this provision is presumably to ensure that an employee is not entitled to retain the whole of his actual earnings and also to retain 100% of his normal weekly earnings: Comcare v Line [2002] FCA 553 at [60] per Carr J. And, the amount that an employee may be " able to earn " is not to be equated with profit: J &amp; H Timbers Pty Ltd v Nelson [1972] HCA 12 ; (1972) 126 CLR 625. Windeyer J there observed at 643:
 
 ... The earning capacity of a man as a worker is measured by the remuneration that is the fruit of his labour, his wages or their equivalent. It is not to be measured by the profits he derives by embarking his capital in a business or by his usual capital equipment in earning money...

<tocase>Comcare v Holt [2007] FCA 405 , 94 ALD 576</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/405.html</AustLII>
<text>22 A Statement of Facts and Contentions should obviously not be construed with the constraints appropriate to a pleading in a Superior Court. Nor should a Statement of Facts and Contentions be filed with such generality that all issues which potentially may emerge will be held subsequently to fall within one or other of the matters set forth. But it should be drafted with a sufficient level of precision to enable both an opponent and the Tribunal to know the facts and contentions being raised for consideration. The procedures of the Tribunal are sufficiently flexible to permit of any subsequent need to revisit a Statement which has been filed if that is necessary to ensure that the " correct or preferable decision " is reached and reached in a manner which permits all parties to have a " reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ": Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s 39(1). Within those broad limits, the procedures followed by the Tribunal should be sufficiently flexible to permit new or additional contentions to be raised, where that is necessary to ensure that the Tribunal properly discharges its functions, and sufficiently flexible to ensure that contentions which may have been initially raised at the outset of proceedings are able to be later abandoned (eg, Comcare v Holt [2007] FCA 405 at [33] , [2007] FCA 405 ; 94 ALD 576 at 583 per Mansfield J).

23 Notwithstanding such flexibility, this first contention of Comcare is rejected.

24 But Comcare's alternative submission, namely that the Tribunal has impermissibly equated profit with an ability to earn, it is considered should prevail. Comcare's Contentions as filed with the Tribunal unequivocally asserted that Ms Davies had " an ability to earn in suitable employment ", and also that " an ability to earn should not be confused with ability to run a profitable business ".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/553.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Section 19(2) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) relevantly provides as follows:
 
 Subject to this Part, Comcare is liable to pay to the employee in respect of the injury, for each week that is a maximum rate compensation week during which the employee is incapacitated, an amount of compensation worked out using the formula: 
 NWE AE
 where: 
 "AE" is the greater of the following amounts: 
 (a) the amount per week (if any) that the employee is able to earn in suitable employment; 
 (b) the amount per week (if any) that the employee earns from any employment (including self-employment) that is undertaken by the employee during that week. 
 "NWE" is the amount of the employee's normal weekly earnings. 
 
 
 
That provision, by its terms, requires a calculation to be undertaken whereby there is deducted from an employee's normal weekly earnings an amount which is the greater of either the weekly amount that an employee is " able to earn in suitable employment " or the amount which an employee earns from " any employment (including self-employment) that is undertaken by the employee during that week ". The legislative intention of this provision is presumably to ensure that an employee is not entitled to retain the whole of his actual earnings and also to retain 100% of his normal weekly earnings: Comcare v Line [2002] FCA 553 at [60] per Carr J.

<tocase>Dodds v Comcare Australia (1993) 31 ALD 690</tocase>
<text>33 The requirement imposed by s 43(2B) of the 1975 Act has to be applied in the factual context being considered and applied in a realistic and practical manner. One objective of that provision, of course, is " to make the system of appeals effective ": Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 at [62] , [2005] HCA 40 ; 222 CLR 115. The adequacy of reasons provided, however, is also a matter of " substance ": Dodds v Comcare Australia (1993) 31 ALD 690. Burchett J at 691 there observed: 
 
 The obligation to furnish reasons, and to furnish reasons which are adequate, is a very important obligation. It is a pillar of the system of administrative decision-making by the Tribunal, and it is essential that the Court should insist on its fulfillment. But it is the substance of the obligation that matters. Indeed, as Lord Suniner pointed out in 55 Hontestroom v 55 Sagaporack [19271 AC 37 at 50, even a Judge's reasons on a question of fact will not be vitiated by "imperfections in form and expression". Section 43 is not to be construed in a pedantic spirit, but sensibly. If the Tribunal's reasons exposed the logic of its decision, and contained findings on those matters of fact which are essential to that logic, it will not be, easy to demonstrate a failure of compliance with the requirement to include "findings on material questions of fact".</text>

<tocase>Drake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409</tocase>
<text>19 Even where one or other or both parties are represented before the Tribunal, a party may depart from the contentions it has identified in its written Statement . Indeed, to conclude otherwise may confine the ability of the Tribunal to discharge its principal function of making the " correct or preferable decision ": Drake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 419. Factual or legal contentions or issues different to those raised in a Statement of Facts and Contentions may emerge in any one of a number of ways, including from questions asked by the Tribunal or that arise from evidence given and subsequent cross-examination. Facts or contentions different to those raised in a Statement of Facts and Contentions may also arise from the manner in which a case is opened or even, although far from desirable, in closing submissions.

20 In the present proceedings before the Tribunal, however, such questions as were asked of Ms Davies in cross-examination, it is considered, could not fairly be construed as raising for resolution the potential for Ms Davies to engage in other forms of suitable employment. Neither the invoices disclosing monies charged for lecturing or the questions asked of her during cross-examination would have alerted her to the possibility that Comcare could be suggesting the development of that part of her abilities as other " suitable employment ".</text>

<tocase>Ferriday v Repatriation Commission (1996) 69 FCR 521</tocase>
<text>46 In some circumstances this Court may proceed to resolve a submission which has not previously been raised before the Tribunal: Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334. Bowen CJ there observed at 343:
 
 ... In my opinion a party is not necessarily precluded by the conduct of his case before the Tribunal from arguing on "appeal" matters conceded below. If he is successful then the decision of the Tribunal may be overturned -- found in some way to be wrong in law, even though that error may have been substantially contributed to by the conduct of the case by the party in question. In other words, the conduct of the party's case before the Tribunal goes to this court's discretion as to what course it will take given that there has been an error rather than to the question as to whether the Tribunal really made an error. 
 The case before this court is not merely one of parties agreeing upon what facts should be decided by the trier of fact, nor a case of facts, peculiarly within the knowledge of the party, being conceded. Rather, there was a clear statutory precondition upon which the Tribunal had to be satisfied and enough material and evidence before it to raise the issue independently of the parties' submissions. In these circumstances it was an error of law not to consider and decide the issue of immigrant status. Whether or not that error should lead to the decision of the Tribunal being set aside and the matter remitted to it depends, in my view, upon principles similar to those expressed by Dixon J in Burston's case, supra and by the same judge in Orr v Holmes [1948] HCA 16 ; (1948) 76 CLR 632 at 640: "to fulfil an imperative demand of justice". 


 Appl'd: Ferriday v Repatriation Commission (1996) 69 FCR 521 at 527 8 per Lee J. The present appeal, it is considered, is not such a case. Left unexplored with Ms Davies is what may constitute " suitable employment " other than her Bali Gardens business and the quantification of her ability to earn. Although these may be matters fundamental to the application of s 19(2), each is very much a factual matter which to date has largely been left unexplored in the evidence and is best left to the Tribunal to undertake. The fact that other issues have also been left unresolved by the Tribunal, only further reinforces the desirability of leaving all issues to the Tribunal to determine upon the basis of such further evidence (if any) as is considered appropriate.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/268.html</AustLII>
<text>39 It is unnecessary to place reliance upon a further submission advanced on behalf of Comcare that error on the part of the Tribunal is further exposed -- or at least supported -- by the failure of the Tribunal to make reference to s 19(2) in terms. Comcare sought to draw some support for its contention that s 19(2) had not been properly considered from the fact that the Tribunal expressly refers to s 19(4), but makes no reference to s 19(2). Section 43(2B) does not require the Tribunal to include or make reference to law or legal principles: cf McAuliffe v Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 268 ; (1991) 13 AAR 462 at 469 per von Doussa J. Had it been necessary to resolve this submission, it most probably would have been resolved against Comcare. Although not referring to s 19(2), it is evident from the Tribunal's reasons that it was directing its consideration to the subject matter of s 19(2) and applying its provisions to the facts before it. Hence the Tribunal referred to: " What amount, if any, was Ms Davies able to earn in 'suitable employment'? " It also gave consideration to, " What was 'suitable employment' for Ms Davies? ", and separate consideration to, " What amount was Ms Davies able to earn in her employment in her own business during the period 28 September 1999 to 19 April 2006? "

40 Order 5 as made by the Tribunal quantified Ms Davies' ability to earn as " nil " for the period ending on " 30 June 2004 ".

41 The period for which compensation was payable ended on 19 April 2006.</text>

<text>31 Section 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) provides as follows:
 
 Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. 
 

The nature and extent of this obligation has been extensively canvassed. For the purposes of the resolution of the present appeal it is sufficient to note that the reasons of the Tribunal are " meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed ": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 , 185 CLR 259 at 272.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2007/1829.html</AustLII>
<text>1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 3 October 2007: Re Davies and Comcare [2007] AATA 1829. In that decision the Tribunal concluded that as from 3 December 2001 Ms Davies had been partially incapacitated for work as a result of an injury she had suffered and was entitled to compensation in respect to that injury.

2 Comcare seeks to appeal from that decision. Its Grounds of Appeal are:
 
(i) whether the Tribunal misconstrued the meaning of the phrase " able to earn " as it arises in subsection 19(2) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth); and 
 

 
(ii) whether the Tribunal failed to provide adequate reasons as required pursuant to subsection 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) for that part of its decision at paragraph 71(5).
 
 
 
 

Paragraph 71(5) of the Tribunal's decision concluded that:
 
 during the period 3 December 2001 to 30 June 2004 inclusive, the amount which Ms Davies was able to earn in employment in the business was nil.</text>

Its failure to do so is a departure from the requirements imposed by s 43(2B) and renders " ineffective " the appeal process to this Court. In the absence of explanation, neither Ms Davies nor this Court knows how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it did. In the absence of explanation, it would appear that the Tribunal has wrongly equated net profit with earning ability.</text>

Its failure to do so is a departure from the requirements imposed by s 43(2B) and renders " ineffective " the appeal process to this Court. In the absence of explanation, neither Ms Davies nor this Court knows how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it did. In the absence of explanation, it would appear that the Tribunal has wrongly equated net profit with earning ability.</text>

<text>31 Section 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) provides as follows:
 
 Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. 
 

The nature and extent of this obligation has been extensively canvassed. For the purposes of the resolution of the present appeal it is sufficient to note that the reasons of the Tribunal are " meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed ": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 , 185 CLR 259 at 272. But it is equally important " to review the Tribunal's reasons to be satisfied that the Tribunal has in fact had regard to the matters which it must address ": Zhang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 30 at [14] .</text>
