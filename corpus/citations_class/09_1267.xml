<text>In SZAXY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 76 at [11] , Wilcox J observed: 
 
 Views may sometimes differ as to whether a particular procedural step ought to be taken in the conduct of a review. The fact that the Court might have formed a different opinion to the Tribunal member in relation to a procedural decision does not in itself demonstrate lack of good faith by the Tribunal. 
 

His Honour's observation was made in the context of a challenge on the administrative law error ground of bad faith, but it might equally well have been made to like effect in respect of any challenge on the basis of unreasonableness to a procedural decision made by the Tribunal. It is not impossible to conceive of a case whereby an unreasonable decision in respect of a matter of procedure on the part of the Tribunal might, for example, violate the obligation found in s 425(1) , to invite a visa applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.

Equally, it is not impossible to see how an unreasonable allowance of time to respond to a request under s 424A or the provision of information in response to an invitation given by the Tribunal might violate the requirements of that section. "Unreasonableness" here though would have to be of the order that no reasonable Tribunal in the circumstances could have made the particular procedural decision which it did. The decision would have to be to adopt an adjective appropriately put forward on behalf of the Minister: "capricious". That is not this case in respect of the circumstances attending the making of the Tribunal's decision, as the learned Federal Magistrate plainly appreciated.

It is evident that the Tribunal considered on the merits and made value judgments reasonably open in respect of each procedural event which occurred between the filing of the review application and the making of the final decision. One of the earlier procedural events concerned whether the Appellant was then not just physically but also mentally able to attend and give evidence and present his case at a hearing. The Tribunal took the initiative of inviting the Appellant to attend upon a specialist psychiatrist for the purpose of a report being furnished concerning his then state of health and wellbeing. This the Tribunal was entitled to do. The Tribunal then acted on the strength of the report given in making an earlier procedural value judgment. Again, the Tribunal was entitled to act upon such information. As the learned Federal Magistrate remarked at para 11, Dr Walker (the psychiatrist concerned) provided that opinion and as a result the Tribunal put off a hearing for a very considerable period of time: 
 
 As I have already noted, after April 2008 the applicant no longer made any complaints of a psychological nature.

The Tribunal certainly did not prevent the applicant from finding his own doctor. It merely noted: "He was indigent and would have difficulty in so doing." The learned Federal Magistrate observed prosaically but not inaccurately that: 
 
 This tribunal bent over backwards to assist the applicant and give him extensions of time for a period of over a year from June 2007 when he lodged his application to July 2008 when the last hearing was scheduled. 
 

 
 
 I respectfully agree with those observations.</text>

<text>In SZLLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 185 ; (2009) 107 ALD 352 at [19] , Perram J observed that: 
 
 The Full Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 establishes three propositions which are pertinent. First, the invitation contemplated by section 425 must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture: at [33]. Second, another way of putting the first requirement may be to say that the tribunal must provide a 'real and meaningful' invitation: at [37]. Third, what is real and meaningful is to be objectively determined and the obligation exists whether or not the tribunal is aware of the circumstances which would defeat that obligation: at [37].</text>

Like Perram J in SZLLY, I am bound by the Full Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553. Even if it were open to me to embark upon a debate as to the correctness of that decision and. constituting the appellate division as a single judge I do not consider that it is open, the circumstances of this case do not give rise to a violation of the hearing invitation requirement in s 425. A hearing date was reasonably offered and no advantage was taken of it. Even objectively, there is no basis for apprehending a breach of s 425 based on circumstances prevailing at the time but unknown to the Tribunal. There was no obligation on the part of the Tribunal, that hearing having long since past, even to consider whether or not to defer the making of a decision pending the taking of oral evidence from the witness named in the Appellant's letter of 17 October. The position might have been different, for example, had there been an explanation in the letter of 17 October as to why that witness had not hitherto been available and details given of exactly the evidence the witness proposed was to give.

What remains then is a complaint concerning the rejection by the Tribunal of an information report regarding the kidnapping of the Appellant's brother. It is not apparent that this ground was one pressed in the proceeding before the Federal Magistrate, although that might just perhaps be a matter of inadequacy of command of language on the part of an Appellant who has some knowledge but an incomplete knowledge of English. It is important though to remember that the jurisdiction exercised by this Court is appellate, not original, in respect of matters such as this.

The short answer, in any event, to the second ground of appeal is that, having regard to the Tribunal's reasons, it was open to the Tribunal to reach the views that it did. The Tribunal is not obliged on the strength of a review application alone to be satisfied in terms of a protection obligation existing. It is for an applicant to put such material as he or she is able to engender that state of satisfaction. That ability includes an ability on request to attend at a hearing. It also extends to making a response to s 424A request for information. The appellant did not take advantage of either of these opportunities. The views that the Tribunal reached were reasonably open to it on the basis of the material that it had.</text>
