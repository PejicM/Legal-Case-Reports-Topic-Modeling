<text>49 I should note that, even if the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant had been joined as a party as at 3 May 2007, in my view it is unlikely that it would have been entitled to recovery of its costs in connection with preparation of the relevant affidavits given that these were costs incurred prior to joinder (cf Bluescope Steel Ltd (ACN 000 011 058) v Kelly [2007] FCA 517 at [192] and Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCA 1505 at [40] ).

 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 

 
 1. The native title determination application Edna Van Hemmen and Ors on behalf of the Kabi Kabi People #3 v State of Queensland and Ors QUD136 of 2006 filed 7 April 2006 be dismissed pursuant to s 84C Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).
 2. There be no order as to costs in respect of the collation and preparation of those affidavits filed in this matter on 20 April 2007 by the applicant in the proceedings known as Lance Hill and Ors on behalf of the Kabi Kabi People #2 v State of Queensland and Ors QUD65 of 2006.

<text>8 To the extent that there is overlap with respect to the operation of s 84C and O 20 r 2 in the context of native title cases, I note that:
 
 
 &#8226; unlike O 20 r 2 which applies generally, s 84C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act 
 &#8226; section 84C applies where an application does not comply with ss 61 , 61A or 62 , whereas O 20 r 2 is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or the proceeding is an abuse of process
 &#8226; the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike-out under s 84C with those of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 at [48] - [49] . Accordingly the Courts approach such matters with caution, and on the basis that no court proceeding should be summarily dismissed except in a very clear case: Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 89.</text>

<tocase>Booth v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 418</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/418.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant, in supporting the notice of motion to dismiss Kabi Kabi #3, submitted in summary as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; The Kabi Kabi #3 Application produces no evidence that the alleged decision-making process resulting in that native title determination application was a mandatory traditional process involving traditional laws and customs which needed to be followed.
 &#8226; In terms of s 251B of the Act , an agreed process of decision-making is applicable if there is no mandatory traditional process of decision-making under traditional laws and customs. Where a native title determination application is based upon an agreed process, the applicant must identify how the process was agreed upon, and how it was put into practice.
 &#8226; It is open to the Court to infer that the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant cannot identify such a process in relation to that application, in that the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant did not produce relevant evidence to the Court in response to the notice of motion to dismiss the application, and that it is also unlikely that any new material of relevance could be produced to the Tribunal.
 &#8226; There has been no consultation process in the case of Kabi Kabi #3 involving invitations, notice or discussions with people relevant to any native title claim concerning the Kabi Kabi people, and no evidence has been produced to establish eldership in relation to those people in Kabi Kabi #3 who assert eldership. Accordingly, the decision-making process is, on the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant's own material, seriously defective to the point of being incurable. 
 
 State of Queensland

18 Mr Prowse for the State of Queensland submitted:
 
 
 &#8226; there cannot be valid authorisation of both claims in Kabi Kabi #2 and Kabi Kabi #3
 &#8226; the material filed by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant does not sufficiently address the authorisation issue
 &#8226; if the current situation continued, with competing claims, the view of the State was that more time and money would be wasted in fruitless interlocutory applications. 
 
 Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant

19 Mr Poynton, for the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant, opposed the dismissal application. In summary, his submissions were as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; it was accepted that the Kabi Kabi #3 claim had failed the registration test of the Tribunal on the basis of failure of correct authorisation
 &#8226; the Act was amended at the beginning of 2007
 &#8226; as sworn by Ms Bernice Anning, solicitor for the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant, in an affidavit of 2 May 2007, the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant had been contacted by the Tribunal on the basis that, although Kabi Kabi #3 had failed the registration test on 31 August 2006, the changes to the Act meant that the Tribunal was required to test the application again, and had assigned a case manager to help with any questions
 &#8226; accordingly, it would be premature for the Court to "close the administrative window of opportunity" opened by the legislature and the Tribunal by dismissing the Kabi Kabi #3 Application
 &#8226; an alternative way forward would be for the Court to order an adjournment until later in 2007, to allow the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant time to have their material prepared, submitted to the Tribunal, and be allowed to take advantage of the legislature's change of the law
 &#8226; it would be unfair to strike out the Kabi Kabi #3 Application, and not the Kabi Kabi #2 Application.

27 Third, as I have already noted, Ms MacDonald also deposed that a majority decision arrived at during a meeting held in accordance with Australian meeting rules and conventions conforms to the traditional values associated with Kabi Kabi decision meeting in appropriate conditions (cf similar comments of Mr Alexander Davidson in his affidavit of 11 October 2004 (para 11)). However in the absence of more precise evidence, I am not prepared to accept at this stage that majority vote is a method of decision-making in accordance with traditional Aboriginal law and custom in relation to the Kabi Kabi people. Mr Niblett in his report makes no reference to majority voting as conforming to traditional decision-making processes. Further, to paraphrase comments of Tamberlin J in similar circumstances in Booth v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 418 , there is no other evidence, oral or written, before me as to the constitution of the group or the basis on which it is claimed that a majority vote would be sufficient, or indeed as to who and how many persons are entitled to vote and precisely what is meant by the expression "majority vote" ( Booth [2003] FCA 418 at [11] ).

28 Fourth, if the authorisation process concerning the Kabi Kabi #3 claim was not in conformity with traditional law and customs, it is not clear to me on the evidence that the native title claim group agreed to and adopted any particular decision-making process in relation to authorising the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant to make the Kabi Kabi #3 Application. I note and accept the submissions of Mr Rangiah for QSNTS in this regard concerning the lack of evidence or detail as to the authorisation process in that case.

29 Finally, I note that the submissions of Mr Poynton for the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant in this matter are not that the application is authorised and in accordance with s 61 , but are confined to a request for more time to allow it to, in the words of Mr Poynton, take advantage of "an administrative window of opportunity" offered by the Tribunal in relation to testing the application. In my view this submission does not address the key issues before the Court in relation to the current notice of motion. In particular:
 
 
 &#8226; notwithstanding the formal offer by the Tribunal to test the application again, the applicant provides no explanation to this Court as to how or why, as a result of amendments to the Act , it is possible that the Tribunal may view the claim as authorised whereas previously it had not
 &#8226; no additional evidence was produced by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant to the Court in response to the notice of motion to have the Kabi Kabi #3 Application struck out demonstrating that the Kabi Kabi #3 Application was in fact authorised
 &#8226; the written submissions of QSNTS in relation to flaws in the alleged authorisation process in Kabi Kabi #3 have not been addressed by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant
 &#8226; I fail to understand how extra time allowed to the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant in these circumstances will address a key issue raised by Mr Rangiah, namely that there are currently two applications allegedly authorised by Kabi Kabi people, covering a very similar area of land and involving eleven common apical ancestors, however both applications cannot be authorised, and either one or both of the applications must not be authorised in accordance with s 61(1) of the Act .

30 Mr Poynton has also submitted that it would be unfair to strike out the Kabi Kabi #3 Application and not the Kabi Kabi #2 Application. However in my view this submission is of little weight, as I note from the undertaking of Mr Preston on behalf of his client that the effect of striking-out the Kabi Kabi #3 Application is that the Kabi Kabi #2 Application will be discontinued.

31 It is unnecessary in these circumstances that I deal with O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules . The Kabi Kabi #3 Application does not comply with s 61 of the Act and accordingly should be struck out pursuant to s 84C.</text>

<tocase>Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/57.html</AustLII>
<text>45 Mr Topp for the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant submitted in summary:
 
 
 &#8226; the notice of motion of 29 June 2006 was an interlocutory step in the proceeding. Costs of interlocutory proceedings should be costs in the cause and not taxed until the end of the proceedings: O 62 r 3(3) Federal Court Rules , Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 57 
 &#8226; as a consequence of s 85A, in relation to native title applications there is no expectation that costs will follow the event
 &#8226; persons, entities or groups other than the respondents should not be entitled to any form of costs order in respect of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion, whether a deemed costs in their cause order or at all. The directions made on 9 March 2007, where the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant was ordered to serve the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant with the relevant documents, did not require or otherwise oblige the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to file affidavits, outlines of argument or any other material, nor to do anything else at all.

46 I note the submission of Mr Preston that the 29 June 2006 notice of motion had been on foot for almost a year at the time of the hearing of 3 May 2007, and that the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant had known since at least late April 2006 that authorisation was an issue in the proceedings. In this respect advancement of the Kabi Kabi #3 Application appears to have been afflicted by some ennui.

47 However, I also note that, while not determinative of the claim of the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant, no orders have been sought by State of Queensland, Gurang Land Council or QSNTS, which were parties to the proceedings, for costs against the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant in relation to its discontinuance of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1174.html</AustLII>
<text>48 In my view the following points are relevant in considering the issue of costs:
 
 
 &#8226; first, the policy of the Act with respect to costs as articulated in s 85A is that parties should bear their own costs unless there are such circumstances as specified in s 85A(2): De Rose [2005] FCAFC 137. Logically, it follows that this policy is equally applicable to non-parties - such as the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant - who incur costs in respect of litigation under the Act 
 &#8226; second, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant requested at the directions hearing of 9 March 2007 that it be served with such material as the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant should file and serve on the respondents to the Kabi Kabi #3 Application, and that it should be entitled to be heard at the hearing on 3 May 2007. In my view the position of the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is analogous to that of an intervener in this case, and I note that as a general rule the Court tends not to apply conventional rules as to recovery of costs to interveners: Wilcox J in CFMEU v Queensland Coal and Oil Shale Mining Industry (Superannuation) Ltd [2003] FCA 1174 at [11] - [12] 
 &#8226; third, as Mr Topp submitted, the directions made on 9 March 2007 did not require or otherwise oblige the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to file affidavits, outlines of argument or any other material, nor to do anything else at all. Indeed, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is not a party to the proceedings. While the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant has an interest in the proceedings for obvious reasons, I can identify no requirement of reason or justice which entitles the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to recover its costs against the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant with respect to preparation of material for the hearing of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion
 &#8226; in these circumstances, and taking into account the principle that an order for payment of costs in favour of a non-party will be exceptional and therefore must be treated with considerable caution, in my view it is not appropriate to order the costs sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to be paid by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant.</text>

<tocase>De Rose v State of South Australia (No 3) [2005] FCAFC 137</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/137.html</AustLII>
<text>38 This section was considered by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305, whose comments were subsequently adopted and summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 3) [2005] FCAFC 137 at [8] in the following terms:
 
 
 &#8226; section 85A(1) is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that unless cause is shown for another order, costs will follow the event
 &#8226; nonetheless, s 85A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion
 &#8226; there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order. It follows that the exercise of the discretion is not conditional upon a finding of fact or the formation of an opinion as to the occurrence of unreasonable conduct or the existence of special circumstances
 &#8226; section 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party acts unreasonably, but s 85A(2) does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1) 
 &#8226; the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order are left to the Court's discretion, which must be exercised judicially. However, the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs. 
 
 Costs in favour of non-parties

43 Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant submitted in summary:
 
 
 &#8226; any consideration of an award of costs on the discontinuance of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion must occur in light of s 85A of the Act 
 &#8226; as made clear in Ward [1999] FCA 580 ; 93 FCR 305 and De Rose [2005] FCAFC 137 
 
 
 
 
 o the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs
 o there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order under s 85A(2) 
 o section 85A(2) does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1). 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; the conduct of the parties in the matter and the reasons for the discontinuance of a matter can bear heavily on the exercise of the discretion as to costs, so that if the discontinuance can be said to be an acknowledgement of likely defeat or no objective circumstance provides reasons for the discontinuance, a costs order in favour of the other party will ordinarily be made (Finn J in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [13] )
 &#8226; a significant number of circumstances exist which would justify an award of costs against the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant in this case
 &#8226; it is an underlying policy in the Federal Court Rules that the discontinuing party should be liable for the other party's costs unless the Court orders otherwise
 &#8226; the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant did not comply with the directions of 9 March 2007 and file material, and did not inform the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant of the decision to discontinue the application to amend until after the due date had passed to file material
 &#8226; the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant filed material by the due date and has thrown away costs as a result
 &#8226; the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant should be ordered to pay those costs of the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant.

48 In my view the following points are relevant in considering the issue of costs:
 
 
 &#8226; first, the policy of the Act with respect to costs as articulated in s 85A is that parties should bear their own costs unless there are such circumstances as specified in s 85A(2): De Rose [2005] FCAFC 137. Logically, it follows that this policy is equally applicable to non-parties - such as the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant - who incur costs in respect of litigation under the Act 
 &#8226; second, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant requested at the directions hearing of 9 March 2007 that it be served with such material as the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant should file and serve on the respondents to the Kabi Kabi #3 Application, and that it should be entitled to be heard at the hearing on 3 May 2007. In my view the position of the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is analogous to that of an intervener in this case, and I note that as a general rule the Court tends not to apply conventional rules as to recovery of costs to interveners: Wilcox J in CFMEU v Queensland Coal and Oil Shale Mining Industry (Superannuation) Ltd [2003] FCA 1174 at [11] - [12] 
 &#8226; third, as Mr Topp submitted, the directions made on 9 March 2007 did not require or otherwise oblige the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to file affidavits, outlines of argument or any other material, nor to do anything else at all. Indeed, the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant is not a party to the proceedings. While the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant has an interest in the proceedings for obvious reasons, I can identify no requirement of reason or justice which entitles the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to recover its costs against the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant with respect to preparation of material for the hearing of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion
 &#8226; in these circumstances, and taking into account the principle that an order for payment of costs in favour of a non-party will be exceptional and therefore must be treated with considerable caution, in my view it is not appropriate to order the costs sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant to be paid by the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant.</text>

<tocase>Gore v Justice Corporation [2002] FCA 354 ; (2002) 119 FCR 429</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/354.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The courts have recognised that there is no absence of jurisdiction to order costs against non-parties in the strict sense and that the jurisdiction could be exercised against persons who were considered to be the "real parties" to the litigation, such as where a party to the litigation is insolvent, and a non-party has played an active part in the conduct of litigation and has an interest in the subject of the litigation: Mason CJ and Deane J (Gaudron J agreeing) in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 188 and 193. This does not mean however that the categories of third parties who may be made liable for the costs of litigation are limited to those articulated by their Honours in Knight : Gore v Justice Corporation [2002] FCA 354 ; (2002) 119 FCR 429 at 437.

40 The order sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant in this case may be distinguished however from such cases as Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 and Gore [2002] FCA 354 ; 119 FCR 429 in that, in this case, costs are sought by a non-party against a party to the litigation. While claims by non-parties seeking costs in their favour against parties to litigation are rare, they are not unknown: for example Re Pan Pharmaceuticals; Selim v McGrath [2004] NSWSC 129 and O'Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1559. In O'Keefe [2005] FCA 1559 Nicholson J said in the context of such claims in the Federal Court:
 
 "17 The jurisdiction of the Court to award costs is found in s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia 1976 (Cth) ('the Act '). It follows from the terms of that section that the jurisdiction is conditioned by there being 'costs' and those costs being in 'proceedings before the Court'. Section 4 of the Act defines 'proceeding' to mean 'a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding...'. In Knight v FP Special Assets Limited [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 it was held by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, McHugh J dissenting, that the discretion to award costs under O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland was not confined to the parties in the proceedings. That rule provided for the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the court to be in the discretion of the court or judge. Gaudron J at 205 stated that it was contrary to long-established principle and wholly inappropriate that a grant of power to a court should be construed as subject to a limitation not appearing in the words of the grant; that is, the words used should be given their full meaning unless there is something to indicate to the contrary. Therefore, her Honour stated the necessity for the power to be exercised judicially tends in favour of the most liberal construction.
 18 In O'Keeffe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 591 at 597 Spender J stated that, in the absence of any express restriction on the orders for costs that may be made concerning intervention or associated with it, the unfettered discretion conferred on the Federal Court by s 43 of the Act applied in the context of awarding costs in favour of a non-party intervener.
 19 In King v GIO Australia Holdings Limited [2001] FCA 1773 ; (2001) 116 FCR 509 at 515, after referring to what was stated by Spender J in O'Keeffe , Moore J said he was prepared to assume that s 43 of the Act is cast in sufficiently wide terms as to enable the Court to make an order for costs in the proceeding for the benefit of a non-party.
 20 This line of authority, although not greatly developed, would support a conclusion that there is power in the Court pursuant to s 43 to make an order for costs in favour of a non-party."</text>

It follows from the terms of that section that the jurisdiction is conditioned by there being 'costs' and those costs being in 'proceedings before the Court'. Section 4 of the Act defines 'proceeding' to mean 'a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding...'. In Knight v FP Special Assets Limited [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 it was held by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, McHugh J dissenting, that the discretion to award costs under O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland was not confined to the parties in the proceedings. That rule provided for the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the court to be in the discretion of the court or judge. Gaudron J at 205 stated that it was contrary to long-established principle and wholly inappropriate that a grant of power to a court should be construed as subject to a limitation not appearing in the words of the grant; that is, the words used should be given their full meaning unless there is something to indicate to the contrary. Therefore, her Honour stated the necessity for the power to be exercised judicially tends in favour of the most liberal construction.
 18 In O'Keeffe Nominees Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 591 at 597 Spender J stated that, in the absence of any express restriction on the orders for costs that may be made concerning intervention or associated with it, the unfettered discretion conferred on the Federal Court by s 43 of the Act applied in the context of awarding costs in favour of a non-party intervener.
 19 In King v GIO Australia Holdings Limited [2001] FCA 1773 ; (2001) 116 FCR 509 at 515, after referring to what was stated by Spender J in O'Keeffe , Moore J said he was prepared to assume that s 43 of the Act is cast in sufficiently wide terms as to enable the Court to make an order for costs in the proceeding for the benefit of a non-party.
 20 This line of authority, although not greatly developed, would support a conclusion that there is power in the Court pursuant to s 43 to make an order for costs in favour of a non-party."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1637.html</AustLII>
<text>24 I note that the fact that the group comprising the applicant does not include all possible members of the group would not in itself mean that the authority of the applicant was absent if it was in fact a representative body, however as pointed out by Wilcox J in Moran v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 at [34] :
 
 a person who wishes to rely on a decision by a representative or other collective body needs to prove that such a body exists under customary law recognised by the members of the group, the nature and extent of the body's authority to make decisions binding the members of the group and that the body has authorised the making of the application.

25 I am not satisfied that such a representative body exists in this case as contemplated by his Honour in Moran [1999] FCA 1637.

26 Second, although it is asserted in the Kabi Kabi #3 Application that the authorisation of the application in this case was pursuant to a process of decision-making in accordance with traditional laws and customs, it does not appear to be in dispute that a traditional decision-making process involves, inter alia , appropriate consultation, and consensus of relevant persons in the group (Niblett affidavit paras 11-19, MacDonald affidavit paras 7- 8). Even if the decision-making process in Kabi Kabi #3 had elements of traditional law and customs, I note comments of Mr Niblett that the processes of decision-making referred to in affidavits of persons comprising the Kabi Kabi #3 Applicant did not appear to have had the level of collective interaction and discussion to be expected in the "traditional" context, nor may all relevant parties have been adequately consulted. In this respect I note from Ms MacDonald's affidavit that she predicated her comments concerning majority decision-making on adequate consultation of relevant persons, which is in serious dispute in this case as is clear from evidence of, for example, Mr Niblett, Ms Bond, Mr Dalton and Ms Yavu-Kama-Harathunian.</text>

<text>40 The order sought by the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant in this case may be distinguished however from such cases as Knight [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 and Gore [2002] FCA 354 ; 119 FCR 429 in that, in this case, costs are sought by a non-party against a party to the litigation. While claims by non-parties seeking costs in their favour against parties to litigation are rare, they are not unknown: for example Re Pan Pharmaceuticals; Selim v McGrath [2004] NSWSC 129 and O'Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1559.

42 Ultimately in O'Keefe [2005] FCA 1559 his Honour did not need to decide the issue. In Pan Pharmaceuticals [2004] NSWSC 129 Barrett J took the view that "some very special factor outside the ordinary and expected course of events and engendering a justifiable expectation of compensation in the mind of the non-party would have to be found before any relevant aspect of the comprehensive jurisdiction with respect to costs might be regarded as properly and regularly invoked in favour of a non-party as against a party. In other words, such an award, if ever appropriate, will be extraordinary and exceptional" (at [20]). His Honour in that case declined to make an order in favour of the non-parties seeking costs.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/580.html</AustLII>
<text>38 This section was considered by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305, whose comments were subsequently adopted and summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 3) [2005] FCAFC 137 at [8] in the following terms:
 
 
 &#8226; section 85A(1) is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that unless cause is shown for another order, costs will follow the event
 &#8226; nonetheless, s 85A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion
 &#8226; there is no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order. It follows that the exercise of the discretion is not conditional upon a finding of fact or the formation of an opinion as to the occurrence of unreasonable conduct or the existence of special circumstances
 &#8226; section 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party acts unreasonably, but s 85A(2) does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1) 
 &#8226; the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order are left to the Court's discretion, which must be exercised judicially. However, the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs. 
 
 Costs in favour of non-parties

43 Mr Preston for the Kabi Kabi #2 Applicant submitted in summary:
 
 
 &#8226; any consideration of an award of costs on the discontinuance of the 29 June 2006 notice of motion must occur in light of s 85A of the Act 
 &#8226; as made clear in Ward [1999] FCA 580 ; 93 FCR 305 and De Rose [2005] FCAFC 137 
 
 
 
 
 o the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs unless the Court determines that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs

 o section 85A(2) does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/178.html</AustLII>
<text>8 To the extent that there is overlap with respect to the operation of s 84C and O 20 r 2 in the context of native title cases, I note that:
 
 
 &#8226; unlike O 20 r 2 which applies generally, s 84C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act 
 &#8226; section 84C applies where an application does not comply with ss 61 , 61A or 62 , whereas O 20 r 2 is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or the proceeding is an abuse of process
 &#8226; the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike-out under s 84C with those of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 at [48] - [49] . Accordingly the Courts approach such matters with caution, and on the basis that no court proceeding should be summarily dismissed except in a very clear case: Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 89.</text>
