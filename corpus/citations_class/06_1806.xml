<tocase>Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB [1985] AC 191 </tocase>
<text>103 In my opinion Monster's construction would lead to a result contrary to common sense (cf: Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 400 citing Oliver LJ in Exxon Corporation v Exxon Insurance Ltd [1982] Ch 119 at 144 where recourse to commonsense in construing an expression in a statute was allowed). A similar approach is apposite in construing agreements: cp: Miramar Maritime Corporation v Holborn Oil Trading Ltd [1984] AC 676 at 682E-F per Lord Diplock). As Lord Diplock said in Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB [1985] AC 191 at 201E:
 
 '... if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to yield to business commonsense'.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/18.html</AustLII>
<text>144 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 the High Court considered the incorporation into s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) the concept of unconscionability in the unwritten law. While s 51AC is a separate and freestanding statutory provision, the word 'unconscionable' is undefined in both s 51AA and s 51AC. The latter section identifies a range of factors to which the Court may have regard in considering whether in all the circumstances the relevant conduct is unconscionable. The factors identified in s 51AC(3) are, of course, not exhaustive, but they have similarities to the features of unconscionability or unconscientious behaviour identified in decisions of Blomley v Ryan [1954] HCA 79 ; (1956) 99 CLR 362 and Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio [1983] HCA 14 ; (1983) 151 CLR 447. In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at 64 [11] Gleeson CJ observed that a person was not in a position of relevant disadvantage simply because of inequality of bargaining powers. He said that many, perhaps even most, contracts are made between parties of unequal bargaining power, and good conscience does not require parties to contractual negotiations to forfeit their advantages, or neglect their own interests. And the Chief Justice continued that unconscientious exploitation or another's inability, or diminished ability, to conserve his or her own interests is not to be confused with taking advantage of a superior bargaining position for the purposes of s 51AA (214 CLR at 64 [14]).

145 However, a difference in bargaining positions is a factor which is one of the relevant circumstances that can be taken into account under s 51AC(3)(a). In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at 65 [15] - [16] , Gleeson CJ pointed out that the critical disadvantage from which the lessees in that case suffered was that they had no legal entitlement to a renewal or extension of the lease; that depended upon the lessors' willingness to grant such rights. In that context there was a compulsion to deal with the lessors which created a distinct disadvantage on the lessees, but not such as to attract the unwritten law of unconscionability to their position. As Gleeson CJ said:
 
 'It is an everyday occurrence in negotiations for settlement of legal disputes that, as a term of settlement, one party will be required to abandon claims which may or may not be related to the principal matter in issue.' 
 

He said that parties to commercial negotiations frequently use their bargaining power to 'extract' concessions from other parties but that was the stuff of ordinary commercial dealings (see too per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 214 CLR at 76-77 [55]-[57] and Callinan J at 112-115 [172]-[185]).

146 Monster gave no explanation for its failure to accept the offer of new IVR licences in the period following 28 October 2005. Nor did it identify any conduct of APRA and AMCOS as being unconscionable while Monster did not reply to the 28 October 2005 letter. Monster saw its own interests were served by it not pursuing that matter. That only changed on 31 January 2006 when APRA and AMCOS made a threat to commence proceedings if Monster did not pay what they said was due by 8 February, the day after the letter of 7 February 2006 was sent.

147 I do not see any element of unconscientiousness or moral obloquy on the part of APRA and AMCOS in this situation. Monster was advised by solicitors. Mr Chong was well able to make commercial decisions in what he saw as being Monster's and his own best interests. For Monster's and his own reasons, about which he gave no evidence, he chose not to take up the offer of new IVR licences at a time when it was obvious APRA and AMCOS were prepared to grant them in late October 2005. And, because Monster had no licences, and was not continuing to trade without them, APRA and AMCOS were entitled to act as they did in seeking to enforce their rights to prevent infringement of copyrights in which they were interested.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1957/90.html</AustLII>
<text>71 The use of the concept of agency to overcome the need for privity is a technique which was described in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 193 [79] by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ adopting the words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill (in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd [2003] UKHL 12 ; [2004] 1 AC 715 at 744) as 'a deft and commercially-inspired response to technical English rules of contract, particularly those governing privity and consideration'. As their Honours went on to note in the case of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause against a consignee of damaged cargo, courts have been ready to conclude that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority. As Lord Wilberforce said in his classic opinion in New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd [1975] AC 154 at 167E, the law of contract takes a practical approach in commercial situations '... often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the slots of offer, acceptance and consideration'. Even if Monster be correct to say that at the end of the day it received a lesser sum than that which the customer paid for the download, that was a result of Monster entering into arrangements with the telecommunications networks, perhaps on behalf of the customer or perhaps on its own behalf, it matters not, for the purposes of ensuring that the customer bought the download at the overall price Monster advertised that it was charging.

128 Monster argued that the offer of 28 October 2005 was open to be accepted over three months later on 7 February 2006. In general, the law implies that when no time limit for the exercise of a right is stipulated, the right may be exercised within a reasonable time unless there are indications to the contrary: Reid v Moreland Timber Co Pty Limited [1946] HCA 48 ; (1946) 73 CLR 1 at 13 per Dixon J. I am of opinion that this statement of the rule, coming from a case in contract, is just as applicable to a case where an offer to enter into a contract is made. Ordinarily in contract, absent an express provision to the contrary, where no time is fixed for performance, the parties are, or the party upon whom the obligation is cast is, obliged to perform within a reasonable time: see e.g. Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Limited [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 545-546 per Gibbs CJ, 567 per Brennan J (with whom Stephen J agreed). And, in Ballas v Theophilos [No 2] [1957] HCA 90 ; (1957) 98 CLR 193 at 197 Dixon CJ (with whom McTiernan J agreed) said that the implication of law, where a partnership deed limited no time for the exercise of an option, is that the option had to be exercised within a reasonable time. Dixon J observed that the stipulations contained in the relevant clause itself affected what a reasonable time was. Williams J, came to a like conclusion (at 98 CLR at 199).

134 The rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined by a reference to what each party by words or conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe ( Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ). I am of opinion that the same principle should be applied to the evaluation of whether an offer, the acceptance of which would bring the parties into an actual contractual relationship, is capable of acceptance. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the offer of 28 October 2005 as not remaining open for an indefinite time. Such a person would have said on 7 February 2006 that the offer of 28 October 2006 had lapsed some considerable time before.</text>

<text>105 Monster submitted that this was not an available approach to construction and that I was bound to follow what it argued was the different approach in Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420. In that case, of course, there was an obvious mistake. The question was how should the Court construe the language used. McTiernan, Webb and Taylor JJ said (95 CLR at 437):
 
 'It is trite law that an instrument must be construed as a whole. Indeed it is the only method by which inconsistencies of expression may be reconciled and it is in this natural and commonsense approach to problems of construction that justification is to be found for the rejection of repugnant words, the transposition of words and the supplying of omitted words (cf. Norton on Deeds 2 nd ed (1928) p 98)' (emphasis added)</text>

<tocase>L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 </tocase>
<text>104 Lord Reid once said that in arriving at the proper construction of a contract:
 
 'The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear: L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 at 251E.'

106 Their Honours' approach is not inconsistent with Lord Reid's or Lord Diplock's approaches. After all, the purpose of construction of contracts is to ascertain by reference to the words used in the factual matrix in which the parties dealt with one another what an objective person would reasonably understand the parties to have intended. And, as Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2002] HCA 5 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 at 439 [10] ; [2002] HCA 5 ; 186 ALR 289 at 293:
 
 ' [10] In Codelfa , Mason J (with whose judgment Stephen J and Wilson J agreed) referred to authorities (In particular, speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381 at 1381-1383-1385; [1971] 3 All ER 237 at 239-241; L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 at 261; and Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-997; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574-576) which indicated that, even in respect of agreements under seal, it is appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question were used and, from those circumstances, to discern the objective which the parties had in view. In particular, an appreciation of the commercial purpose of a contract: ( Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574) 
 
 
 
 "... presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating." 
 
 
 
 Such statements exemplify the point made by Brennan J in his judgment in Codelfa: ((1982) [1982] HCA 24 ; 149 CLR 337 at 401) 
 
 
 
 "The meaning of a written contract may be illuminated by evidence of facts to which the writing refers, for the symbols of language convey meaning according to the circumstances in which they are used."'</text>

<tocase>Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88</tocase>
<text>198 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 93A-B, Burchett J (with whom Lehane J agreed at 104F) applied an earlier statement he had made in Autodesk Inc v Yee (1996) 68 FCR 391 at 394 that in Australia additional damages may be given upon principles corresponding to those governing awards of aggravated and also exemplary damages at common law. He said that the Act had objectives other than compensation (75 FCR at 93E-F). Each of the factors referred to in s 115(4)(b) is sufficient in itself to sustain an award of additional damages. It is not necessary that each of them must be proved, rather that the relevant conduct of the defendant or respondent in the circumstances warrants an award. Tamberlin J came to a similar conclusion (75 FCR at 102E-104E). He noted the importance of preserving a broad unfettered discretion in relation to additional damages so far as quantum was concerned (75 FCR at 104D) and, that broad discretion should not be formulated in any arithmetic or mechanical way (75 FCR at 104C). I do not think that this is a case of mere mistake or neglect (75 FCR at 93C; Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 70; (1975) 12 ALR 685 at 90).

200 I think that Mr Chong's attitude, which was also Monster's, towards the non-payment of royalties to APRA and AMCOS was quite flagrant. Mr Chong thought he could get away without paying for what was due just as he did with trying to get away with using other people's rights without having first made any, let alone, proper arrangements for their use. I think there should be an appropriate marking of the Court's disapproval by a significant award (see Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 102-103; cp: Australian Performing Right Association Ltd v Pashalidis (2000) 48 IPR 610 at 619 [32] per Moore J).

201 Monster's and Mr Chong's conduct merits a substantial amount of additional damages being awarded so as to mark disapproval of its infringing conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar behaviour. During the 3 year period to 30 June 2006 Monster's total revenues from all its telecommunications service providers accounts total over $19 million. These include considerable revenues generated by the infringements. But the use of ringtone downloads was a means of attracting Monster's customers to all its advertised products. In my opinion, on the basis of my findings, I should fix the amount of additional damages at $100,000.</text>

<tocase>Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1</tocase>
<text>13 A ringtone is a fragment of a musical work in digital form which is intended to be delivered to and to function as the ring of a mobile telephone: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1 at 3 [9] per Lindgren P. The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers, a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone, the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones (s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act: s 10(1) contains a definition of the word 'communicate' as meaning to 'make available online or electronically transmit ... a work or other subject matter'). By providing an IVR service, a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer's mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them (for the purposes of s 36 of the Act) (175 FLR at 4 [11]-[13]).

14 Relevantly, each of the SMS licences dated 1 January 2005 is in identical terms, except for the fees payable under Schedule 1, the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works (cl 5). Each SMS licence commenced on 1 October 2004 (cl 3). APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of 1.1% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 1.65cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. The fee for phonographic format (i.e. MP3) ringtones was 2.2% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of $3.30 per sale. At all times, Monster charged consumers, according to its advertisements $3.50 per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service.

15 AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of $11 in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee's inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable. In addition, the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of 11% inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 16.5cents (inclusive of GST) per sale.

149 I am of opinion that no such order should be made. Monster has committed serious breaches of the IVR and SMS licences in the past. I do not think that it is appropriate to force APRA and AMCOS into a contractual relationship in the circumstances. I am not satisfied that they would not negotiate the granting of new licences to Monster in good faith. If Monster cannot obtain in such negotiations new licences from APRA, the Copyright Tribunal has power to settle their terms. That power may also extend to the AMCOS licences in circumstances such as the present: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR at 8-9 [26]-[31] per Lindgren P.

150 Monster was unlicensed from 18 August 2005 in respect of IVR services and from 13 December in respect of SMS services. It is liable to APRA and AMCOS for damages for infringement. APRA and AMCOS exercised their election to claim damages rather than an account of profits. It is agreed that the appropriate sum by which compensatory damages should be fixed is what would have been payable under the licences had Monster been licensed. That is a reasonable approach and I will adopt it.

151 Mr Mallett identified four licensees of ringtones from APRA and AMCOS which he said were comparable to the business operated by Monster. The trading names of the licensees were Jamster, Bugal, Blue Sky Frog and Powercom. He concluded that the proportions of ringtone downloads of all downloads in each of those competitors' businesses over the periods he examined were between 40.94% and 66.17%. This was based on the amount of licence fees paid to APRA and AMCOS by each of those licensees during the relevant licence periods. Mr Mallett estimated, based on his comparison with the four competitors, about 41.31% of Monster's revenue over its period of trading was attributable to ringtone services. This led to a claim that total licence fees due to 30 June 2006 were $1 million of which only about $315,000 had been paid.</text>

<text>128 Monster argued that the offer of 28 October 2005 was open to be accepted over three months later on 7 February 2006. In general, the law implies that when no time limit for the exercise of a right is stipulated, the right may be exercised within a reasonable time unless there are indications to the contrary: Reid v Moreland Timber Co Pty Limited [1946] HCA 48 ; (1946) 73 CLR 1 at 13 per Dixon J. I am of opinion that this statement of the rule, coming from a case in contract, is just as applicable to a case where an offer to enter into a contract is made. Ordinarily in contract, absent an express provision to the contrary, where no time is fixed for performance, the parties are, or the party upon whom the obligation is cast is, obliged to perform within a reasonable time: see e.g. Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Limited [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 545-546 per Gibbs CJ, 567 per Brennan J (with whom Stephen J agreed). And, in Ballas v Theophilos [No 2] [1957] HCA 90 ; (1957) 98 CLR 193 at 197 Dixon CJ (with whom McTiernan J agreed) said that the implication of law, where a partnership deed limited no time for the exercise of an option, is that the option had to be exercised within a reasonable time. Dixon J observed that the stipulations contained in the relevant clause itself affected what a reasonable time was. Williams J, came to a like conclusion (at 98 CLR at 199).</text>

<text>106 Their Honours' approach is not inconsistent with Lord Reid's or Lord Diplock's approaches. After all, the purpose of construction of contracts is to ascertain by reference to the words used in the factual matrix in which the parties dealt with one another what an objective person would reasonably understand the parties to have intended. And, as Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2002] HCA 5 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 at 439 [10] ; [2002] HCA 5 ; 186 ALR 289 at 293:
 
 ' [10] In Codelfa , Mason J (with whose judgment Stephen J and Wilson J agreed) referred to authorities (In particular, speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381 at 1381-1383-1385; [1971] 3 All ER 237 at 239-241; L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 at 261; and Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-997; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574-576) which indicated that, even in respect of agreements under seal, it is appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question were used and, from those circumstances, to discern the objective which the parties had in view. In particular, an appreciation of the commercial purpose of a contract: ( Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574) 
 
 
 
 "... presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating." 
 
 
 
 Such statements exemplify the point made by Brennan J in his judgment in Codelfa: ((1982) [1982] HCA 24 ; 149 CLR 337 at 401) 
 
 
 
 "The meaning of a written contract may be illuminated by evidence of facts to which the writing refers, for the symbols of language convey meaning according to the circumstances in which they are used."'</text>

<tocase>Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/52.html</AustLII>
<text>71 The use of the concept of agency to overcome the need for privity is a technique which was described in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 193 [79] by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ adopting the words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill (in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd [2003] UKHL 12 ; [2004] 1 AC 715 at 744) as 'a deft and commercially-inspired response to technical English rules of contract, particularly those governing privity and consideration'. As their Honours went on to note in the case of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause against a consignee of damaged cargo, courts have been ready to conclude that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority. As Lord Wilberforce said in his classic opinion in New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd [1975] AC 154 at 167E, the law of contract takes a practical approach in commercial situations '... often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the slots of offer, acceptance and consideration'. Even if Monster be correct to say that at the end of the day it received a lesser sum than that which the customer paid for the download, that was a result of Monster entering into arrangements with the telecommunications networks, perhaps on behalf of the customer or perhaps on its own behalf, it matters not, for the purposes of ensuring that the customer bought the download at the overall price Monster advertised that it was charging.

134 The rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined by a reference to what each party by words or conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe ( Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ). I am of opinion that the same principle should be applied to the evaluation of whether an offer, the acceptance of which would bring the parties into an actual contractual relationship, is capable of acceptance. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the offer of 28 October 2005 as not remaining open for an indefinite time. Such a person would have said on 7 February 2006 that the offer of 28 October 2006 had lapsed some considerable time before.</text>

<text>203 I am satisfied that there is a real risk that Monster and Mr Chong will continue to infringe APRA's and AMCOS' copyrights unless restrained. It is appropriate to grant injunctive relief to prevent Monster's continuing infringements: Universal Music Australia Pty Limited v Cooper [2005] FCA 1878 at [13] .

204 Having regard to my findings, it is necessary for calculations to be made as to the precise sums to be awarded by way of damages. I will direct the applicants to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to my reasons. This will allow the respondents to check the calculation of any royalties. It follows that the respondents should pay the applicants' costs.

 I certify that the preceding two hundred and four (204) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<text>202 An award of additional damages should not impose a punishment greater than would be imposed if the conduct were criminal ( XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 12 ; (1985) 155 CLR 448 at 463 per Gibbs J). The defendant's financial circumstances are a relevant consideration ( XL 155 CLR at 461 per Gibbs CJ, 472 per Brennan J) as has been the period of the conduct and its circumstances.</text>

<text>67 A commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable APRA and AMCOS to receive a percentage of the earnings of those seeking to exploit copyright works over which they had rights. The SMS licences authorized Monster to use telecommunications networks to communicate and reproduce the copyright ringtone. In ordinary English usage, 'retail price' is the amount paid by the customer for the goods or service. It is not the net amount the retailer receives after paying a sum not disclosed to the customer for the right to sell the goods or service. The term 'retail price' should be construed so as to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ said in Zhu v Treasurer of NSW [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] . They also said that the commercial purpose of reasonable persons in the position of the parties was relevant, as were the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context and the market in which the parties were operating, as known to each of them (218 CLR at 559 [82]).

68 A significant commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable the whole download procedure to be authorised by the licensors and for the money generated by the exploitation of the rights they granted to be used as the basis for calculating the royalty fee due respectively to each of APRA and AMCOS.

69 Moreover, it would be a very odd construction of the ordinary English language term 'retail price' to divorce the price advertised by Monster to the public as the price payable for the download, from the price on which Monster was liable to account for royalties. Monster organised through its various telecommunication contracts and licences with APRA and AMCOS, a situation in which members of the public could use their own telephones to obtain a service Monster had for sale. Monster contracted with the public by offering to sell the SMS download to them for the price of $3.50 in its advertisements. That involved Monster becoming an agent, or using agents, to ensure that the transaction was carried out so the consumer received that for which he or she paid. Monster needed to charge its customer a price to cover its costs of delivering the download.

108 It is necessary to construe an agreement so as to avoid making it commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience. The commercial purpose of the definitions, that is to say the purpose of a reasonable person in the position of the parties to the contract, is relevant. That in turn requires attention to the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties were operating, as known to both parties: Zhu v Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] .

109 Accordingly, the $0.003 per second and non-telecommunications service charges should not be deducted from net call revenue.

110 APRA and AMCOS say they were entitled to terminate the IVR licences because the interim fees invoiced after the audit were not paid within 14 days. By cll 6.2 and 6.3 of the APRA IVR licence (cll 7.2 and 7.3 of the AMCOS one) Monster had to pay any invoice issued by the licensor within 14 days after the date of the invoice. An invoice for additional licence fees issued after APRA received information under cl 8 (cl 9 of the AMCOS IVR licence) had also to be paid within this time (cll 6.3 and 7.3 respectively).</text>
