<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) 185 ALR 609</tocase>
<text>24 I have already noted that the Tribunal sent to the appellant the s 424A letter. This was done before the decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) 185 ALR 609. In any event, it cannot be said that there was any failure to comply with any obligation that may have existed on the part of the Tribunal. The Tribunal set out all of the particulars of the matters of concern, explained to the appellant why those matters were of concern and gave the appellant the opportunity to respond. The introduction included the independent country information that the Tribunal had consulted concerning the Construction Corporation and its activities and a major earthquake that took place in the north of Jiangxi Province at a relevant time. That information comes within s 424A(3)(a) of the Act. In any event, the Tribunal put all of the material to the appellant and I can see no breach of s 424A(1).

25 During the hearing the appellant raised an allegation that the Tribunal failed to give him the opportunity to present all of his material. Specifically, he says that he was not given enough time to present his case to the Tribunal member. There is no evidence to support that allegation and I note that it was not made to Scarlett FM. As I have said, the Tribunal gave a very detailed discussion of all of the matters put to it, not only from the written material provided by the appellant but also from the oral evidence. The Tribunal's account of the hearing describes a detailed number of questions put to the appellant and responses from him. This indicates that the Tribunal member took the time to question the appellant during the course of the hearing. In addition, the hearing notes of the Tribunal, which are in evidence, indicate that the hearing took place over two and a half hours. I am not satisfied that the Tribunal improperly shortened the hearing or failed to give the appellant the opportunity to present his case.

26 I am not satisfied that any of the grounds of appeal, either as raised in the written notice of appeal or as raised at the hearing of this appeal, have been made out. I do not see that there has been any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal or any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. It follows that the appeal should be dismissed.</text>

<tocase>SZKRK v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1384</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/1384.html</AustLII>
<text>5 The appellant's application for judicial review came before Scarlett FM ( SZKRK v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1384).

6 Three grounds were considered by his Honour. The first ground was that the Tribunal ignored or failed to consider important evidence submitted after the hearing, namely the appellant's reply to the s 424A letter (at [12]). His Honour concluded that the Tribunal did consider the material (at [17]).

7 The second ground was that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s 424A(1) of the Act (at [13]). His Honour concluded that the independent country information appeared to him to come within s 424A(3)(a) of the Act (at [18]) but noted that, in any event, all of the material was put to the appellant after the hearing in the s 424A letter (at [19]).

8 The appellant also alleged that there was bias or bad faith on the part of the Tribunal (at [20]). His Honour found that there was no evidence to support such an allegation, which, as he noted, must be strictly alleged and strictly proved and he declined to make a finding in that regard (at [20]).

9 The third ground was the appellant's claim that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s 425 of the Act (at [14]). His Honour could not find any such breach of the obligations under that section (at [21]).

10 His Honour considered each of the matters in the application and noted that he had himself read the decision and supporting materials and could not identify any other arguable ground of review. His Honour was satisfied that there was no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision (at [17]).

11 The notice of appeal reflects the substance of the grounds that were raised before Scarlett FM. They are described as particulars of two grounds, being a claim that the Federal Magistrate erred in law and an assertion that the Federal Magistrate was wrong in his finding that the Tribunal acted properly.

12 The first particular asserts that the Tribunal ignored important evidence. What follows is a repeat of the appellant's response to the s 424A letter. No specific evidence is pointed to.

13 To the extent that this particular raises an attempt at merits review, that is not a matter for the Court. I do not see any matter raised in the response with which the Tribunal did not deal. The appellant, who appears before me in person assisted by an interpreter, has not pointed to any evidence set out in the particulars of his notice of appeal that he can say the Tribunal did not deal with.

14 The appellant now raises one additional matter. He claims that he was tortured while in detention and that he has physical scars that reflect that torture. He says that he did not show the scars to the Tribunal for what seems to be two reasons. First, he was not sure if it was appropriate to show the scars to the female Tribunal member. Secondly, he asserts that he wished to show those scars to the Tribunal member but that she did not give him the time or the opportunity to do so. I will return to the second matter.

15 If the appellant did not show the scars to the Tribunal member or make allegations specifically of torture, then it was not a claim made to the Tribunal and the Tribunal was not obliged to address it. Indeed, the Tribunal would not have known about it. I note that there is no reference to a claim of torture in the statutory declaration in support of his application for a protection visa, in the Tribunal's recitation of the case put by the appellant in writing or orally in the Tribunal, in the s 424A letter or in the Federal Magistrate's reasons. This is despite the fact that the appellant did set out in his written material what he said were the indices of his treatment while in detention.

16 There is no transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal in evidence that would assist in ascertaining whether or not the appellant attempted to make such a claim to the Tribunal. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that such a claim was made.

17 The second particular is simply an assertion that the Federal Magistrate erred in his conclusion that at least one of the appellant's claims was an attempt to conduct a merit review. This particular does not really represent a ground of appeal. I see it as a particular of the general ground that the Federal Magistrate erred in law.</text>

<text>21 To the extent that this particular may also assert illogicality or irrationality on the part of the Tribunal, such a ground is not made out. In any event, mere illogical reasoning does not of itself constitute jurisdictional error ( NACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [30] ; VWST v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 286 at [18] ).</text>
