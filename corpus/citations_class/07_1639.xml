<tocase>Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/23.html</AustLII>
<text>55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .</text>

<tocase>Adamson v West Perth Football Club (1979) 27 ALR 475</tocase>
<text>138 Although the term "competitor" has received no judicial attention that I can identify, the word "competition" has, in the context of Pt IV TPA. So in Adamson v West Perth Football Club (1979) 27 ALR 475 at 502, Northrop J said:
 
 "When used in s 45 of the Act, the word is used in a commercial or economic sense. Thus in order to have competition in a market, there must be substitution between one product and another and between one source of supply and another in response to changing prices or the quality of the product being supplied."

139 I have already expressed the view that the respondent is not "carrying on a business" within the meaning of s 2B TPA in relation to its supply of data in response to individual searches, which forms the primary activity of the respondent in the Retail Market. If the respondent is not carrying on a business, the question immediately arises whether the respondent is capable of being a "competitor" of the applicant in the Retail Market for the purposes of s 46(1)(a), in respect of this particular conduct of the respondent. In my opinion, the obvious answer in this case is that the respondent is not the respondent is fulfilling a statutory function in supplying that data, and is subject to legislative control in respect of prices charged and product quality. There are, however, some elements of "competition" as between the applicant and the respondent as submitted by the applicant, particularly in relation to issues of product substitution. In the event that I am in error in relation to whether the respondent is carrying on a business in relation to its supply of data, then as I have done elsewhere in this judgment I propose to continue to consider whether, within the meaning of s 46(1)(a), the applicant is a "competitor" of the respondent in the Retail Market.

140 Further, I have also said that the evidence before me does not support a finding that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market. Irrespective whether the respondent has any power in the Retail Market flowing from its power in the Wholesale Market as a monopoly supplier, this does not equate to the respondent being a "competitor" of the applicant in the Retail Market.

141 To date the activities of the applicant and the respondent have been at different points on an economic continuum, with different product offerings, different levels of sophistication of products, different client bases, and apparently minimal overlap. The value-added products of the applicant appear to have little in common with such products of the respondent as SmartMap, or the raw data supplied in response to statutory searches. The applicant and the respondent have not been "rivals" in the Retail Market in the sense of being entities who strive to outdo each other (see discussion by Professor Stephen Corones Competition Law in Australia (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2007) at 5. Nor, as the respondent submitted with reference to statements of Mr Catelan and the applicant in its Information Memorandum, does the applicant perceive the respondent as its competitor in the Retail Market.

142 Nonetheless there is commonality in the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market in that both supply data sourced from the respondent, and it appears that the Excluded Data at present can be obtained by customers of the applicant from either the applicant or the respondent. In that sense there is presently the potential of substitution between one source of supply and another of that data as contemplated in Adamson . Although the competition appears in the present environment to be minimal, leaving aside for the moment issues arising out of s 2B TPA, I am prepared to assume that the applicant is a "competitor" of the respondent in the Retail Market.
 Can the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant as a competitor in the Retail Market be inferred?

143 However, irrespective whether applicant and the respondent are competitors in the Retail Market, in my view the alleged purpose of the respondent as claimed by the applicant is neither demonstrated by the evidence, nor can it be inferred from the respondent's conduct. In fact, the evidence demonstrates unambiguously that the purpose claimed by the respondent in engaging in the conduct the subject of complaint was in truth its purpose. This is so on any view of the meaning of the word "purpose", and regardless whether the interpretation submitted by the applicant or the respondent as to the meaning of "purpose" in s 46(1) is accepted. The object in view or sought to be achieved by the conduct of the respondent was clearly to ensure that Collected Data could not be used by anyone for the purpose of direct marketing to consumers. It was for this reason, and this reason alone, that the respondent took advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market. This purpose is not a proscribed purpose within the meaning of s 46(1)(a) TPA. The respondent did not engage in the relevant conduct for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant as a competitor in the Retail Market.

144 I form this view for the following reasons, taking into consideration relevant submissions of the applicant in relation to this claim.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd (2007) 237 ALR 512</tocase>
<text>52 Section 46 is found in Pt IV TPA. However the extended application only operates if the Crown in right of the relevant State or Territory is carrying on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State of Territory. As is clear from such cases as NT Power 219 CLR (particularly at 116) and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd (2007) 237 ALR 512 (particularly at 526-527), this condition is strictly applied.

158 Section 46(1)(c) must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA. As pointed out by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway 205 CLR at 13).
 
 "Section 46 aims to promote competition, not the private interests of particular persons or corporations."
 

(cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.

160 First, while I accept that, as a result of the respondent's proposal, the applicant will not be able to continue to provide services to its customers which include the Excluded Data, and that this may impact upon the business of the applicant as claimed in para 9(b) of the amended statement of claim, the applicant must demonstrate more than this effect to show that the purpose of the respondent's conduct was in breach of s 46(1)(c). As pointed out by Lee J in NT Power Generation v Power &amp; Water Authority [2002] FCAFC 302 at [17] , although the effect of conduct may, in some circumstances, explain or reveal the purpose of the conduct, the inference may be negated by other material relevant to the issue of purpose (cf Photo-Continental Pty Ltd v Sony (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-372 at 40,122-40,123). It is the purposeful conduct of the contravening corporation that attracts the operation of s 46(1)(c): Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 519.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Boral Ltd (1999) 166 ALR 410</tocase>
<text>97 However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, and subsequently reiterated by the majority of the High Court in Melway 205 CLR at 17, "take advantage of" does not mean anything materially different from "use" and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy: per Mason CJ and Wilson J at 191, Deane J at 194, Dawson J at 198, Toohey J at 212-214 (cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 at [137] ). In terms of s 46 it does, however, entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment, and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s 46. So, as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd (1999) 166 ALR 410 (at 440), subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374 (at 434):
 
 "If the impugned conduct has a business rationale, that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power."

113 So, to paraphrase Heerey J in ACCC v Boral 166 ALR 410 as adopted by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374, was the conduct of the respondent taking advantage of its market power in withdrawing the supply of the Excluded Data, such that an entity with no substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market would not, as a matter of commercial judgment, engage in that conduct?</text>

<text>159 However, notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, I am not persuaded that the purpose of the respondent was to deter or prevent the applicant from engaging in conduct which was competitive with the conduct of the respondent when it discharged its statutory function of providing names and addresses in response to statutory searches in the Retail Market. Similarly, it cannot be said that the proposal of the respondent had the purpose of deterring or preventing the applicant from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market to the benefit of other licensees the proposal to exclude the Excluded Data from the data supplied by the respondent was identical in respect of all licensees. So, for example, in my view the purpose of the respondent in this case was not to gain a competitive advantage in the Retail Market over the applicant in relation to the Excluded Data or to deter the applicant from discounting prices of its product to competitors of the respondent (cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 149 ; (2003) 129 FCR 339 at 355-356.

<text>88 However, with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. In particular, I note the following:
 
&#8226; In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement, the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that, because of the respondent's substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market, "it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market". The respondent points out however, that the experts do not say that the respondent has a "substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market. This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent's substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market. Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market (TS p 88 ll 40-42) and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (TS p 78 ll 3-4).
 
&#8226; Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a "downstream" retail market is a relatively common phenomenon, and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court, for example, in the context of claims of alleged anti-competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493) , in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA ( Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146) , and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( Australian Gas Light Company (ACN 052 167 405) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (No 3) [2003] FCA 1525). However, the ability of an entity to "substantially influence patterns of competition" in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market, as agreed by the experts, is not, in my view, necessarily tantamount to "a substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market or even, as submitted by the respondent, "market power" within the meaning of the s 46 TPA.
 
&#8226; As I have already noted, the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different, supplying different services to different customers. It is not in contention before me that there is "a" Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information. However, whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product, it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base, namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant's services, as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter. It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market (RP Data Information Memorandum Document 1 pp 14, 15; evidence of Mr Catelan TS p 57 ll 37-42). In this respect, the "market power" of the respondent in the Retail Market, viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market, is not obvious. Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end-users, it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 158.
 
&#8226; I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 
&#8226; I also note that:
 
 
 o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement (TS p 2 ll 1-14, p 7 ll 19-23), Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market
 o Mr Jackson QC, in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market, confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts, and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market. 
 

&#8226; I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement, I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; As pointed out in Queensland Wire , the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing, barriers to entry, market share. However in this case I note, for example, that:
 
 
 a. no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent
 b. although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent, there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers
 c. no evidence is lead as to market share (if any) in the Retail Market held by the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Ceridale Pty Ltd (1990) 97 ALR 497</tocase>
<text>169 A number of submissions were made the respondent in relation to these claims. In particular:
 
1. The respondent's proposal to withdraw the Excluded Data from the Collected Data supplied to licensees does not prevent real estate agents from engaging in direct marketing. The proposal merely prevents persons, including real estate agents, from using data collected by the Department being used for purposes other than those contemplated by ss 77(3) and (3A) VL Act . There is no deterrence on real estate agents and others direct marketing by, for example, newsletter drops, newsletters and so on.
 
2. Evidence of witnesses of the respondent was that the purpose of the respondent was to try and stop direct marketing using the Department's data-sets rather than stop direct marketing activities of real estate agents per se . So, for example, at the hearing, evidence of Mr Rush was as follows:
 
 
 "And specifically, you wanted to stop direct marketing by real estate agents?--- I wanted to stop direct marketing using government sourced information."
 
 
 
 Similarly, Mr Fry gave evidence as follows: (TS p 200 ll 19-23) 
 
 
 "But how do you know that it's going to stop direct marketing by simply taking it out of the hands of the six licensees who you've licensed to obtain bulk data --- We're not saying we are trying to stop direct marketing in total. We are saying we are trying to stop direct marketing using this data set from our Department." (TS p 334 l 25)
 
 

3. On the evidence there appears to be no prohibition on anyone using information obtained directly from either the respondent or a third party (for example, local government authorities) in direct marketing activities. The effect of the prohibition is that a person cannot use for direct marketing purposes information obtained through a distributor such as the applicant.
 
4. A distinction needs to be made between the purpose of the proposal of the respondent and the effect of it if implemented. The sole purpose of the Department is the prevention of the misuse of the Excluded Data and the protection of privacy of individuals and businesses that have provided, compulsorily, information to the respondent. The proposal, if implemented, may have the effect of preventing or deterring certain competitive conduct such as direct marketing, by closing off one source of names and addresses, but that the proposal might have that effect is irrelevant if the purpose for its implementation was not to deter or prevent competition, which is the case here.
 
5. This case is no different to that encountered by the Full Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Ceridale Pty Ltd (1990) 97 ALR 497.
 
6. The respondent supplies a product, the QVAS database, which is compiled for purposes which do not include direct marketing. The respondent is entitled to prevent the misuse of its information for a purpose for which the information was not collected.
 
7. The licence agreement emphasises that data supplied may only be used for certain purposes. Clause 1.1 of the 2003 Licence states:
 
 
 "It's a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the licence data for the purposes specified in the agreement, subject to the terms and conditions."
 
 Further, cl 4.1.1 provides:
 "The agreement does not confer on the licensee any rights of ownership in the licensed data, and all intellectual property rights, including copyright in the licensed data, are unaffected by this agreement."

170 No evidence was produced at the trial demonstrating that real estate agents who are customers of the applicant and who engage in direct marketing activities utilise data sourced from the respondent. Indeed it would be difficult to produce such evidence it is clear from the terms of the 2003 Licence Agreement that the applicant is contractually obliged to ensure that its customers (including real estate agents) do not use the information for such purposes, and presumably any direct marketing activity engaged in by real estate agents who are customers of the applicant would be in breach of their own agreement with the applicant.

171 In my view the following issues are clear.

175 Third, while in the absence of evidence to the contrary I accept that the most likely persons affected in their direct marketing activities by the withdrawal of the Excluded Data would be real estate agents, I accept the respondent's submission that this is an effect rather than the purpose of the respondent's conduct. I also consider that principles articulated by the Full Court in Ceridale 97 ALR 497 are relevant here.

176 In Ceridale 97 ALR 497, the Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd ("APRA") owned copyright of public performances in nearly all current popular copyright music, and the respondents were all persons associated with premises within which the subject works had been performed without the licence of APRA. APRA would grant, inter alia , licences in respect of premises to play recorded music, the use of a background music system, and live performances with respect to works over which APRA held copyright. The respondents were persons associated with premises within which works over which APRA held copyright had been performed. The licence held by the first respondent was terminated by APRA on account of non-payment of outstanding licence fees. Further dispute between the parties led to APRA filing a notice of motion seeking summary judgment with injunctive relief. In relation to s 46 , his Honour said that APRA had the monopoly control over the market concerning the supply of the performing rights of music played to patrons in nightclubs and discotheques, and the refusal to grant a customer such as the defendants a licence which would enable the customer to obtain that commodity was plainly an exercise of market power (at 508-509). His Honour also found that it was no answer to a complaint of a contravention of s 46 that the corporation was only taking advantage of a legal right (at 509) and in this case the proper characterisation of APRA's actions was that it was taking advantage of its powers in the market to prevent the defendants from engaging in competitive conduct in another market simply in order to collect a disputed debt (at 509). The trial judge refused to grant an injunction, the object and effect of which was to force a business to pay a debt which was subject to a genuine dispute.

177 Wilcox, Spender and Pincus JJ allowed the appeal of APRA. In particular at 510-511 their Honours said:
 
 "There is no doubt, in the present case, that APRA enjoys a substantial degree of power amounting indeed to dominance in the market for music rights. It would seem that, in practical terms, it would be impossible for a nightclub or discotheque to survive without using music of the appellant. Accordingly, APRA is a corporation to which section 46 applies. But we are unable to agree that, upon the facts of this case, APRA has been guilty of any of the proscribed acts. The only suggested conduct was a contravention of para (c), that is that APRA had denied licences 'for the purpose of deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market'; the relevant 'person' being each of the respondents and the relevant 'other market' being the nightclub or discotheque market. We agree that the granting of an injunction might have the effect of preventing the respondents from competing in those markets. But there is no basis for saying that this was APRA's purpose. APRA had nothing to gain by putting the respondents out of business. On the contrary, it was in the interests of APRA to maximise the number of users of its material, so long as they paid licence fees. APRA's purpose was merely to prevent unauthorised use of its material and the integrity of its licensing system ." (emphasis added)

178 In my view the comments of their Honours I have italicised are of particular relevance in this case before me. The evidence is overwhelming that the purpose of the respondent was to prevent misuse of its database, in circumstances where legislatively supported contractual provisions in the licence agreements appear not to have been successful in preventing that misuse. Indeed, in my view it is fair to say that as a general proposition, provided they did not misuse Departmental data, the respondent had nothing to gain by deterring or preventing the participants in the Real Estate Agents' Services Markets from engaging in competitive conduct in those markets.

179 Fourth, irrespective whether during the 1990s the Department may have had no qualms concerning its database being used for direct marketing purposes by real estate agents as claimed by Mr Catelan (TS p 46 ll 44-46) and conceded by Mr Witt (TS p 222 ll 46-48 and p 223 ll 1-3), it appears that by October 2002 the Department was concerned about misuse of the data for direct marketing as a general proposition (for example, evidence of Mr Fry TS p 195 ll 13-14). This concern is reflected in the enactment of s 77(3A) VL Act , introduced into the VL Act in May 2003, which specifically required the inclusion in any contract for the supply of information a provision allowing the chief executive of the respondent to exclude particulars of valuation roll information if satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that inclusion of the particulars may result in the particulars being inappropriately disclosed or used. The clear purpose in the conduct of the respondent has been to ensure that the respondent's database should not be misused, by anyone . While real estate agents may be the most affected group, in my view this does not mean that the purpose of the respondent is to deter real estate agents engaging in competitive conduct in the relevant market.

180 A threshold issue in these proceedings was whether the respondent was bound at all by s 46 TPA, because it is not a "corporation" as required by that section. I formed the view early in this judgment that:
 
(a) conduct of the respondent in the Wholesale Market in supplying Collected Data to the applicants and others did constitute the carrying on of a business by the respondent for the purposes of s 2B TPA, with the result that the respondent was bound by s 46 in respect of this conduct; but
 
(b) the supply by the respondent of data in response to individual searches in the Retail Market was not subject to s 46 TPA because, in so doing, the respondent was not "carrying on a business" as contemplated by s 2B.

181 Although the respondent clearly has a substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market, and it did take advantage of that power, in my view it did not take advantage of that power for purposes proscribed by s 46(1) TPA.

182 Accordingly, the claim of the applicant fails, and is dismissed with costs.

 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 

 
 1. The application filed 18 March 2005 is dismissed.
 2. The applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the application, to be taxed if not otherwise agreed.

<tocase>Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/5.html</AustLII>
<text>65 The necessity for competition to exist before a "market" is constituted was emphasised in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374. As Gleeson CJ and Callinan J observed:
 
 "A market is an area of close competition; a field of rivalry. As the passage from Re Queensland Co-Operative Milling Association Ltd quoted above indicates, and as s 46(3) recognises, both the supply side and the demand side are relevant to an assessment of the market. It does not solve, but merely re-states, the problem to speak of sub-markets. There may be a wider, and a narrower, area of rivalry; but, if the narrowest area itself constitutes a market, then it is power and conduct in that area that must be examined." (at 422-423) (cf Deane J in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 195)

97 However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, and subsequently reiterated by the majority of the High Court in Melway 205 CLR at 17, "take advantage of" does not mean anything materially different from "use" and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy: per Mason CJ and Wilson J at 191, Deane J at 194, Dawson J at 198, Toohey J at 212-214 (cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 at [137] ). In terms of s 46 it does, however, entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment, and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s 46. So, as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd (1999) 166 ALR 410 (at 440), subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374 (at 434):
 
 "If the impugned conduct has a business rationale, that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power."

113 So, to paraphrase Heerey J in ACCC v Boral 166 ALR 410 as adopted by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374, was the conduct of the respondent taking advantage of its market power in withdrawing the supply of the Excluded Data, such that an entity with no substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market would not, as a matter of commercial judgment, engage in that conduct?

123 In relation to identifying the "purpose" of the respondent, as illustrated by the cases listed in Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act 28th edition para 1.46.65, the weight of authority indicates that the relevant purpose is to be identified on the basis of a subjective test rather than objectively, although purpose may be established by inference from the conduct of the respondent (s 46(7)). As Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire 167 CLR, the reference to "for the purpose of" carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve the result spoken of in each of the paragraphs in s 46(1) (at CLR 214). I note that the subjective nature of the relevant intent was also endorsed by the High Court in Boral Besser 215 CLR at 484.

158 Section 46(1)(c) must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA. As pointed out by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway 205 CLR at 13).
 
 "Section 46 aims to promote competition, not the private interests of particular persons or corporations."
 

(cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.</text>

<tocase>Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1280.html</AustLII>
<text>55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .</text>

<tocase>Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109</tocase>
<text>75 The notion of "market power" in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration. The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177. Usefully, Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109 at 138 summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 188-190 the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power:
 
 "(a) "the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time, supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product";
 (b) "the extent to which the conduct of [any of the respondents] in that market is constrained by the conduct of...competitors or potential competitors..." (s 46(3));
 (c) market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as "the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed" (Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co (1948) 334 US 495 at 528);
 (d) the presence of vertical integration is another factor, but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists; and
 (e) to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market? That is to say, what are the barriers to entry? It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power. See also the judgment of the Full Court of this court in Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission at FCR 336 9."

126 The respondent relied on comments of Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety 34 FCR at 143 where his Honour said that "purpose" in s 46 "is not concerned directly with the effect of conduct, but with the purpose in the sense of motivation and reason, though, as mentioned earlier, purpose may be inferred from conduct".

127 The applicant in para 10 of the amended statement of claim alleges that the respondent has so acted for the following purposes:
 
 "(a) for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging RP Data in the Market or the Retail Market
 (b) for the purpose of deterring or preventing RP Data from engaging in competitive conduct in the Market or the Retail Market
 Particulars 
 
 
 (i) The fact that the Department has this purpose is to be inferred from: 
 
 
 
 
 (A) the effect of the proposal as set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 hereof
 (B) the Department, through Colin Witt, has evinced an intention to harm and prevent RP Data competing in the market place by: 
 
 
 
 (I) offering Infopac favourable terms in order to compete with RP Data
 (II) informing John Edwards of Residex that the Department had an intention to reduce the cost of the Collected Data so as to break RP Data's monopoly 
 
 
 
 (C) Wayne Fry and Geoff Oakley on 4 February 2005 stating to Jane Woodward of RP Data that if RP Data did not agree to the new licence conditions that they would not receive any Collected Data in the future. 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) The purpose is that of the persons set out in paragraph 8 above
 (iii) The competitive conduct of RP Data which it is the Department's purpose to deter or prevent RP Data from engaging in is the provision electronically of the Collected Data including the Excluded Data: 
 
 
 
 
 (A) in competition with the Department
 (B) in competition with other licensees 
 
 
 
 (ba) for the purpose of deterring or preventing real estate agents from direct marketing to owners of real property using the Excluded Data
 (bb) for the purpose of deterring or preventing real estate agents thereby from engaging in competitive conduct in the Real Estate Agents' Services Markets."

128 The respondent in its amended defence denied that it has acted in the manner alleged by the applicant, and states in para 42 that its purpose in proposing to exclude the Excluded Data from the Collected Data available under future licences is to ensure that such information in bulk data form is not available for direct marketing purposes.</text>

<tocase>Eastern Express Pty Ltd v General Newspapers Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 43</tocase>
<text>79 The reference in s 46(1) to a "substantial degree" of market power was considered by the Full Court in Eastern Express Pty Ltd v General Newspapers Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 43 at 63 where Lockhart and Gummow JJ said:
 
 "For a corporation to have a substantial degree of market power it must have a considerable or large degree of such power. The difficulty lies not in defining the word 'substantial' but in applying the concept of a substantial degree of market power to the circumstances of each case and in identifying whether the requisite degree of market power exists. This is a relative concept." (cf Wilcox, French and Gyles JJ in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 193 ; (2003) 131 FCR 529 at 564-565.

80 Finally, as was explained in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1985 Explanatory Memorandum:
 
&#8226; "Market power" is a recognised economic concept which has been subject to considerable analysis in economic literature (at [40]).
 
&#8226; The use of the word "degree" in the expression "degree of power in a market" reflects the fact that "market power" is a relative concept. All participants in a market possess a degree of market power which may range from negligible to very great (at [41]).
 
&#8226; The circumstances which give rise to absence of competitive constraint upon a corporation are diverse. They are not confined to size or market share in relation to competitors, or to those matters combined with technical knowledge, raw materials or capital. Other matters such as easier access to supplies or government controls on the market are relevant if they bear upon the extent to which the corporation can act without being constrained by competition (at [45]).

81 In the Wholesale Market in the case before me, it is not in contention that the respondent has not only market power, but a substantial degree of market power. Both the applicant and the respondent, and their respective experts, are in agreement on this point. I accept that the respondent has a substantial degree of market power in this market. It is therefore appropriate to consider the claim of the applicant that the respondent has taken advantage of that power for a purpose proscribed by s 46 TPA.</text>

<text>95 So for example, in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177 Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power, because the nature of the purpose was such that, in the circumstances of that case, it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power ( Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 197-198, Melway 205 CLR at 17). The majority in Melway at 18 also noted comments of Scalia J in the Supreme Court of the United States when his Honour said:
 
 "Where a defendant maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws or that might even be viewed as procompetitive can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist."

4.

60 It follows that, in my view, the supply of data by the respondent in response to individual searches is not, as was the case in Paramedical Services [1999] FCA 548 or JS McMillan 77 FCR 337, an activity for reward which could be performed by any citizen or private trader, and thus potentially "carrying on a business" by the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/13.html</AustLII>
<text>77 The comments of his Honour were adopted by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 at 21 and 27, where their Honours said:
 
 "As Dawson J explained, in Queensland Wire , market power means capacity to behave in a certain way (which might include setting prices, granting or refusing supply, arranging systems of distribution), persistently, free from the constraints of competition..." (at 27)

94 The notion of "taking advantage of" in s 46(1) is closely related to the proscribed purpose in the section ( Melway 205 CLR at 16-17). As the majority observed in Melway ,
 
 (The TPA) requires, not merely the co-existence of market power, conduct and proscribed purpose, but a connection such that the firm whose conduct is in question can be said to be taking advantage of its power (at 21).

95 So for example, in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177 Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power, because the nature of the purpose was such that, in the circumstances of that case, it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power ( Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 197-198, Melway 205 CLR at 17). The majority in Melway at 18 also noted comments of Scalia J in the Supreme Court of the United States when his Honour said:
 
 "Where a defendant maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws or that might even be viewed as procompetitive can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist." ( Eastman Kodak Co v Image Technical Services Inc (1992) 504 US 451 at 488)

97 However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, and subsequently reiterated by the majority of the High Court in Melway 205 CLR at 17, "take advantage of" does not mean anything materially different from "use" and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy: per Mason CJ and Wilson J at 191, Deane J at 194, Dawson J at 198, Toohey J at 212-214 (cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 at [137] ). In terms of s 46 it does, however, entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment, and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s 46. So, as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd (1999) 166 ALR 410 (at 440), subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374 (at 434):
 
 "If the impugned conduct has a business rationale, that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power."

112 In this case it is clear that, in the Wholesale Market, the respondent is a monopoly supplier. Although there was some discussion throughout the hearing as to local government authorities in Queensland being a source of data, it is clear that they are not a source of Bulk Data. It is also not in contention that the reason for this monopoly is because of the statutory function of the respondent, which, as stated by Mr Rush in his affidavit, is the point of truth source for sales data. However as pointed out by the majority in Melway 205 CLR at 27:
 
 "Freedom from competitive constraint might make it possible, or easier, to refuse supply and, if it does, refusal to supply would constitute taking advantage of market power. But it does not follow that because a firm in fact enjoys freedom from competitive constraint, and in fact refuses to supply a particular person, there is a relevant connection between the freedom and the refusal. Presence of competitive constraint might be compatible with a similar refusal, especially if it is done to secure business advantages which would exist in a competitive environment."

117 Third, I am not persuaded by the submissions of the respondent, or the evidence of Mr Norling, that the removal of names and addresses from the Bulk Data would be conduct expected to occur within a (hypothetical) competitive wholesale market because suppliers other than the respondent in such a wholesale market would be subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). To paraphrase comments of the majority in Melway 205 CLR at 22 in a similar context, the evidentiary basis for that conclusion is not entirely clear, and not everyone would agree that, as a proposition of fact, it is self-evidently correct. Irrespective whether the information supplied by the respondent was as a matter of law a generally available publication and not subject to the Privacy Act as was submitted, in my view correctly, by the applicant:
 
&#8226; the assumption that the Privacy Act would compel suppliers in the hypothetical Wholesale Market from withholding the Excluded Data was not proven;
 
&#8226; there is no basis in fact or in law made out for assuming that the QVAS data and the supply thereof by a hypothetical competitor in the Wholesale Market is something that would be subject to the Privacy Act ; and
 
&#8226; depending on the identity of such hypothetical competitors they might or might not be organisations subject to the Privacy Act with the result that it was questionable whether the Privacy Act would have any application in any event.

118 Fourth, I do not accept as material the distinction drawn by the respondent between the facts of this case and other refusal to supply cases such as Melway [2001] HCA 13 ; 205 CLR 1 and Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, in that in those cases there was a refusal to supply one of several acquirers of goods and services. Whether or not all licensees were being treated equally in this case is not germane to the issue of whether the respondent, for reasons of its own, was taking advantage of its market power. (Whether it is relevant to purpose is a different question, which I shall consider shortly). In, for example, a hypothetical situation where a wholesale supplier formulated a strategy of itself entering the retail market and as part of that strategy informed its customers who were retailers in that retail market of its decision to henceforth refuse supply of its products, the fact that all retailers were equally disadvantaged does not mean that the wholesale supplier has not taken advantage of its market power.

121 Irrespective whether the respondent has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market, as a matter of law it will only be in breach of s 46 if it has done so for a purpose proscribed by s 46(1). That this is so is demonstrated by the unambiguous terms of s 46(1) , and decisions in Australia at the highest level confirming this principle (for example Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, Melway 205 CLR at 22).

158 Section 46(1)(c) must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA. As pointed out by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway 205 CLR at 13).
 
 "Section 46 aims to promote competition, not the private interests of particular persons or corporations."
 

(cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.</text>

<text>55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .

59 However, the position appears quite different with respect to the supply by the respondent - to end users - of data in response to individual over the counter searches. In particular, I note:
 
&#8226; There is a clear legislative delineation between the commercial contracts concerning bulk data sanctioned by s 77 , and the compulsory provision of information required s 76. 
 
&#8226; The supply by the respondent of s 76 data does not form any part of its business relationship with the licensees, who receive bulk data from the respondent.
 
&#8226; Obligations of the respondent in relation to valuation of land throughout Queensland, the collection of data, the maintenance of valuation records and the supply of the data are mandated by the VL Act . As Mr Hinson SC for the respondent submitted, the Department is required by s 76(1) VL Act to supply a certified copy of the particulars of a valuation entered on a valuation roll, to a person who pays the prescribed fee. I note the prescribed fee is found in the Valuation of Land Regulation 2003 (Qld). Indeed, I note that the long title of the VL Act is "An Act to make better provision for determining the valuation of land for rating and taxing purposes, and for matters incidental thereto or consequent thereon". I accept the evidence of Mr Rush that the QVAS data is the point of truth source for sales data, that is, how much a property was sold for at a particular date (Rush affidavit para 10). In my view, the supply of data by the respondent in respect of individual searches is an act of government and carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, similar to the provision of a certificate by the municipal council in Mid Density Development Pty Ltd 39 FCR 579.
 
&#8226; In light of the foregoing, the fact that the Department would undoubtedly enter into many transactions of this nature does not mean that the Department is "carrying on a business" of supplying data in response to individual searches.
 
&#8226; Although the respondent has submitted that local governments and the applicant can supply data in response to individual searches, in my view this does not derogate from the fact that the activities of the respondent in this regard constitute a function of government in the performance of its statutory duty rather than "carrying on a business". Indeed in this respect I note that:
 
 
 o the provision of valuation information by local government is required by s 995 Local Government Act 1993 (Qld) to be given to parties contemplated by that section, and is itself information which the chief executive is required to give local governments pursuant to s 73(1)(f) VL Act 
 o unlike the statutory obligation of the respondent, individual search data provided by the applicant is only to its customers, in a "commercially user friendly format" (Catelan affidavit para 3).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/48.html</AustLII>
<text>48 The extent to which the respondent is subject to s 46 TPA is a threshold issue in these proceedings. As was explained by McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority [2004] HCA 48 ; (2004) 219 CLR 90 at 116-117:
 
&#8226; while the conduct proscribed by the TPA, if it is to fall within s 2B, must be engaged in in the course of the entity carrying on a business, the conduct need not itself be the actual business engaged in
 
&#8226; had s 2B not been enacted, the impugned conduct would not be examinable in circumstances where the entity is the Crown in right of a State or Territory
 
&#8226; rather than examining specific conduct and then examining whether that contravention can be described as carrying on a business (as was unsuccessfully argued in NT Power [2004] HCA 48 ; 219 CLR 90), the correct approach is to first ascertain whether the entity "carries on a business". As the majority explained in NT Power [2004] HCA 48 ; 219 CLR 90, it is necessary to do this because:
 
 
 "this removes the governmental obstacle to curial examination of its conduct in order to see whether section 46 has been contravened." (at 117)

49 As was also observed by the majority in NT Power [2004] HCA 48 ; 219 CLR 90, it is also important not to substitute the question of defining markets for the question of whether a business is being carried on (at 117). Their Honours pointed out:
 
 "However, the words 'market' and 'business' have distinct meanings. Nothing in the Act limits the meaning of 'business' by reference to the criteria for market definition. Businesses often operate across the boundaries of separate markets... All these considerations militate against any approach to the question of 'carrying on a business' by reference to competition in a market... The only question is: what business was [the entity] carrying on? So far as it was carrying on a business, s 46 applied to it." (219 CLR at 118)

50 Prima facie , s 46 applies only to corporations, defined by s 4 TPA to mean bodies corporate that are:
 
(a) foreign corporations
 
(b) trading corporations formed within the limits of Australia or are financial corporations so formed
 
(c) incorporated in a Territory or
 
(d) are holding companies of bodies corporate of a kind referred to in paras (a), (b) or (c).

51 Clearly the respondent is not a corporation. However Pt 1 TPA makes provision for the extended application of certain parts of the Act. Of particular relevance in these proceedings is s 2B TPA. This section provides:
 
(1) The following provisions of this Act bind the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, so far as the Crown carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory:
 
 
 (a) Part IV
 (aa) Part VB
 (b) Part XIB 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the other provisions of this Act so far as they relate to the above provisions. 
 
 

(2) Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in right of a State or Territory liable to a pecuniary penalty or to be prosecuted for an offence.
 
(3) The protection in subsection (2) does not apply to an authority of a State or Territory.

52 Section 46 is found in Pt IV TPA. However the extended application only operates if the Crown in right of the relevant State or Territory is carrying on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State of Territory. As is clear from such cases as NT Power 219 CLR (particularly at 116) and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd (2007) 237 ALR 512 (particularly at 526-527), this condition is strictly applied.

55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .

120 The role of the port authority in Stirling Harbour [2007] FCA 1381and the Federal Airports Corporation in Plume [1997] 1019 FCA can be contrasted with the role of the respondent in its supply of Collected Data to the applicant and the other licensees, namely that of a wholesaler of information on commercial terms dictated by the respondent, in an environment where the respondent was also a supplier of data in the Retail Market. While the regulatory power of the respondent to collect data and enter licence agreements clearly assisted its commercial position in entering such agreements (cf comments of the majority in NT Power 219 CLR at 142) the conduct of the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data but continuing to supply other data on commercial terms was a market, rather than a regulatory, issue.

133 Section 46(1)(a) contemplates circumstances where an entity, through its substantial degree of market power in a market, takes advantage of that power for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging another entity which is its competitor in another market. This is plain from the terms of the section itself, and follows, for example, from observations of McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power at 219 CLR at 114-115, 145. Accordingly, the respondent would have acted in breach of s 46(1)(a) TPA if it took advantage of its power in the Wholesale Market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging the applicant in the Retail Market, if the applicant was a competitor of the respondent in that Retail Market.

134 The applicant conceded that there was no direct evidence that the respondent's purpose was to substantially damage the applicant in the Retail Market. The applicant invited the court to draw the inference that this was the purpose of the respondent, and referred in particular to the change in the products to be offered by removal of the Excluded Data, and the simultaneous change in pricing under the proposed fees structure. In summary, the applicant contended:
 
&#8226; The applicant has substantial market share in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; The respondent is a competitor of the applicant in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; The removal of the Excluded Data will make the applicant's products less attractive to its existing customers in comparison to the existing offerings of the applicant.
 
&#8226; The result of a proposed licence fee incorporating a royalty would result in a licence fee payable by the applicant to the respondent in excess of $1 million in contrast with the current flat fee, which proposal has not been adequately explained. The respondent did not produce one document evidencing the way in which the pricing for either the access fee or the royalty fee was worked up for these particular products.
 
&#8226; The removal of the Excluded Data was allegedly precipitated by complaints concerning direct marketing activities by real estate agents, but this does not explain the basis of the particular pricing provisions.
 
&#8226; In any event, the respondent's witnesses exaggerated the number and account of complaints concerning direct marketing activities by real estate agents, and in fact the number of complaints received was minor (a total of 139 written complaints discovered between 1997 and 2006), which would not justify substantial overhaul to contractual arrangements in place since 1992.

135 In summary the respondent submitted:
 
&#8226; The evidence is overwhelming that the only purpose of the respondent in implementing its proposals concerning the Excluded Data and the pricing structure was to prevent the misuse of the Excluded Data for direct marketing.
 
&#8226; There is no evidence that the respondent had the purpose of substantially damaging the applicant in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; For s 46(1)(a) TPA to apply the applicant and the respondent must be competitors in a market, and the only market in which the applicant alleges it competes with the respondent is the Retail Market: para 6 of the amended statement of claim.
 
&#8226; The applicant and the respondent are not competitors in the Retail Market. There are substantial differences between the data offerings to end users made by the applicant and the respondent, namely:
 
 
 o the respondent offers three products to end users based on the Collected Data: Fry affidavit para 4(a) and annexure WBF-1
 o the applicant offers a much greater range of products: Matthews affidavit, RP Data's Information Memorandum pp 23-32, and Williams expert report at paras 83, 85 and Figure 1
 o the applicant does not see the respondent as a competitor: RP Data's Information Memorandum pp 14, 15 and 17, and comments of Mr Catelan (TS p 57 ll 40)
 o evidence of Mr Rush indicates that the respondent has no plans to offer integrated data services of the kind offered by the applicant (TS pp 304-305, p 306 ll 12-2-, p 310 ll 25-35 and 40 and p 312 ll 15-20). 
 

&#8226; There is no evidence that the proposal is part of some grand conspiracy by the respondent to "get back" at the applicant.
 
&#8226; In 1997 the respondent was encouraging more licensees to come into the Retail Market and reduced its fees to allow that to occur. The unchallenged evidence is that all licensees were treated equally.
 
&#8226; Mr Fry deposed that he had told the applicant that if it did not agree to the new licence conditions and refused to enter into a licence agreement, it would not be able to receive licensed data after 30 June 2005, and deposed further that this would also apply to the other seven licensees.
 Was the respondent a "competitor" of the applicant in the Retail Market?</text>

Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .

60 It follows that, in my view, the supply of data by the respondent in response to individual searches is not, as was the case in Paramedical Services [1999] FCA 548 or JS McMillan 77 FCR 337, an activity for reward which could be performed by any citizen or private trader, and thus potentially "carrying on a business" by the respondent.</text>

<text>119 Finally, in my view the power used by the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data from supply was not regulatory power, but market power. I have already found that, although the collection of data by the respondent was pursuant to statutory obligations, the supply of Collected Data by the respondent to the applicant and the other licensees was in the course of carrying on a business by the respondent. In my view this case is distinguishable from Stirling Harbour [2000] FCA 1381 and Plume v Federal Airports Corporation [1997] 1019 FCA where the Court found that relevant entity was exercising regulatory authority rather than market power:
 
&#8226; In Stirling Harbour [2007] FCA 1381 , the function of the port authority under the relevant statute was to arrange for port services to be provided, including towage, and did so by tender. The Full Court in that case was satisfied that the port authority had assumed the role of a market regulator.
 
&#8226; Similarly in Plume [1997] 1019 FCA, the court was satisfied that the conduct of the Federal Airports Corporation was properly characterised as use of a regulatory power designed for the benefit of the members of the public who had occasion to use the facilities of the airport at Alice Springs.

120 The role of the port authority in Stirling Harbour [2007] FCA 1381and the Federal Airports Corporation in Plume [1997] 1019 FCA can be contrasted with the role of the respondent in its supply of Collected Data to the applicant and the other licensees, namely that of a wholesaler of information on commercial terms dictated by the respondent, in an environment where the respondent was also a supplier of data in the Retail Market. While the regulatory power of the respondent to collect data and enter licence agreements clearly assisted its commercial position in entering such agreements (cf comments of the majority in NT Power 219 CLR at 142) the conduct of the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data but continuing to supply other data on commercial terms was a market, rather than a regulatory, issue.</text>

(cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.</text>

<text>65 The necessity for competition to exist before a "market" is constituted was emphasised in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374. As Gleeson CJ and Callinan J observed:
 
 "A market is an area of close competition; a field of rivalry. As the passage from Re Queensland Co-Operative Milling Association Ltd quoted above indicates, and as s 46(3) recognises, both the supply side and the demand side are relevant to an assessment of the market. It does not solve, but merely re-states, the problem to speak of sub-markets. There may be a wider, and a narrower, area of rivalry; but, if the narrowest area itself constitutes a market, then it is power and conduct in that area that must be examined." (at 422-423) (cf Deane J in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 195)

75 The notion of "market power" in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration. The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177. Usefully, Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109 at 138 summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 188-190 the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power:
 
 "(a) "the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time, supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product";
 (b) "the extent to which the conduct of [any of the respondents] in that market is constrained by the conduct of...competitors or potential competitors..." (s 46(3));
 (c) market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as "the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed" (Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co (1948) 334 US 495 at 528);
 (d) the presence of vertical integration is another factor, but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists; and
 (e) to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market? That is to say, what are the barriers to entry? It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power. See also the judgment of the Full Court of this court in Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission at FCR 336 9."

76 Further in Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 200, Dawson J observed:
 
 "The term 'market power' is ordinarily taken to be a reference to the power to raise price by restricting output in a sustainable manner... But market power has aspects other than influence upon the market price. It may be manifested by practices directed at excluding competition such as exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, predatory pricing or refusal to deal... The ability to engage persistently in these practices may be as indicative of market power as the ability to influence prices. Thus Kaysen and Turner define market power as follows: 
 
 
 'A firm possesses market power when it can behave persistently in a manner different from the behaviour that a competitive market would enforce on a firm facing otherwise similar cost and demand conditions.' (Kaysen and Turner, Antitrust Policy (1959) p 75) 
 
 
 ... Market power is thus the advantage which flows from monopoly or near monopoly..."

77 The comments of his Honour were adopted by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 at 21 and 27, where their Honours said:
 
 "As Dawson J explained, in Queensland Wire , market power means capacity to behave in a certain way (which might include setting prices, granting or refusing supply, arranging systems of distribution), persistently, free from the constraints of competition..." (at 27)

88 However, with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. In particular, I note the following:
 
&#8226; In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement, the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that, because of the respondent's substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market, "it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market". The respondent points out however, that the experts do not say that the respondent has a "substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market. This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent's substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market. Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market (TS p 88 ll 40-42) and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (TS p 78 ll 3-4).
 
&#8226; Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a "downstream" retail market is a relatively common phenomenon, and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court, for example, in the context of claims of alleged anti-competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493) , in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA ( Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146) , and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( Australian Gas Light Company (ACN 052 167 405) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (No 3) [2003] FCA 1525). However, the ability of an entity to "substantially influence patterns of competition" in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market, as agreed by the experts, is not, in my view, necessarily tantamount to "a substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market or even, as submitted by the respondent, "market power" within the meaning of the s 46 TPA.
 
&#8226; As I have already noted, the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different, supplying different services to different customers. It is not in contention before me that there is "a" Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information. However, whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product, it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base, namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant's services, as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter. It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market (RP Data Information Memorandum Document 1 pp 14, 15; evidence of Mr Catelan TS p 57 ll 37-42). In this respect, the "market power" of the respondent in the Retail Market, viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market, is not obvious. Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end-users, it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 158.
 
&#8226; I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 
&#8226; I also note that:
 
 
 o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement (TS p 2 ll 1-14, p 7 ll 19-23), Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market
 o Mr Jackson QC, in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market, confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts, and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market. 
 

&#8226; I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement, I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; As pointed out in Queensland Wire , the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing, barriers to entry, market share. However in this case I note, for example, that:
 
 
 a. no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent
 b. although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent, there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers
 c. no evidence is lead as to market share (if any) in the Retail Market held by the respondent.

95 So for example, in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177 Deane J held that the identification of the proscribed purpose in that case led directly to the conclusion that BHP was taking advantage of its market power, because the nature of the purpose was such that, in the circumstances of that case, it could not have been achieved by the conduct impugned had it not been for the existence of the market power ( Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 197-198, Melway 205 CLR at 17). The majority in Melway at 18 also noted comments of Scalia J in the Supreme Court of the United States when his Honour said:
 
 "Where a defendant maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws or that might even be viewed as procompetitive can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist." ( Eastman Kodak Co v Image Technical Services Inc (1992) 504 US 451 at 488)

97 However as was pointed by the High Court in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, and subsequently reiterated by the majority of the High Court in Melway 205 CLR at 17, "take advantage of" does not mean anything materially different from "use" and does not require conduct which is predatory or morally blameworthy: per Mason CJ and Wilson J at 191, Deane J at 194, Dawson J at 198, Toohey J at 212-214 (cf also the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 at [137] ). In terms of s 46 it does, however, entail an analysis of actions in the context of a competitive environment, and identification of a determinative approach in the entity with the substantial market power to achieve an outcome proscribed by s 46. So, as Heerey J said in ACCC v Boral Ltd (1999) 166 ALR 410 (at 440), subsequently approved by the majority of the High Court in Boral Besser [2003] HCA 5 ; 215 CLR 374 (at 434):
 
 "If the impugned conduct has a business rationale, that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power."

118 Fourth, I do not accept as material the distinction drawn by the respondent between the facts of this case and other refusal to supply cases such as Melway [2001] HCA 13 ; 205 CLR 1 and Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, in that in those cases there was a refusal to supply one of several acquirers of goods and services. Whether or not all licensees were being treated equally in this case is not germane to the issue of whether the respondent, for reasons of its own, was taking advantage of its market power. (Whether it is relevant to purpose is a different question, which I shall consider shortly). In, for example, a hypothetical situation where a wholesale supplier formulated a strategy of itself entering the retail market and as part of that strategy informed its customers who were retailers in that retail market of its decision to henceforth refuse supply of its products, the fact that all retailers were equally disadvantaged does not mean that the wholesale supplier has not taken advantage of its market power.

121 Irrespective whether the respondent has taken advantage of its substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market, as a matter of law it will only be in breach of s 46 if it has done so for a purpose proscribed by s 46(1). That this is so is demonstrated by the unambiguous terms of s 46(1) , and decisions in Australia at the highest level confirming this principle (for example Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177, Melway 205 CLR at 22).

123 In relation to identifying the "purpose" of the respondent, as illustrated by the cases listed in Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act 28th edition para 1.46.65, the weight of authority indicates that the relevant purpose is to be identified on the basis of a subjective test rather than objectively, although purpose may be established by inference from the conduct of the respondent (s 46(7)). As Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire 167 CLR, the reference to "for the purpose of" carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve the result spoken of in each of the paragraphs in s 46(1) (at CLR 214). I note that the subjective nature of the relevant intent was also endorsed by the High Court in Boral Besser 215 CLR at 484.

161 Second, in my view the "purpose" of the respondent, which as Toohey J observed in Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177 carries with it the notion of an intent to achieve a certain result, was to prevent the Excluded Data being used for direct marketing. The clear inference which can be drawn from the conduct of the respondent is that, despite publicly expressed concerns of the respondent concerning usage of its data for direct marketing, and although the licensees were required by the licence agreement between themselves and the respondent to ensure that end users had agreed not to use the data or data products supplied by the licensees for direct marketing, nonetheless end users (primarily some real estate agents) were engaging in direct marketing using data sourced originally from the respondent. I note that the possibility of the Excluded Data being withdrawn because of inappropriate use by end users had been anticipated by cl 9.11 of the 2003 licence agreement which provided:
 
 "The Licensor reserves the right to exclude future supply of certain particulars forming part of the Licensed Data if the Chief Executive of the Licensor is satisfied on reasonable grounds, that inclusion of the data may result in inappropriate use or disclosure. Furthermore the Licensor may prohibit or limit distribution of certain particulars forming part of the Licensed Data."

162 It is because of the respondent's view that Excluded Data was being misused for direct marketing that the respondent formulated its proposal to exclude the Excluded Data from the Collected Data it supplied the applicant and the other licensees. Excluded Data could still be obtained from the respondent, because the respondent was statutorily obliged to supply it. One obvious result of end users obtaining Excluded Data on the basis of individual searches is that the cost and process of so obtaining that information is a clear disincentive to direct marketing activities, which is compatible with the stated purpose of the respondent.

163 Third, the applicant made a number of claims in the amended statement of claim concerning the alleged intention of the respondent to harm the applicant. I make the following observations:
 
&#8226; In relation to the claim of the applicant that the respondent had an intention to harm and prevent the applicant competing in the market place by offering another party, Infopac, favourable terms in order to compete with the applicant (amended statement of claim para 10(b)(i)(B)(I)), no evidence is produced other than that of Mr Catelan in his affidavit, referring to alleged statements of Mr Witt in 1998. I note that these statements were allegedly made almost 10 years ago, and appear to bear little relationship to the complaint before me. Further, I note that Mr Witt was not cross-examined in relation to these statements, nor did any other person who could give direct evidence as to such an offer give evidence. I also note Mr Oakley was cross-examined in relation to a letter from Infopac received by him in 1998 (pp 278-279) however there was no substantiation that the respondent had sought to cause harm to the applicant in connection with an contractual relationship between the respondent and Infopac. I therefore give no weight to this aspect of the claim.
 
&#8226; Similarly Mr Witt was not cross-examined concerning the allegations of the applicant with respect to Mr Edwards and Residex (amended statement of claim para 10(b)(i)(B)(II)). No evidence was given by Mr Edwards, and Mr Edwards did not appear as a witness in these proceedings. I also give no weight to this aspect of the claim.
 
&#8226; In relation to the claim of the applicant that on 4 February 2005 Mr Fry and Mr Oakley said to Ms Jane Woodward of the applicant that if the applicant did not agree to the new licence conditions the applicant would not receive any Collected Data in the future, I note that:
 
 
 o Mr Fry stated in para 28 of his affidavit that what occurred was that "I said that if RP Data did not agree to the new licence conditions and refused to enter into a licence agreement then RP Data would not be able to receive licensed data after 30 June 2005. This would apply to the other seven licensees." Mr Fry was not cross-examined with respect to this statement.
 o Ms Woodward gave no evidence in these proceedings.
 o It is clear from the evidence of Mr Fry that all licensees were being treated in the same way, and this evidence does not establish a breach of s 46 as alleged.</text>

If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of its power."

158 Section 46(1)(c) must be read in the context of the policy objective sought to be achieved by the TPA. As pointed out by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Melway 205 CLR at 13).
 
 "Section 46 aims to promote competition, not the private interests of particular persons or corporations."
 

(cf Boral 215 CLR 373 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at 411, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 429, McHugh J at 458-459; Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Baxter Healthcare 237 ALR at 535, Rural Press [2002] FCAFC 213 at [139] , Universal Music 131 FCR at 585, and the discussion of Professor Corones at pp 34-37). It follows that the conduct of a person which the corporation or other entity with the substantial degree of market power seeks to affect must be conduct in the nature of competition in a market. Like s 46(1)(a), the breadth of application of s 46(1)(c) is such that it does not need to be the market in which the respondent is a participant (cf Merkel J in Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (t/as Auto Fashions Australia) v Melway Publishing Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 627 at 643, Toohey J in Ross Payne &amp; Co v Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 3 August 1983, Wilcox J in Pont Data Australia Pty Ltd v ASX Operations Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 523 at 555). Accordingly, it is within the scope of s 46(1)(c) that a corporation or entity with a substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market could breach s 46(1)(c) because, inter alia , its purpose was to deter or prevent the a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.</text>

<text>88 However, with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. In particular, I note the following:
 
&#8226; In the Joint Expert Statement of Areas of Agreement and Disagreement, the expert witnesses for both parties agreed that, because of the respondent's substantial degree of market power in the Wholesale Market, "it is able to substantially influence patterns of competition in the Retail Market". The respondent points out however, that the experts do not say that the respondent has a "substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market. This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent's substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market. Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market (TS p 88 ll 40-42) and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (TS p 78 ll 3-4).
 
&#8226; Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a "downstream" retail market is a relatively common phenomenon, and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court, for example, in the context of claims of alleged anti-competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493) , in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA ( Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146) , and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( Australian Gas Light Company (ACN 052 167 405) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (No 3) [2003] FCA 1525). However, the ability of an entity to "substantially influence patterns of competition" in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market, as agreed by the experts, is not, in my view, necessarily tantamount to "a substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market or even, as submitted by the respondent, "market power" within the meaning of the s 46 TPA.
 
&#8226; As I have already noted, the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different, supplying different services to different customers. It is not in contention before me that there is "a" Retail Market in which both the applicant and the respondent are supplying information. However, whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product, it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base, namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant's services, as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter. It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market (RP Data Information Memorandum Document 1 pp 14, 15; evidence of Mr Catelan TS p 57 ll 37-42). In this respect, the "market power" of the respondent in the Retail Market, viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market, is not obvious. Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end-users, it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 158.
 
&#8226; I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 
&#8226; I also note that:
 
 
 o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement (TS p 2 ll 1-14, p 7 ll 19-23), Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market
 o Mr Jackson QC, in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market, confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts, and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market. 
 

&#8226; I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement, I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; As pointed out in Queensland Wire , the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing, barriers to entry, market share. However in this case I note, for example, that:
 
 
 a. no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent
 b. although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent, there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers
 c. no evidence is lead as to market share (if any) in the Retail Market held by the respondent.</text>

<text>55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .</text>

90 I make this point particularly in light of the onus of proof which rests on the applicant to demonstrate that the impugned conduct breaches s 46 ( Sodastream Limited v Electronics (Broken Hill) Pty Limited (1985) 60 ALR 427 at 430; John S Hayes and Associates Pty Limited v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited (1994) ATPR |P41-318 at 42,237, Stirling Harbour [2000] FCA 1381 at [13] .)

119 Finally, in my view the power used by the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data from supply was not regulatory power, but market power. I have already found that, although the collection of data by the respondent was pursuant to statutory obligations, the supply of Collected Data by the respondent to the applicant and the other licensees was in the course of carrying on a business by the respondent. In my view this case is distinguishable from Stirling Harbour [2000] FCA 1381 and Plume v Federal Airports Corporation [1997] 1019 FCA where the Court found that relevant entity was exercising regulatory authority rather than market power:
 
&#8226; In Stirling Harbour [2007] FCA 1381 , the function of the port authority under the relevant statute was to arrange for port services to be provided, including towage, and did so by tender. The Full Court in that case was satisfied that the port authority had assumed the role of a market regulator.
 
&#8226; Similarly in Plume [1997] 1019 FCA, the court was satisfied that the conduct of the Federal Airports Corporation was properly characterised as use of a regulatory power designed for the benefit of the members of the public who had occasion to use the facilities of the airport at Alice Springs.

120 The role of the port authority in Stirling Harbour [2007] FCA 1381and the Federal Airports Corporation in Plume [1997] 1019 FCA can be contrasted with the role of the respondent in its supply of Collected Data to the applicant and the other licensees, namely that of a wholesaler of information on commercial terms dictated by the respondent, in an environment where the respondent was also a supplier of data in the Retail Market. While the regulatory power of the respondent to collect data and enter licence agreements clearly assisted its commercial position in entering such agreements (cf comments of the majority in NT Power 219 CLR at 142) the conduct of the respondent in withdrawing the Excluded Data but continuing to supply other data on commercial terms was a market, rather than a regulatory, issue.</text>

<text>88 However, with respect there is little material presented before me upon which I can find that the respondent does have a substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. In particular, I note the following:

<text>96 Similarly, the Privy Council in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd v Clear Communications Ltd (1995) 1 NZLR 385 at 402 observed that use and purpose, though separate requirements, will not be easily separated.

147 While in some cases where an entity has used its dominant position it may, as the Privy Council said in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 NZLR at 402 be hard to imagine a case in which it would have done so otherwise than for the purpose of producing an anti-competitive effect, and it will legitimate for a court to infer from the respondent's use of its dominant position that its purpose was to produce the effect in fact produced, the respondent in this case is a government department under the direction of a State government Minister which, while engaged in supply of data for revenue, is also required to take into account broader community interests. In my view it is not difficult to accept that the public interest to ensure that its data base is not misused for direct marketing purposes is what has motivated the respondent to act in this case.

148 Third, from the consistent evidence of the respondent's witnesses it could not be inferred that changes to the respondent's pricing structure were implemented for the purpose of eliminating or damaging the applicant as a competitor. The respondent's proposal was implemented in relation to all licensees, not only the applicant and in accordance with a Department wide approach. One possible explanation for this development is that the respondent was seeking to eliminate all possible competition in the Retail Market, including that posed by the applicant. However it is inconsistent with a deliberate attack on the applicant specifically as a competitor.

149 Fourth, according to evidence of Mr Witt, the current licence fees are considerably lower than they were in the late 1990s when the applicant paid $600,000 upfront plus $50,000 per month for five years for its licence (affidavit of Mr Witt para 13). The applicant currently pays $158,749 per annum in licence fees, and under the proposed new licence the applicant would pay a maximum of $158,749 comprising licence fees and a capped royalty fee (Witt affidavit para 13, Oakley affidavit para 27). The proposal of the respondent meant, at least in the foreseeable future, that the licensees would not pay more under the proposed licence than they were paying under the current arrangement (oral evidence of Mr Oakley TS p 279 ll 34-45), although clearly without receiving the Excluded Data, which is a key aspect of the applicant's complaint.</text>

However, whereas it is clear that the respondent supplies base data to members of the general public who pay the prescribed statutory fee and makes available its SmartMap product, it is also clear that the applicant offers a much greater range of sophisticated products to a different customer base, namely parties who are prepared to subscribe to the applicant's services, as distinct from any members of the public who seek information over the counter. It is also apparent from the evidence before me that the applicant does not view the respondent as a significant competitor in its area of the Retail Market (RP Data Information Memorandum Document 1 pp 14, 15; evidence of Mr Catelan TS p 57 ll 37-42). In this respect, the "market power" of the respondent in the Retail Market, viewed in light of its activities in this broad Retail Market, is not obvious. Even if the respondent had market power in its area of the Retail Market in respect of its supply of raw data to end-users, it has not been demonstrated that such market power extends throughout the entire Retail Market as was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in Singapore Airlines Limited v Tabropane Tours WA Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 158.
 
&#8226; I note the submission of Mr Hinson SC for the respondent that the evidence fell short of establishing that the respondent had any market power let along any substantial degree of market power in the Retail Market. Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 
&#8226; I also note that:
 
 
 o despite a number of oral submissions in his opening statement (TS p 2 ll 1-14, p 7 ll 19-23), Mr Jackson QC for the applicant did not subsequently press the claim that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market
 o Mr Jackson QC, in his written submissions concerning the issue of power in the Retail Market, confines the position of the applicant to the agreed position of the experts, and does not specifically submit that the respondent has a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market. 
 

&#8226; I have carefully reviewed the transcript and after submissions in the opening statement, I can identify no subsequent submissions made on behalf of the applicant that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market.
 
&#8226; As pointed out in Queensland Wire , the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing, barriers to entry, market share. However in this case I note, for example, that:
 
 
 a. no evidence is lead as to the impact on prices in the Retail Market of conduct of the respondent
 b. although the entry of retailers into the market appears dependent upon their ability to obtain a licence from the respondent, there is no evidence before me as the extent to which this is a barrier to market entry by retailers
 c. no evidence is lead as to market share (if any) in the Retail Market held by the respondent.</text>

<text>75 The notion of "market power" in the sense of capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors has been the subject of frequent judicial consideration. The leading case in this context is Queensland Wire [1989] HCA 6 ; 167 CLR 177. Usefully, Lockhart J in Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 109 at 138 summarised from the judgment of Mason CJ and Wilson J in Queensland Wire 167 CLR at 188-190 the following factors as relevant in defining and identifying market power:
 
 "(a) "the ability of a firm to raise prices above the supply cost without rivals taking away customers in due time, supply cost being the minimum cost an efficient firm would incur in producing the product";
 (b) "the extent to which the conduct of [any of the respondents] in that market is constrained by the conduct of...competitors or potential competitors..." (s 46(3));
 (c) market share of each respondent must be examined but this alone is generally not determinative of market power as "the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is placed" (Mason CJ and Wilson J adopted the language of Reed J in United States v Columbia Steel Co (1948) 334 US 495 at 528);
 (d) the presence of vertical integration is another factor, but its presence does not necessarily mean that a substantial degree of power exists; and
 (e) to what extent is it rational or possible for new entrants to enter the relevant market? That is to say, what are the barriers to entry? It is this factor which must be taken as the primary consideration in determining market power.

<text>55 Although the phrase "carries on a business" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows:
 
1. "Business" in the context of s 2B is normally a "wide and general" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since "business" includes "a business not carried on for profit": NT Power 219 CLR at 116.
 
2. The phrase "carries on a business" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that "with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia." (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794).
 
3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, "carrying on a business" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451.
 
4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as "carrying on a business": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not "carrying on a business" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes "carrying on a business". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services.
 
5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] .</text>
