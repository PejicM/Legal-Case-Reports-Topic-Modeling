<text>In some respects, the availability of review under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act is wider, and in some respects narrower, than that available under the AD(JR) Act. What is important for present purposes is that the notion of a "matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament" in s 39B(1)(c) of the Judiciary Act is wider than that of a "decision ... made under an enactment" of s 5 of the AD(JR) Act. Reference may be made to such cases as LNC Industries Ltd v BMW (Aust) Ltd [1983] HCA 31 ; (1983) 151 CLR 575 , Australian Solar Mesh Sales Pty Ltd v Anderson [2000] FCA 864 ; (2000) 101 FCR 1 , and ACTEW Corporation Ltd v Pangallo [2002] FCAFC 325 ; (2002) 127 FCR 1 , for an indication of the breadth of the concept of a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</text>

<text>Third, while s 31A of the FCA Act (mutatis mutandis, s 17A of the FM Act) achieves nothing of significance in relation to migration cases, it is of general application and therefore affects all proceedings brought in the Court. The question of the precise meaning of s 31A of the FCA Act and s 17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.

<text>Furthermore, Mr O'Neill's decision was not within the expression "decision to which this Act applies" in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act because it was not "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment ..." because: it was not a final, ultimate or operative determination, and was therefore not a "decision" for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (" ABT v Bond ") at 338); and it was not required or authorised by any enactment, and legal rights or duties do not owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement ( Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 (" Tang ") at [78] [80]). 
The Guidelines are not "an enactment" as defined in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act, because they are not an instrument made under an Act: the most that can be said is that they were issued by the Commissioner to ATO officers as part of his general administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("the ITAA"), s 8 of which provides: "The Commissioner shall have the general administration of this Act".</text>

<tocase>Australian National University v Burns [1982] FCA 191 ; (1982) 43 ALR 25</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1982/191.html</AustLII>
<text>Gleeson CJ referred (at [10]) to the University's reliance on judgments in Australian National University v Burns [1982] FCA 191 ; (1982) 43 ALR 25 and ANU v Lewins in this Court to the effect that in order to satisfy the description of a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment, a decision must be authorised or required by a statute and must be given legal force or effect by the statute. The Chief Justice observed that it is not enough that the decision be within power, and that the AD(JR) Act does not provide for review of all decisions of an administrative character made in pursuance of any power or authority that has its foundation in a statute. Gleeson CJ approved of a statement by Lehane J in ANU v Lewins (at 101) that a decision meets the test "only if it is one for the making of which the relevant statute either expressly or impliedly provides and one to which the statute gives legal force or effect".

The ITAA does not expressly or impliedly provide for the making of guidelines or the making of a decision excluding particular documents from their scope. Moreover, the ITAA does not give legal force or effect to the Guidelines or to Mr O'Neill's decision.

The proper analysis is that the Guidelines have been made by the Commissioner pursuant to his general power of administration under s 8 of the ITAA; the granting of the concession and the discretion to exclude particular documents from it are attributable only to that general power of administration; and it is O 33 r 12 of the FCRs that imposes a procedural obligation on the applicants as an adjunct to the appeal proceedings.</text>

<text>With respect to whether the decision was made under an "instrument", the applicants submit that Tang establishes that the Guidelines are an instrument for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act. The High Court's decision in that case departed from previous authority to the effect that documents issued under a general power of administration could not constitute an instrument under the AD(JR) Act (as an illustration of that previous course of authority they refer to Australian National University v Lewins (1996) 68 FCR 87 (" ANU v Lewins") ).</text>

<tocase>Bellinz v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 84 FCR 154</tocase>
<text>Bellinz v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 84 FCR 154 is also distinguishable. A Full Court of this Court held that where the question was one as to the inclusion of an amount as assessable income, or the allowance of an amount as a deduction, and no question of discretion or of administrative procedure arose, the Commissioner cannot be said to have acted unfairly where he has acted in accordance with the law. This is true even if there is an element of discrimination as between his decision in the case at hand and his decision in other cases. Such a holding, therefore, does not cover the present case because the Guidelines lay down administrative procedures and provide for a discretionary decision to exempt certain documents from the concession granted in them.</text>

<tocase>Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239</tocase>
<text>I need not recount in further detail the claims of estoppel, unfairness and waiver. In relation to "substantive unfairness", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (" Daihatsu ") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman. REASONING 
 Order 20 of the FCRs and s 31A of the FCA Act

Deloitte and Daihatsu concerned notices issued by the Commissioner under s 264 of the ITAA. In Deloitte , Goldberg J (at 451) expressed the opinion, and the Commissioner did not dispute, that the Commissioner's delegate was bound to have regard to the Guidelines when deciding to issue a notice under s 264. His Honour said that for this reason it was not necessary for him to deal with the Commissioner's submission that the Guidelines were not a source of rights. In Daihatsu , the taxpayer sought relief under s 16 of the AD(JR) Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of notices issued under s 264 of the ITAA. Lehane J (at [68]) refused relief on the merits.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QCA/2005/227.html</AustLII>
<text>I do not propose to add greatly to the discussion of the meaning and effect of s 31A. In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of the similar rule 24.2 of the CPRs noted at [53] above, that the expressions "no real prospect of succeeding" and "no real prospect of successfully defending" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects: Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 at 92; Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 at [90], [95], [133] [134], [158] [162]; ED &amp; F Man Products Ltd v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8] . The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held, following Swain v Hillman and Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England , that the "no reasonable prospects of success" test requires the court to determine whether there are "real" as opposed to "fanciful" prospects of success: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] QCA 227 ; [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235. The New South Wales Court of Appeal had to consider the expression "reasonable prospects of success" as it occurred in s 198J of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) in Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 153 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 300. That section prohibited a solicitor or barrister from providing legal services on a claim or defence of a claim for damages unless the solicitor or barrister reasonably believed on the basis of provable facts and a reasonably arguable view of the law that the claim or the defence had reasonable prospects of success. Later subsections elaborated on the meaning of the prohibition. This fact, coupled with the fact that the prohibition was directed to the reasonable belief of the solicitor or barrister, renders the discussion not directly relevant to the summary dismissal context in which the court is required to determine if there are reasonable prospects of success following an inter partes hearing.</text>

<text>Under s 31A I must be satisfied that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of success, but as s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail. I suggest that the legislature's intention in enacting s 31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92, and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130: see Lawrenson Light Metal Die Casting Pty Ltd (in liq) v Cosmick Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 753 at [15].</text>

<tocase>Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 123 FCR 499</tocase>
<text>For the proposition that the Commissioner is entitled to adopt a policy consistent with the statute to provide guidance as to the exercise of a statutory discretionary power, the applicants cite Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 123 FCR 499 at [34]. Hely J there held that while there must not be an inflexible policy that limits a statutory discretion, a policy as to how the discretion will "normally" be exercised can be adopted. The case concerned the power given to the Commissioner by s 255- 10 (1) of Sch 1 of the TAA to defer the time at which the amount of a tax-related liability was, or was to become, due and payable.

With respect to the competency of the AD(JR) application, the applicants submit that:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/473.html</AustLII>
<text>Their Honours noted (at [78]) that while a decision, in order to be susceptible to review under the AD(JR) Act must be either expressly or by implication authorised or required by an enactment, requirement or authority is not alone sufficient. The further stipulation that the decision must be "of an administrative character" meant that there must be an affecting of legal rights and obligations. Their Honours said (at [80]): 
 
 Do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement [cf R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett at 154] ? To adapt what was said by Lehane J in Lewins [ ANU v Lewins at 103], does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations? Are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general law but by virtue of the statute? [ General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 169]. 
 

 
Mr O'Neill's decision does not derive from the ITAA a capacity to affect legal rights and obligations. Nor do legal rights (of the Commissioner) or duties (of the applicants) in relation to the production of Documents 226 to 238 "owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement": Tang at [80]. It is O 33 r 12 and the general law that give the Commissioner procedural rights and impose on the applicants procedural obligations.

Black CJ said (at 273) that where the sole source of authority for a decision is a general power of administration conferred by an enactment, the decision will be "unlikely to be one that is given force or effect by an enactment or by a principle of law applicable to the enactment". In saying this, the Chief Justice quoted (at 272) the following passage from the judgment of Davies and Einfeld JJ, with which Gummow J agreed, in General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation at 172: 
 
 The ADJR Act is thus concerned with decisions which, being authorised or required by an enactment, are given force or effect by the enactment or by a principle of law applicable to the enactment.

On a broad view, the Commissioner is exercising public power in relation to the assessment and recovery of tax, although the right to issue a notice to produce under the FCRs is not itself such a power. The assessment and recovery of tax is radically different from, for example, conduct leading to the making of contracts and the making of them: see General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation . I am not satisfied that the broad view referred to has no reasonable prospects of prevailing.

There should be a final hearing, as soon as practicable, of the claim under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act .

Unlike the debate relating to s 39B(1) , that relating to s 39B(1A)(c) was confined to the question of jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/7.html</AustLII>
<text>Furthermore, Mr O'Neill's decision was not within the expression "decision to which this Act applies" in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act because it was not "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment ..." because: it was not a final, ultimate or operative determination, and was therefore not a "decision" for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (" ABT v Bond ") at 338); and it was not required or authorised by any enactment, and legal rights or duties do not owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement ( Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 (" Tang ") at [78] [80]). 
The Guidelines are not "an enactment" as defined in s 3(1) of the AD(JR) Act, because they are not an instrument made under an Act: the most that can be said is that they were issued by the Commissioner to ATO officers as part of his general administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("the ITAA"), s 8 of which provides: "The Commissioner shall have the general administration of this Act".

With respect to whether the decision was made under an "instrument", the applicants submit that Tang establishes that the Guidelines are an instrument for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act. The High Court's decision in that case departed from previous authority to the effect that documents issued under a general power of administration could not constitute an instrument under the AD(JR) Act (as an illustration of that previous course of authority they refer to Australian National University v Lewins (1996) 68 FCR 87 (" ANU v Lewins") ).

All earlier decisions on the matter must now be understood in light of the High Court's consideration in Tang of the expression "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment". That case concerned a decision of Griffith University, through its relevant committee, to exclude a postgraduate student, Ms Tang, from a program leading to the award of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The decision was based on a finding that Ms Tang had engaged in academic misconduct. The relevant admission/exclusion, academic misconduct and appeal processes were the subject of policies adopted by the University Council. The policy documents were similar to the Guidelines in the sense that although the making of them was within the power and mandate of the Council as the University's governing body under the Griffith University Act 1998 (Qld), that Act did not refer, expressly or by implication, to the laying down of the policies. Rather, to do so was in the general power of the University Council as the body having the general functions and powers of management given it by the Act.

Ms Tang applied for review of the University's decision under the Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld). The issue was whether that decision was "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" a formula borrowed from the AD(JR) Act. The University sought summary dismissal. It failed at first instance in the Supreme Court of Queensland and then before the Queensland Court of Appeal.

The High Court, however, by a 4:1 majority, allowed the University's appeal. Two judgments were delivered by the Judges constituting the majority, one by Gleeson CJ and the other by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ ("joint judgment").

In their joint judgment in Tang , Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ pointed (at [60]) to dangers in looking at the expression "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" otherwise than as a whole. Their Honours quoted the following passage from Aronson MI, Dyer BD, Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, Lawbook Co, 2004) pp 73-74 (footnotes omitted): 
 
 The recent trend is to treat decisions which can find no other statutory source of authority than such a clause [giving power or even a duty to administer an Act and to do all things necessary in that regard] as not being made under an enactment for ADJR purposes, although there has been scant attempt to identify why that approach should be adopted as a matter of principle. (Original emphasis.)

Their Honours noted (at [78]) that while a decision, in order to be susceptible to review under the AD(JR) Act must be either expressly or by implication authorised or required by an enactment, requirement or authority is not alone sufficient. The further stipulation that the decision must be "of an administrative character" meant that there must be an affecting of legal rights and obligations. Their Honours said (at [80]): 
 
 Do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement [cf R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett at 154] ? To adapt what was said by Lehane J in Lewins [ ANU v Lewins at 103], does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations? Are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general law but by virtue of the statute? [ General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 169]. 
 

 
Mr O'Neill's decision does not derive from the ITAA a capacity to affect legal rights and obligations. Nor do legal rights (of the Commissioner) or duties (of the applicants) in relation to the production of Documents 226 to 238 "owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement": Tang at [80]. It is O 33 r 12 and the general law that give the Commissioner procedural rights and impose on the applicants procedural obligations.

Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ did not see it as an obstacle to their view the fact that the terms of the policy and other circumstances may well have created an expectation in Ms Tang that any withdrawal from her PhD candidature would only follow upon the fair treatment of complaints against her. Their Honours said (at [92]) that such an expectation would not create in Ms Tang any substantive rights under the general law, which would render the decision she challenged a decision made under the University's Act.

A similar observation is to be made in relation to the Guidelines. They are calculated to create an expectation that they will be adhered to by the Commissioner. However, that expectation does not convert a non-reviewable decision into a reviewable one.

The following summary paragraph (at [96] of the joint judgment in Tang ) concludes their Honours' discussion of the issues and immediately precedes their discussion of the orders to be made: 
 
 The decisions of which the respondent complains were authorised, albeit not required, by the University Act. The Committees involved depended for their existence and powers upon the delegation by the Council of the University under ss 6 and 11 of the University Act. But that does not mean that the decisions of which the respondent complains were "made under" the University Act in the sense required to make them reviewable under the Review Act. The decisions did not affect legal rights and obligations. They had no impact upon matters to which the University Act gave legal force and effect. The respondent enjoyed no relevant legal rights and the University had no obligations under the University Act with respect to the course of action the latter adopted towards the former. 
 

 
This passage applies, mutatis mutandis, to the Guidelines and to Mr O'Neill's decision under them.

I turn now to consider other authorities to which I was referred.

In Tang , Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ described (at [84]) as a "sound ground" of non-reviewability, Black CJ's reference to the Commissioner's voting decision as one that was not given statutory effect by s 8 of the ITAA.

For the reasons given above, the application is incompetent in so far as it relies on the AD(JR) Act. Sections 39B(1) and (1A) of the Judiciary Act

In this case the jurisdictional question under s 39B(1) is whether the proceeding is a matter in which certiorari or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. It is not suggested that the Commissioner and Mr O'Neill (an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation) are not such officers. The applicants seek an order quashing or setting aside Mr O'Neill's decision and an injunction restraining the respondents "from seeking access to" Documents 226 to 238. The Court therefore has jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act .

The question that remains in relation to s 39B(1) is whether the applicants have no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding (ie gaining the order and injunction they seek). In the present state of the evidence and exploration of the legal issues involved, I am not persuaded that they have no reasonable prospects of success of doing so.

<tocase>Hutchins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269</tocase>
<text>At [84] of the joint judgment, their Honours referred to Hutchins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269 (" Hutchins "). They referred with approval (at [84]) to a statement by Lockhart J in Hutchins (at 277) that the decision to vote at the meeting of creditors could not itself have conferred any benefit or imposed any disadvantage when it was made, and that any affecting of legal rights arose from the cumulative effect of the votes later cast at the meeting. The respondents submit that Mr O'Neill's decision should similarly be distinguished from the decision of a different officer of the ATO to issue the notice to produce.

I do not accept this particular submission. Mr O'Neill's decision was in a different position from that with which Hutchins was concerned. Lockhart J was emphasising that the Commissioner's decision to vote against the motion could not advance matters until the motion was voted upon at the meeting of creditors. In the present case, a decision to lift the concession was provided for in the Guidelines and it was within the power of the Commissioner alone to access Documents 226 to 238. In substance, it was the Commissioner who decided both to lift the concession and to enforce his right, as a litigant, of access to Documents 226 to 238. If the Guidelines had been an Act, the provision for the decision to lift the concession would have been comparable to the provision of the making of a finding that a licensee was no longer a fit and proper person to hold a commercial licence, for which the Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth) s 88(2) provided as the foundation of a decision to suspend or revoke such a licence, that was one of the decisions considered in ABT v Bond .

What is important, however, is that the Guidelines are not an "enactment", and the decision does not, by reason of them or of any enactment, immediately affect legal rights and obligations.

Mr O'Neill's decision would be reviewable as "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" if: 
(a) the ITAA provided for (in the relevant sense) the making of the Guidelines granting the concession;
 
(b) the Guidelines provided for the granting of the concession and for the making of the decision to lift it as a condition precedent to the taking of action to compel the giving of access;
 
(c) the Act or the Guidelines (the latter, within power) provided for the compelling of the giving of access.

Hutchins , referred to at [73], has much in common with the present case. The decision impugned was a decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to vote against a motion put at a meeting of creditors convened under Pt X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). The application was made under the AD(JR) Act. At first instance, Jenkinson J had upheld an objection to competency.

The applicant contended that the decision was made under one or more of ss 8, 208 and 209 of the ITAA.</text>

The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held, following Swain v Hillman and Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England , that the "no reasonable prospects of success" test requires the court to determine whether there are "real" as opposed to "fanciful" prospects of success: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] QCA 227 ; [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235. The New South Wales Court of Appeal had to consider the expression "reasonable prospects of success" as it occurred in s 198J of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) in Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 153 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 300. That section prohibited a solicitor or barrister from providing legal services on a claim or defence of a claim for damages unless the solicitor or barrister reasonably believed on the basis of provable facts and a reasonably arguable view of the law that the claim or the defence had reasonable prospects of success. Later subsections elaborated on the meaning of the prohibition. This fact, coupled with the fact that the prohibition was directed to the reasonable belief of the solicitor or barrister, renders the discussion not directly relevant to the summary dismissal context in which the court is required to determine if there are reasonable prospects of success following an inter partes hearing.</text>

<text>In some respects, the availability of review under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act is wider, and in some respects narrower, than that available under the AD(JR) Act. What is important for present purposes is that the notion of a "matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament" in s 39B(1)(c) of the Judiciary Act is wider than that of a "decision ... made under an enactment" of s 5 of the AD(JR) Act. Reference may be made to such cases as LNC Industries Ltd v BMW (Aust) Ltd [1983] HCA 31 ; (1983) 151 CLR 575 , Australian Solar Mesh Sales Pty Ltd v Anderson [2000] FCA 864 ; (2000) 101 FCR 1 , and ACTEW Corporation Ltd v Pangallo [2002] FCAFC 325 ; (2002) 127 FCR 1 , for an indication of the breadth of the concept of a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</text>

<text>Third, while s 31A of the FCA Act (mutatis mutandis, s 17A of the FM Act) achieves nothing of significance in relation to migration cases, it is of general application and therefore affects all proceedings brought in the Court. The question of the precise meaning of s 31A of the FCA Act and s 17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The most recent review of them of which I am aware is that of Driver FM on 19 March 2007 in Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157 at [18] - [28] . The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 701 IPR 146; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s 31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</text>

<tocase>ONE.TEL Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 101 FCR 548</tocase>
<text>The applicants rely on ONE.TEL Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 101 FCR 548 (" ONE.TEL ") in which there was an application to set aside notices given by the Commissioner under s 108 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 (Cth) ("the STAA") requiring the addressee to provide the Commissioner with information. A Deputy Commissioner of Taxation gave approval under the Guidelines to the seeking of access. Burchett J held, at [42], that the Guidelines gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the Commissioner would act in conformity with them. He held that the Commissioner was not at liberty to depart from them (except in such an urgent case as might arise if there were grounds for fearing destruction of the documents), without giving the person concerned an opportunity to make out a case why the Commissioner should not do so.

The applicants rely heavily on the decision of Burchett J in ONE.TEL . That case concerned an application to set aside notices issued under s 108 of the STAA. That section provided: 
 
 (1) The Commissioner may direct a person ... 
 (a) to provide the Commissioner with such information as the Commissioner requires; ... 
 for the purpose of enabling the Commissioner to apply the sales tax law in relation to the person, or in relation to any other person. 
 

 
Section 109 of the STAA provided that for the purposes of the sales tax law, an authorised officer was entitled to full and free access to documents at all reasonable times, and might inspect, examine, copy, or take extracts from, any document.

The Commissioner had issued "Guidelines for the Exercise of Access Powers in Relation to Accountants' Papers" ("the guidelines"). The title and the content were not identical with those of the Guidelines, but the substance of them was similar. Under the guidelines, a decision was made approving of access to certain documents of external accountants on the basis that exceptional circumstances existed.

Burchett J stated (at [42]) that the formality and detail of the guidelines and the nature of their subject matter strongly suggested that the guidelines created a legitimate expectation that the Commissioner would not depart from them without giving the person affected an opportunity to make out a case as to why he should not do so. In the event, however, his Honour stated that there had been no breach of natural justice in the circumstances.

His Honour also rejected (at [45]) a submission that the decision granting access was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have made it.

His Honour's reference to natural justice and to unreasonableness suggest that he may have been thinking in terms of s 5(1)(a) and s 5(1)(e) and (2)(g) of the AD(JR) Act, although he did not refer to that Act.

The report of ONE.TEL is in fact a report of his Honour's reasons for judgment in three proceedings brought by ONE.TEL Ltd against the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation NG 120 of 1998, NG 449 of 1998 and NG 33 of 1999. It is only the last that is of present relevance, in which the application was made for review of: 
 
 the decision or the conduct of the respondent made on or about 15 December 1998 to give approval for officers of the Commissioner of Taxation to have access under section 109 of the [STAA] to documents in the possession of the applicants. 
 

 
In oral submissions in that case, senior counsel for the Deputy Commissioner said that the reference to "conduct" had been included in case the view should be taken that the only relevant decision was the decision to issue the notice under s 108 of the STAA. In that case, so it was said, the antecedent decision to lift the concession was conduct that led to the making of that decision. In the present case the decision to allow access is attacked as a "decision" alone.

ONE.TEL Ltd asserted that it was aggrieved by the decision because it purported to give approval to officers of the Commissioner to have access under s 109 of the STAA to "restricted source" and "non-source" documents in breach of the guidelines. The application also referred to a breach of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness, and to other grounds mentioned in s 5 of the AD(JR) Act.

The Deputy Commissioner filed a notice of objection to competency on the grounds that the decision to give approval for access was not a decision made "under an enactment" and was also not "conduct", within the meaning of the AD(JR) Act. However, his Honour's reasons do not expressly refer to the objection to competency. In particular, they do not address the contention that the decision was not "made under an enactment".

It is difficult to know what to make of his Honour's reasons because they do not, with respect, expose clearly what the field of contest was in relation to the guidelines and the decision to lift the concession made under them, that his Honour was addressing.

The respondents submit that ONE.TEL is distinguishable because the decision to approve access was connected with the exercise of a statutory power, namely, the power given to the Commissioner by s 108 of the STAA to direct a person to produce documents to the Commissioner. I agree. In the present case, the decision to approve of access is a precursor of the exercise of a power that O 33 r 14 of the FCRs confers, not only on the Commissioner, but on all litigants before this Court.

As the issue as to competency was not addressed in Burchett J's reasons, I do not regard his Honour's decision as standing in the way of my giving effect to the view that I have formed.</text>

<tocase>R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett v Optiz (1945) 70 CLR 141</tocase>
<text>In relation to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , the Court has jurisdiction if, relevantly, there is a "matter" "arising under" a law made by the Parliament: s 39B(1A)(c). This test is satisfied only if "the right or duty in question in the matter owes its existence to federal law or depends on federal law for its enforcement": R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett v Optiz (1945) 70 CLR 141 at 154 (Latham CJ), and Felton v Mulligan (1971) 124 CLR 367 at 388 (Windeyer J). The Guidelines' lack of statutory status means that a dispute as to whether Mr O'Neill applied them correctly, or accorded procedural fairness before making his decision, does not give rise to any such matter. The submissions of the applicants (respondents to the motion)

Their Honours noted (at [78]) that while a decision, in order to be susceptible to review under the AD(JR) Act must be either expressly or by implication authorised or required by an enactment, requirement or authority is not alone sufficient. The further stipulation that the decision must be "of an administrative character" meant that there must be an affecting of legal rights and obligations. Their Honours said (at [80]): 
 
 Do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement [cf R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett at 154] ? To adapt what was said by Lehane J in Lewins [ ANU v Lewins at 103], does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations? Are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general law but by virtue of the statute? [ General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 169]. 
 

 
Mr O'Neill's decision does not derive from the ITAA a capacity to affect legal rights and obligations. Nor do legal rights (of the Commissioner) or duties (of the applicants) in relation to the production of Documents 226 to 238 "owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement": Tang at [80]. It is O 33 r 12 and the general law that give the Commissioner procedural rights and impose on the applicants procedural obligations.</text>

<tocase>R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835</tocase>
<text>I need not recount in further detail the claims of estoppel, unfairness and waiver. In relation to "substantive unfairness", the applicants cite R v Inland Revenue Commissioner; Ex parte Preston [1984] UKHL 5 ; [1985] AC 835 at 866 7 (Templeman LJ) (for the principle that judicial review may be warranted where a commissioner's decision is unfair and amounting to a breach of contract or breach of representation, and therefore within the ambit of an abuse of power). They acknowledge the note of caution in relation to this principle that was sounded by Lehane J in Daihatsu Australia Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 239 (" Daihatsu ") at [51] (that note of caution being that such a principle has not been the subject of extended consideration by Australian courts), but say that at the trial, they will submit that the principles of administrative law in Australia are developing to take account of a form of doctrine of substantive unfairness of the kind described by Lord Templeman.

<tocase>Scharer v State of New South Wales [2001] NSWCA 360 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 299</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2001/360.html</AustLII>
<text>At [18], the Chief Justice referred to Scharer v State of New South Wales [2001] NSWCA 360 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 299 , in which Davies A-JA said (at 313) that under the AD(JR) Act: 
 
 The crux of the issue in each case is whether the enactment has played a relevant part in affecting or effecting rights or obligations. A grant of authority to do that which under the general law a person has authority to do is not regarded as sufficient. 
 

 
The right to require production of Documents 226 to 238 is given by O 33 r 12 which applies to any party to any proceeding before this Court. The same can be said of other procedural rights given by the FCRs directly, or of the right given by them to apply for a procedural benefit of one kind or another, such as the right to apply for leave to issue a subpoena or the right to apply for an order for discovery.

Gleeson CJ held that the termination of Ms Tang's candidature occurred under the general law and under the terms and conditions on which the University was willing to enter into a relationship with her, and added (at [23]): 
 
 The power to formulate those terms and conditions, to decide to enter into the relationship, and to decide to end it, was conferred in general terms by the Griffith University Act , but the decision to end the relationship was not given legal force or effect by that Act. 
 

 
Mr O'Neill's decision was one step antecedent to the decision (by a different officer) to give the notice to produce. Mr O'Neill's decision to exclude Documents 226 to 238 from the scope of the concession can be usefully compared to a decision provided for by the Griffith University's policy that a candidate had been guilty of academic misconduct. Such a decision would have gained nothing in terms of susceptibility to judicial review by reason of its being distinct from the decision to exclude a student; likewise, Mr O'Neill's decision to allow access to Documents 226 to 238 vis-a-vis the decision to give the notice to produce them in the appeal proceedings.</text>
