<text>5 On 19 April 2004, I gave directions in the proceeding, including a direction that the applicant file and serve any amended application, with proper particulars of the grounds relied upon. I also granted a certificate pursuant to O 80 of the Federal Court Rules , so that the applicant could receive legal advice from a barrister. Counsel who ultimately appeared for the applicant accepted the referral. An amended draft order nisi was filed, in which prohibition was sought against the Minister, and certiorari and mandamus against the Tribunal, although the Tribunal was still not named as a respondent to the proceeding. Remedies cannot be sought against the Tribunal unless it is named as a respondent, so it will be necessary for me to make orders adding the Tribunal as a respondent, with consequential amendments to the documents filed. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 .

6 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act '), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms 'Refugees Convention' and 'Refugees Protocol' are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967. It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the 'Convention'. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who:
 

 
 'owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country'.

7 Section 91R of the Migration Act provides relevantly as follows:
 

 
 '(1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations 
 to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as 
 amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to 
 persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article 
 unless: 
 
 ... 
 
 (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and 

 ... 
 
 (2) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph 
 (1)(b), the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes 
 of that paragraph: 
 
 (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; 
 
 (b) significant physical harassment of the person; 
 
 (c) significant physical ill-treatment of the person; 
 
 (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's 
 capacity to subsist; 
 
 (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens 
 the person's capacity to subsist; 
 
 (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the 
 denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist.'</text>

<tocase>Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1641.html</AustLII>
<text>21 Counsel for the Minister argued that, at least as to part of the relief claimed, the application was out of time under the High Court Rules 1952 ('the High Court rules') and, unless the Court extended the time, that relief could not be granted. As I have said, the relief sought against the Minister is prohibition. The High Court Rules contained no time limit in respect of an application for prohibition. Counsel for the Minister contended that it was inappropriate to seek prohibition against the Minister; once the Tribunal decision has been made, if it is not set aside, the Minister has a statutory obligation to remove the applicant from Australia. While this argument may be correct, it is of no consequence in the present case. It is conceded that, as against the Tribunal, the remedy of certiorari was sought by the filing of the application in the High Court within the time limit then fixed by O 55 r 17(1) of the High Court Rules. The application to the High Court was not filed within the two-month time limit, fixed by O 55 r 30 of the High Court Rules, in respect of an application for mandamus. In Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 at [73] , after examining some of the authorities, I expressed the conclusion that the better view is that, once the High Court has remitted an application for an order nisi to this Court, the time limits applicable in that court are no longer of any consequence. I remain of that opinion.

22 In any event, there was an amended draft order nisi filed in this Court. Although the use of an amended draft order nisi was perhaps not the most convenient procedure, it was of itself sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, conferred by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , afresh. On the assumption that the Tribunal's decision is affected by jurisdictional error, and is consequently not 'a decision...made...under this Act' for the purposes of the definition of 'privative clause decision' in s 474(2) of the Migration Act , the time limit then fixed by s 477(1) was inapplicable. On that assumption, there was no time limit fixed for invoking the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , in respect of the Tribunal's decision. See Applicants M16 at [74].

23 If it were necessary to enlarge the time limit for the application for mandamus, to give the applicant a constitutional entitlement to seek certiorari as an adjunct to mandamus (certiorari being a remedy not mentioned in s 75(v) of the Constitution ), then I should not hesitate to do so in the present case. There has been no undue delay. The proceeding was commenced within the time limited for an application for certiorari. The delay is not, in any event, gross. The Minister has not claimed to have suffered any prejudice by reason of the delay. The applicant's claim is one that has merits.

24 An alternative view is that certiorari might be a remedy available to the applicant, pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), in a proceeding in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked validly by the remittal by the High Court of the application for prohibition against the Minister, even if the applicant could not succeed in obtaining that remedy against that respondent.

25 For all these reasons, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of the time of the commencement of the proceeding any further.

26 The applicant's case included a number of facts which, if accepted, distinguished him from most, if not all, of the people dealt with by the Egyptian authorities as a result of the activities at the nightclub. At the time of the events, the applicant was not a teenager, but was in his mid-twenties. He was not merely attending the events at which what were regarded as satanic rituals were taking place, but was facilitating those events, by making videotapes, and ensuring that the memory of the events was kept alive, by selling the videotapes to the participants. It was perhaps true to say, as the Tribunal did, that he was not an 'organiser' of the events, but he was certainly not in the same category as the ordinary participants.</text>
