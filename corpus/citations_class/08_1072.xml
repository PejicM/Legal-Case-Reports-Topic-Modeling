<tocase>Meadow Springs v Balanced Securities (2007) 25 ACLC 1 ,433</tocase>
<text>3 Mr Buckley helpfully referred me to a recent decision of French J, Meadow Springs v Balanced Securities (2007) 25 ACLC 1 ,433. In that case French J at [48] pointed out that a direction given or a question determined under s 511 would protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination. His Honour thought it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are named as defendants in the application, but neither direction nor determination gives rise to a res judicata as between parties who may have competing interests affected by it.</text>
