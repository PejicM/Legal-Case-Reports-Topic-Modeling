<text>Finally, Mr Bodenstein complained that the Tribunal should have deferred its consideration of the matter until the determination of the Supreme Court proceedings. No doubt it could have done so. However a failure by it so to do discloses no error, still less jurisdictional error. There may, of course, be circumstances in which a failure to adjourn may result in a breach of s 357A(3) of a kind analogous to a denial of procedural fairness: cf Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at 365 per Hely J. However, no such issue arises here.

The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

<tocase>Bodenstein v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 630</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/630.html</AustLII>
<text>Introduction
 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 20 May 2008: Bodenstein v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 630. That Court rejected the appellants' application for orders setting aside a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") handed down on 1 August 2007. The Tribunal had affirmed a prior decision by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister") not to grant the present appellants' application for visas. In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Facts

The appellants, whom without any disrespect I shall refer to as the Bodensteins, are Israeli nationals and are a family. Mr Bodenstein arrived in Australia on 2 September 2003. On the same day he lodged an application for a "Temporary Business Entry (Class UC)" visa. That class of visa permits a non-citizen with skills needed by Australian businesses to enter and work temporarily in Australia. The letters "UC" are not an acronym and have no special meaning other than as a class designator. The class UC visa may be granted for a period of up to three months, in which case it is called a Subclass 456 (Business (Short Stay)) visa. Alternatively, it may be granted to permit a stay of more than three months but less than four years, in which case it is called a Subclass 457 (Business (Long Stay)) visa. Mr Bodenstein, and his family as dependents, applied for the Subclass 457 (Business (Long Stay)) visa.

The power of the Minister to grant a visa is conferred by s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act"). It provides: 
 (1) After considering a valid application for a visa, the Minister:
 (a) if satisfied that: 

(i) the health criteria for it (if any) have been satisfied; and
 
(ii) the other criteria for it prescribed by this Act or the regulations have been satisfied; and
 
(iii) the grant of the visa is not prevented by section 40 (circumstances when granted), 500A (refusal or cancellation of temporary safe haven visas), 501 (special power to refuse or cancel) or any other provision of this Act or of any other law of the Commonwealth; and
 
(iv) any amount of visa application charge payable in relation to the application has been paid;
 
is to grant the visa; or
 
(b) if not so satisfied, is to refuse to grant the visa.</text>

<text>First, the requirements of procedural fairness (or, as it was formerly known, natural justice) required the Bodensteins to be given an opportunity to put their case to the federal magistrate. That opportunity was afforded to them. Although it has been held that in certain circumstances a serious criminal proceeding may be stayed if an accused person is not afforded legal representation, it is apparent that that power is a manifestation of the Court's power to stay an unfair criminal trial: Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 311 per Mason CJ and McHugh J, 361-362 per Toohey J, 365 per Gaudron J. However, Dietrich is not concerned with civil proceedings. More importantly, it has been held that the rules of procedural fairness in civil proceedings do not extend to requiring the provision of legal representation: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 330-331 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ; cf Rivera v United States of America [2004] FCAFC 154 at [26] - [28] per Heerey, Sundberg and Crennan JJ.</text>

<text>Secondly, even if that were not so, Mr Bodenstein has shown no error in the way the federal magistrate dealt with the application for referral. Although I express no concluded view on the matter, it is likely that an attack on the exercise of the power in r 12.03 would need to comply with the principles enunciated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499. In particular it would be necessary to show that the federal magistrate approached the exercise of the power on an erroneous basis or took into account some extraneous consideration or failed to take into account some essential matter. This ground must be rejected.

Mr Bodenstein's second complaint about the Federal Magistrates Court was that it had exceeded its jurisdiction. In essence his point was that by permitting the Tribunal's decision not to grant the visas to stand, the federal magistrate was effectively pre-emptorily terminating the Supreme Court proceedings because without Mr Bodenstein here to prosecute them they would inevitably be dismissed. I would accept that, generally speaking, the Federal Magistrates Court has no power to dismiss Supreme Court proceedings. However, that is not what the federal magistrate did. Both before and after his decision those proceedings remained on foot.

A variant of this argument was that the federal magistrate's decision undermined the exercise by the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction. There may well be some circumstances where the removal of a litigant from the jurisdiction might be a contempt of the court seized with the litigation. However, the removal of an alien by force of federal law could never be a contempt of purely state court proceedings. This ground too must therefore be rejected.
