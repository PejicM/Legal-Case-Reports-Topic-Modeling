<tocase>Andjelkovic v AFG Insurances Ltd (1980) 47 FLR 348</tocase>
<text>5 In light of section 6 of the LR Act, the parties to the present interlocutory application agreed that the threshold issue arising is whether the foreshadowed claim for the application of a statutory charge on the part of the Insurers in favour of PCL is reasonably arguable. If the claim is reasonably arguable in the sense that it 'could be seriously put' ( Andjelkovic v AFG Insurances Ltd (1980) 47 FLR 348 at 356 per Blackburn CJ, the context whereof involved an issue as to statutory or alternatively contractual interpretation), then leave should be granted to join the Insurers, or at least that Insurer resident in Australia being of course Macquarie, notwithstanding its purported agency status, so that the issue as to availability of the statutory remedy referrable to the prevailing circumstances may be subsequently resolved at a final hearing of the proceedings. The parties further agreed that for the purposes of the present interlocutory application of PCL, the following general principles apply:
 
 (i) an action pursuant to section 6 of the LR Act cannot be commenced of course without the leave of the Court, and whilst some specific circumstances may be identified as operative against the grant of leave, any grant of leave or otherwise falls ultimately within the statutory discretion thereby vested in the Court; and 


 
 (ii) the Court will not grant leave to commence proceedings in circumstances where on the basis of the material placed before the Court, the claim of an applicant for the statutory indemnity sought is not reasonably arguable.

42 I have reached the conclusion, subject to provision of evidence formally as to Mr Teves' status as a director and shareholder of PCL at the material times, being a circumstance of course asserted by PCL, that PCL has demonstrated satisfaction of the test exemplified in Andjelkovic, and subsequently as articulated more expansively in Fishwives , in relation to both successive insurance policies, and that it would be erroneous on my part to shut out PCL from pursing its presently framed causes of action at this interlocutory stage upon the demurrable basis advanced on behalf of the Insurers. I think that I should exercise my discretion in favour of the grant of the leave sought in relation to the operation of both policies, and thus in relation to the successive years of indemnity from 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004 and from 26 July 2004 to 2005. The addition of SVB as a respondent is more problematical, but I gained the ultimate understanding that no objection would be raised in principle to the inclusion of SVB as an additional respondent, apparently as a representative of the individual Lloyds underwriters involved.</text>

<tocase>Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd &amp; Ors (2002) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-515</tocase>
<text>6 More recently in the context of an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (2002) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-515, Mason P (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) described the operation of the applicable principle in the following more comprehensive terms:
 
 
 '47. I do not accept the appellant's submission that the judge was bound to grant leave if there was an arguable case on the non-disclosure issue. I can readily accept that leave may be given where the Court is satisfied that there is an arguable point on the insurer's indemnity issue. It is now established that the grant of leave to proceed against an insurer does not foreclose the insurer's right to litigate issues going to its liability to indemnify the insured in the substantive proceedings.... But it does not follow, in my view, that a court that is positively satisfied of the insurer's entitlement to disclaim, after issue has been joined on that matter as between the plaintiff and the insurer, must exercise the discretion in favour of the grant of leave. The court is "seized of the discretion to grant leave" (National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1996) 9 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-335 at 76,711; (1996) 138 ALR 409 at 418 per Lindgren J), but it is not driven to exercise the discretion in a particular way.' 
 


The outcome of the appeal in that case was summarised by Mason P as follows:
 
 
 
 
 '48. In the present case Delaney DCJ was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the insurer was entitled to disclaim. He was in my view entitled to reach this conclusion.' 
 


In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeal was presented with findings below as to facts establishing the objective falsity to answers provided in the insurance proposal form. It is the case of the Insurers on the present application of PCL for joinder of Macquarie and also SVB as additional respondents to the proceedings that I should find on the balance of probabilities that the Insurers are entitled to disclaim liability, and therefore that leave to join the Insurers should be refused.

7 PCL's business included the provision of loans to assist the funding of the purchase of real property, the loans being usually secured by mortgage over that real property. On 22 May 2003, ARMA provided valuations for mortgage lending purposes to PCL as prospective mortgagee in respect of two adjacent freehold properties comprising Lots 15 and 20 at Nos 22-24 Oyster Court Trinity Beach in the State of Queensland. The valuations were apparently signed by Mr Teves on behalf of ARMA, though the valuations were not tendered into evidence, the view understandably taken by the parties being that the same were not material to the resolution of the present interlocutory proceedings.

8 It is PCL's case that in reliance on those valuations, it lent to the freehold owner Brett Robinson the sum of $598,000 secured by way of registered first mortgage over the properties, and that when the freehold owner defaulted under the mortgage, PCL exercised its power of sale as mortgagee and sold the properties, thereby sustaining a shortfall in the available proceeds of sale in relation to the moneys by then secured by PCL's mortgage. PCL's case was further that the valuations were provided to PCL by the respondents ARMA and Mr Teves in breach of sections 52 and 53A of the TP Act, for the reason that the valuations substantially overstated the market values of the properties and those existing respondents did not have reasonable grounds for their assessments of market value. PCL has claimed damages in the first instance against ARMA as the provider of the valuations and Mr Teves as the author of the valuations, he being allegedly also a director of ARMA, but it is apparent that recovery from ARMA and Mr Teves individually is at least dubious.

42 I have reached the conclusion, subject to provision of evidence formally as to Mr Teves' status as a director and shareholder of PCL at the material times, being a circumstance of course asserted by PCL, that PCL has demonstrated satisfaction of the test exemplified in Andjelkovic, and subsequently as articulated more expansively in Fishwives , in relation to both successive insurance policies, and that it would be erroneous on my part to shut out PCL from pursing its presently framed causes of action at this interlocutory stage upon the demurrable basis advanced on behalf of the Insurers. I think that I should exercise my discretion in favour of the grant of the leave sought in relation to the operation of both policies, and thus in relation to the successive years of indemnity from 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004 and from 26 July 2004 to 2005. The addition of SVB as a respondent is more problematical, but I gained the ultimate understanding that no objection would be raised in principle to the inclusion of SVB as an additional respondent, apparently as a representative of the individual Lloyds underwriters involved.</text>

<tocase>FAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney ((1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-443</tocase>
<text>24 The Insurers rejoined that the words 'circumstances which might result in a claim' the subject of exclusion clause 4.1 of each policy included circumstances where a claim is possible in the sense, for instance, of being contingent upon crystallisation of some event, and that if such was not the case, there could never be any circumstances, short of the making of a claim per se , which could constitute circumstances which might result in a claim. The respondents drew attention to FAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney ((1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-443 at 75,033-4), where this Court (Lindgren J) gave consideration to a policy condition containing a similar expression ' may give rise to a claim', and expressed the opinion that although it was not desirable to attempt to define precisely the shade of meaning to be signified by that expression in particular contexts, circumstances may be said to give rise to a claim if ' they would... immediately suggest to a reasonable person in the... insured's position who reflected upon those known circumstances, that the bringing of a claim against the insured in respect of them was a "definite risk" or a "real possibility" or "on the cards". It was therefore contended by the Insurers the second policy 'does not respond' to the claim of ARMA as valuer and hence also to that of PCL as mortgagee .

25 As appears further from the text of the letter dated 13 May 2004 which I have earlier extracted in full, it contains the opinion '[i]t appears your valuations significantly overvalued the properties, such that our client may suffer a shortfall upon sale of the properties' , and the statement of intention that '[w]e have been instructed to take action to recover any shortfall from you'. Moreover this letter warned '... that circumstances have arisen that may give rise, to a claim', being words reflected in the fourth indented paragraph of exclusion clause 4.1 of each of the first and second policies. The letter dated 23 April 2004 is to similar effect.</text>

<tocase>Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Proprietary Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/82.html</AustLII>
<text>26 PCL drew attention to the well known principle of insurance law that an exclusion clause in an insurance policy should be construed narrowly and otherwise against the interests of the insurer, citing in that regard Derrington and Ashton, The Law of Liability Insurance (2 nd edition Lexis Nexis, 2005) at 10-2. PCL referred further to the principle enunciated in the unanimous reasons for judgment of the High Court in Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Proprietary Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 to the effect that in the event of ambiguity, an exclusion clause is to be construed contra proferentem . I have already extracted the material provisions of exclusion clause 4.1 of potential relevance. Given the content of the letters of PCL to Mr Teves, apparently a director and shareholder of ARMA during the term of the first policy (as well as the second policy), yet the absence of any sale of the properties the subject of ARMA's valuations prior to commencement of the second policy, being letters apparently not provided to Macquarie prior to the commencement of the term of the second policy, the Insurers contended that if the second policy was otherwise the subject of relevant cover, that absence of disclosure by ARMA to Macquarie of those notifications of apparent likely claim communicated by PCL to ARMA was fatal to invocation of any liability of the Insurers under the second policy.

27 It was PCL's further contention however that s 33 (of Division 3 of Part IV) of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) ('IC Act') so operates as to preclude, in the present circumstances, the Insurers from any effective reliance upon exclusion clause 4.1. Section 33, which is headed 'No other remedies' , stipulates as follows: 
 
 'The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement.'</text>

<tocase>Permanent Trustee Australia Limited v FAI Insurance Company Limited (1988) 153 ALR 529</tocase>
<text>28 PCL submitted that if exclusion clause 4.1 was to be applied adversely to PCL, it would effectively provide an additional right to Macquarie/SVB that they have 'otherwise than under [the IC Act] in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or an incorrect statement' , and thus should be invalidated by reason of the operation of s 33 of the IC Act. PCL cited in that regard Permanent Trustee Australia Limited v FAI General Insurance Company Limited (1988) 153 ALR 529, where Hodgson CJ in Eq considered a policy condition, extracted at 536 under the heading ' Retroactive Liability ', which was claimed to have granted unlimited retroactive liability, qualified only by the words ' omitting claims or circumstances which may give rise to a claim which are known to the insured prior to the inception of this insurance' . PCL contended that such exclusion condition addressed in FAI was 'on all fours' with exclusion clause 4.1 of each of the present policies, and that what was addressed by his Honour was indeed the substance rather than the form of the exclusion clause there in issue. His Honour determined (at 568) that '... the retroactive clause should be interpreted as applying only if the insured knows the circumstances as circumstances which might give rise to a claim (being his Honour's emphasis), because otherwise the clause would have the unreasonable effect of excluding many or even most circumstances that were purportedly insured against'. Subsequently (at 589), his Honour added that '[i]f the retroactive clause had the effect of excluding liability for something which was in substance a non-disclosure, then I think s 33 would in any event, prevent the retroactive clause excluding liability'. PCL's submissions was that '... the only way that [Macquarie and SVB] can escape the making of the orders sought is... to persuade [the Federal Court] that Hodgson J... was wrong' in his approach to the resolution of Permanent Trustee .</text>

<tocase>Pech v Tilgals (1994) 94 ATC 4206</tocase>
<text>29 Counsel for the Insurers Macquarie and SVB drew attention to the reasons for subsequent decision of Dunford J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Pech v Tilgals (1994) 94 ATC 4206, where the circumstances involved a claim against an accountant for professional negligence, and a cross-claim by that accountant for indemnity against his professional indemnity insurer. The professional indemnity insurance policy excluded from cover claims '[a]rising from any circumstance or circumstances of which [the insured] shall became aware, prior to the commencement of insurance cover under this Policy... and which a reasonable Accountant in [the] position [of the insured] would at any time prior to the commencement of cover have considered may give rise to Claim' . His Honour first observed that the words '"at any time" (prior to the commencement of cover)' did not embrace circumstances which may have existed some time previously but which had been overtaken by subsequent events, as such a construction could at times lead to absurd results; rather in his Honour's view, those words referred to what a reasonable accountant should consider right down to the commencement of cover.

30 Assuming that policy language addressed in Pech to have relevantly similar effect as that of exclusion clause 4.1, two observations may be made. The first is that his Honour's observation cited above would have no application in relation to the operation of the first policy, but only the operation of the second policy, since the letters of 23 April 2004 and 13 May 2004 were written by PCL to Mr Teves during the currency of the first policy. The second is that the critical issue remains here as to the import of what was said in those letters concerning the implications as to what appear to have then constituted merely pending or proposed sales, rather than the implications of sales effected during that subsequent year of indemnity commencing 26 July 2004. It does not seem to me that Pech provides sufficient bearing upon the circumstances thus far in evidence in the present case.

31 PCL submitted next that s 14 of the IC Act, headed 'Parties not to rely on provisions except in the utmost good faith' , was also applicable to the present circumstances of claim, it providing by subsection (1) that '[i]f reliance by a party to a contract of insurance on a provision of the contract would be to fail to act with the utmost good faith, the party may not rely on the provision' . PCL's submission was that 'the effect of what the insurer seeks to do by relying on the exclusion is to penalise the insured for failing to notify the insurer of circumstances that might give rise to a claim during the previous policy year'. PCL asserted that the previous policy year of indemnity did not contain any provision that required the insured to notify any such circumstances. Accordingly PCL contended that '... where an insured is covered under successive policies of insurance, it is arguably a breach of duty of utmost good faith to rely on [an] exclusion which relates to the failure of the insured to perform an act during the prior policy of insurance when in fact there was no obligation of the insured pursuant to the prior policy to perform that act, namely to notify those circumstances'. The Insurers asserted on the other hand that PCL did not demonstrate 'how reliance upon a well known limitation in a claims made cover could amount to a lack of good faith', though no explicit evidence has yet been tendered as to the existence of the limitation being 'well known'.

32 PCL advanced an alternative claim for indemnity based on the first policy, that being of course issued by Macquarie to ARMA for the period of cover 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004. It appears to have been common ground that the valuations the subject of the present proceedings were undertaken and signed by Mr Teves, who was not a named valuer in the so-called special conditions appearing on page 1 of the Schedule to the first policy, the only valuer named therein being Terrence Stewart (as I have earlier recorded). Upon that basis, the Insurers' case was that the first policy did not provide insurance in relation to the circumstances of PCL's claim, the first policy not extending to valuations undertaken and signed by persons other than 'Terrence Stewart' , and hence not extending to valuations undertaken and signed by 'Neil Teves' . The Insurers submitted that there was no averment or evidence at all about Mr Teves' role or association with ARMA at the time of the commencement of operation of the first policy, or about 'any negotiations between the insured and the insurer relating to the decision to name Mr Stewart (and not Mr Teves) in the policy', and that there was therefore no basis, pleaded or otherwise, for the proposition that the first policy was intended to include valuations undertaken or signed by Mr Teves.

33 PCL invoked reliance by way of rejoinder to those submissions of the Insurers upon the remedial provisions s 14 of the IC Act, appearing within Part II thereof under the heading 'The duty of the utmost good faith' , and which read as follows:
 
 '14 Parties not to rely on provisions except in the utmost good faith 
 
 
 
 
 (1) If reliance by a party to a contract of insurance on a provision of the contract would be to fail to act with the utmost good faith, the party may not rely on the provision. 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not limit the operation of section 13. 
 
 (3) In deciding whether reliance by an insurer on a provision of the contract of insurance would be to fail to act with the utmost good faith, the court shall have regard to any notification of the provision that was given to the insured, whether a notification of a kind mentioned in section 37 or otherwise.' 
 
 


The preceding s 13 relates to the contracts of insurance being 'based on the utmost good faith' , and s 37 requires an insured to be 'clearly informed' in writing by the insurer of the effect of terms 'not usually included in contracts of insurance that provide similar insurance cover' .

34 PCL asserted that the purpose of ARMA in obtaining professional indemnity insurance from Macquarie was inferentially to acquire cover in respect of valuations conducted in the course of its business, and PCL informed the Court, seemingly without objection, that Mr Teves had been at all relevant times both a company director and a shareholder of ARMA. Upon that apparent footing of Mr Teves' involvement in ARMA to the extent of being a director and shareholder, PCL contended that 'given Mr Teves' position at ARMA, it is improbable in the extreme that his name was omitted from the schedule otherwise than by mistake or oversight'. However the Insurers drew attention to the circumstance that there had been no evidence tendered as to Mr Teves' role or association with ARMA at the time of commencement of the first policy. It would be inappropriate nevertheless to permit the present proceedings to be by interlocutory strike-out by reason largely of an apparent oversight on the part of PCL to have attended to such an evidentiary formality. One difficulty for PCL, so the Insurers contended in any event, was that no evidence had been provided to enable the Court to determine whether s 14 of the IC Act operates to preclude the proposed respondents from relying on such a mistake or oversight, being evidence for the purpose of proceedings for rectification of the first policy. Nevertheless it would be an unsatisfactory approach on my part to the resolution of the present interlocutory application to uphold the same in circumstances where there had emerged an apparency of a potentially viable basis for rectification of the first policy, albeit that such an evidently available course had not yet been formally commenced.</text>
