<tocase>Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/3.html</AustLII>
<text>21 Contempt of court, including that species of contempt which consists of the breach of orders or of the court or undertakings to the court, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534, 548.

22 All contempts are criminal in nature (183 CLR at 534). The court approaches in the adjudication of charges of contempt on the basis that criminal standards of proof and specificity apply. In this case the respondent, as was his right, did not himself give evidence although he tendered some documents.

23 The genesis of the orders made by Wilcox J appears to have been a handwritten heads of agreement signed by the director of the applicant, Mr Dowe, and Mr Monamy following the conclusion of mediation conducted with registrars of the court on 12 December 2005. The respondent has referred to that document as informing his interpretation of the orders.

24 Paragraph 3 of the handwritten document has a number of interlineations in different handwriting but significantly it sets out, in what appears to me to be unarguably clear words, the requirement that the respondent change his registered business name to 'Simply Natural Floor Coverings' (with 'Floor' and 'Coverings' written as two words each commencing with a capital letter) and use this business name on all advertising, letterhead, promotions and the like in lieu of 'Simply Natural Floorcoverings' (written as three words).

25 The respondent raised issues as to the fact that he was not personally present when Wilcox J made the orders and that he was in dispute with his then solicitor as to whether he had agreed to the orders being made in the terms in which they were made. Exhibit 7 contains some material which supports the proposition that there was some dispute between Mr Monamy and his solicitor on that topic.</text>

<tocase>Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/77.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The difficulty with the formulation of the finding of contempt contained in paragraph 2 of the statement of charge is that it relies on evidence of a number of disparate acts which changed over a period. There is a real possibility that there may be some duplicity in the charge as formulated, having regard to the evidence that I have recited. In Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 489-491 Dixon J made clear that a prosecutor had to specify with precision the precise act or omission relied on to constitute the particular contravention charged. That case involved a situation in which a prosecution had been brought alleging that within a particular time period a person had left licensed premises in breach of s 209(1) in the Licensing Act 1932-1935 (SA). The evidence tendered at the hearing revealed that there were many persons who had left during that time, but the prosecutor could not identify which of those many persons was relied on as the person whose departure evidenced the contravention. The charge was found bad for duplicity on that basis.

35 Here it seems to me that the applicant is relying on a number of events and different appearances of the website. I think that in fairness to the respondent the applicant must elect which particular instance it wishes to claim is a contravention and to allow the respondent an opportunity to answer in respect of that instance. I will defer making any final decision on that matter because I did not raise this issue with Mr Freeman when he was addressing.

36 This charge relates to order 3. It is plain beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent used the word 'Floorcoverings' as one word on his [advertising or] webpage until some time prior to 4 April 2006. If I am wrong in my conclusion that the ordinary reasonable person would not perceive a difference in the depiction because of the small space on the website that now appears between the word 'floor' and the word 'covering', I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, in fact, for the reasons, that I have expressed the respondent, to date, uses 'Floorcoverings' as one word. I am fortified in that conclusion by the fact that I regard the construction of order 3 as being relevantly aided by reference to order 4 which required the respondent immediately to change his business name to one in which the words 'Floor Coverings' appeared as two words with their first letters capitalised.</text>

<tocase>Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc v Gutnick [2002] HCA 56 ; (2002) 210 CLR 575</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/56.html</AustLII>
<text>43 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent has failed to publish any form of disclaimer on the website and that the use of the HTML meta tag is a deliberate evasion of the obligation to publish something that is able to be read in the ordinary way on the website. The contents of the HTML meta tag are not and at no time have been published on the website. What was required by order 5 was that there be published a disclaimer, that is it, be put forward in a form which actually communicated it. The act of publication in a bilateral act of someone putting forward a message and another person being able to read it and actually reading it. In this context it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that the order required that that the publication, in the sense of something which the person accessing the page would see and be able to read then and there, would occur whenever the page was opened. See Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc v Gutnick [2002] HCA 56 ; (2002) 210 CLR 575 at 600-601 [26] - [28] .

44 The order in my view, beyond reasonable doubt, should be construed as requiring the disclaimer referred to appear in a way which is immediately apparent on the website in words that can be read in the English language by anyone who opens the webpage. An ordinary and natural reading of the order dictates that construction.

45 I did raise with Mr Freeman the possibility that order 5 was or contained an ambiguity in the sense that the words 'above the fold' were to my mind, and I think on the evidence, meaningless without expert evidence or other evidence as to what they conveyed. I have seen in the evidence copies of the website and I am unable to detect from viewing them what it is that might be referred to as 'above the fold' in the order. However, I am satisfied that this ambiguity makes no difference whatsoever to the construction of the order in the sense that it was a requirement of the order that there be prominence on the website in the position of the disclaimer and that it be published.</text>
