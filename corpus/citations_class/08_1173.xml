<tocase>BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>28 The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other.

32 The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also, in my view, do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s 35.

33 BHP Petroleum concerned the eligibility of certain taxpayers under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 (Cth) to have their projects combined so that expenditure on one of the combined projects could be set off against revenue from another. Section 20 empowered the Minister to "... issue a combination certificate" if satisfied, having regard to specified factors, that the projects "are sufficiently related to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a single petroleum project". The application for the "combination certificate" had to be made "from" a person or persons who were together entitled to at least half of the receipts from the sale of marketable petroleum commodities produced in relation to each of the projects. The formal application, by oversight, omitted the name of one intended applicant whose entitlement was necessary to meet the one half eligibility criterion. In the circumstances, the Court (Beaumont, Jenkinson and Heerey JJ) found that the application had in fact been made by all the intended applicants, so that criterion was satisfied. Beaumont J at 170-171 explained that the word "from" had its ordinary meaning as indicating "the starting point, source or origin" of the application. That source had been clearly exposed by other communications. I do not, however, see any observations in the reasons which support the claimed contrast between "business activity" and "business". However, I think the meaning of the word "from" as discussed is equally applicable to that word in the phrase "from the business activity".

49 The relevant distinction which is drawn by s 35 is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year. Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it. Beaumont J (with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed) in BHP Petroleum at 170-171 applied the normal sense of a starting point, source or origin. Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received. As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech . In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy. I do not need to decide that question.</text>

<text>28 The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other.

32 The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also, in my view, do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s 35.

34 Watson concerned the claim of Mr Watson and his wife for benefits under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). Section 1075(1) provided that "if a person carries on a business, the person's ordinary income from the business is to be reduced by ... losses and outcomings that relate to the business ...". Mr Watson was refused benefits because the payments under the PIP policy were not part of his ordinary income from his financial planning business, so as to allow the reduction for the losses and outgoings of the business. Consequently, the statutory threshold for eligibility for benefits was exceeded. Mr Watson argued, in that case, that the benefits under the PIP policy had the same character as the income they replaced, particularly as (he claimed) he had to continue to work in the business or in some other remunerative employment as a prerequisite to being paid partial disability payments. Finn J at 569 upheld the conclusion that the payments under the PIP policy were not "ordinary income from the business". The contractual income was a surrogate for, and was payable because of, the reduced ordinary income from the business. The distinction drawn by Finn J is helpful in addressing the present appeal. In that regard, Finn J did not appear to place especial weight on the word "ordinary" in his reasoning. However, I do not think his Honour's views support the contrast between "business" and "business activity" which was contended for.

49 The relevant distinction which is drawn by s 35 is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year. Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it. Beaumont J (with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed) in BHP Petroleum at 170-171 applied the normal sense of a starting point, source or origin. Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received. As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech . In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy. I do not need to decide that question.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry (1998) 193 CLR 604</tocase>
<text>25 The PIP partial disability payments received by Mr Watson for the year ended 30 June 2004 are clearly part of his assessable income: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578. That is common ground. So too is the nature of Mr Watson's business activity during that year. It was that of a financial planner, although (as he says) that required administration and regulation compliance activities, each of which did not directly result in the earning of income. That was the activity he engaged in during the financial year ended 30 June 2004, and in earlier years, for the purpose of profit: cf Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at [54] ( Murry ).

28 The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other.

31 The cases referred to by senior counsel for the Commissioner about the nature of a business also do not support the contrast sought to be drawn. Murry at 604; Hope at 8-9; and Ferguson at 311 all describe in generally consistent terms what is involved in carrying on a business. They do not suggest that the activities undertaken in doing so, so that they may be called "business activities" are somehow outside or distinct from the business itself.

41 Whether particular payments in a particular year of income under an income protection policy are income from the business activity will depend upon the particular facts. In Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1996) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ), the benefits received by a holding company of an employer taken out on the life of an employee of a subsidiary company were part of its assessable income. The Court (Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ) said at 663:
 
 ... in general, insurance moneys are to be considered as received on revenue account where the purpose of the insurance was to fill the place of a revenue receipt which the event insured against has prevented from arising, or of any outgoing which has been incurred on revenue account in consequence of the event insured against, whether as a legal liability or as a gratuitous payment actuated only by considerations of morality or expediency.
 

The fact that it was the holding company which took out the policy and received the benefits, rather than the subsidiary employing company, did not alter that position. As that passage indicates, the purpose of the taxpayer entering into the contract of insurance which produced the payment is relevant to identifying the relationship of the payment with the business. See e.g. Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199 at 217; cf Murry at 626 [54].</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Eskandari [2004] FCA 8 ; (2004) 134 FCR 569</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/8.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In my opinion, the extrinsic materials do not indicate an intention to distinguish between those two expressions. They are discussed by Stone J in Commissioner of Taxation v Eskandari [2004] FCA 8 ; (2004) 134 FCR 569 ( Eskandari ) at [14]-[17]. I respectfully adopt her Honour's observations. I shall not repeat them in these reasons. The relevant legislative intention which appears to have underpinned Div 35 was to distinguish between "activities which are essentially private or lifestyle choices" and those which involve "genuine business activities" (see para 228 of "Review of Business Taxation a Tax System Redesigned", 1999). I also note, by way of illustration, that para 1.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Integrity Measures) Bill 2000 (Cth) by which Div 35 came to be in the ITAA 1997 says:
 
 Division 35 does not change the existing income tax concept of what constitutes the carrying on of a business. The Division will apply within that environment to those individuals able to claim business deductions under the existing law on the grounds that they are carrying on a business and meet all existing tests of deductibility.

30 Paragraph 1.15, when comparing the key features of the proposed law and the current law, says that the change is to provide that the excess of deductions over assessable income from a business may be claimed against other income only if one of the tests is satisfied or the Commissioner exercises a discretion to permit it.

35 Eskandari is the only decision concerning Div 35 of Pt 2 - 5 of Ch 2 of the ITAA 1997 to which my attention was drawn. The taxpayer sought to set-off against his normal salary the losses incurred in his unrelated business activity as a registered migration agent. It was common ground that, unless he could bring himself within the exception to the application of s 35 - 10 provided by s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i), s 35 - 10 would prevent him from setting off those losses. Section 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) permitted the Commissioner to decide that the rule in s 35 - 10 does not apply to a business activity for a year or years of income if satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply it because the business activity, in respect of the relevant income years, "because of its nature" would not satisfy one of the other tests imposed. Hence, the relevant issue was a narrow one: could s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) apply because of the nature of the business, namely that it was in its start-up phase and the anticipated revenue stream would not come about for some two years or more. The taxpayer claimed that his new business had that nature because he charged only a modest initial fee, and then incurred significant expense, and would only receive the substantial part of his fee when the visa application was granted, possibly some years later. Stone J decided that the term "because of its nature" referred to an inherent feature of the taxpayer's business activity in common with business activities of that type. Unless the "lead time" before a substantial success fee became payable was a common or inherent feature of migration agent businesses, rather than a consequence of how the taxpayer chose to charge, the exception in s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) could not apply and the Commissioner would not have a discretion to exercise.

36 Counsel for Mr Watson, at the other end of the spectrum of submissions, contended that there should be symmetry between the concepts of "taxable income" and "allowable deductions", in particular those deductions falling within the second limb of the income nexus test specified in s 8 - 1 (1)(b) of the ITAA 1997. If the premiums paid on the PIP policy were accepted as deductions by the Commissioner (as they apparently were), on the basis that they were necessarily incurred in carrying on the financial planning business, then payments made under the PIP policy should also be regarded as income received in carrying on the business.</text>

<text>28 The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other.

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/10.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The PIP partial disability payments received by Mr Watson for the year ended 30 June 2004 are clearly part of his assessable income: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578. That is common ground. So too is the nature of Mr Watson's business activity during that year. It was that of a financial planner, although (as he says) that required administration and regulation compliance activities, each of which did not directly result in the earning of income. That was the activity he engaged in during the financial year ended 30 June 2004, and in earlier years, for the purpose of profit: cf Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at [54] ( Murry ).

37 Whilst that contention has a superficial attraction, I think it over-simplifies the position. The PIP policy was clearly to diminish the adverse consequences of illness or accident. The benefits under the PIP policy provided protection against income loss from the inability to fully conduct the business, and so to earn income from it. So the benefits under the PIP policy are a partial indemnity for, and as a substitute for, the reduced commission and fee income which Mr Watson suffered by reason of his illness. There is no need for a direct monetary correlation between the amount of the benefits and the foregone or lost commission and fee income: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578 at 583. That does not, however, mean that the benefits under the PIP policy are part of assessable income from the business activity for the year in issue.

38 One submission of Mr Watson acknowledged that. He accepted it was necessary to take the extra step of regarding the business activity as encompassing the "related or incidental activities" which, in turn, include his "insurance activities".

39 Counsel for Mr Watson then submitted that the business activity of Mr Watson included his "insurance activities" as well as the range of other incidental administrative and professional matters referred to in [12] above. Counsel further submitted that the "insurance activities", by which he relevantly meant Mr Watson taking out the PIP policy and regularly paying the premiums on it and in the event of an insured risk occurring receiving the benefit of it, had the "significant commercial purpose" of securing a stream of income as a substitute for the business income that could be at risk if Mr Watson were injured or became ill. He also said there was a purpose of profit or the prospect of profit, because the potential benefits if an insured event occurred could be up to 75% of Mr Watson's earnings from the business and were much greater than the premiums payable from time to time. Counsel also relied upon the fact that, as the material showed, the PIP policy was taken out by many authorised representatives of National Mutual/AXA and by many other self-employed persons.</text>

<text>41 Whether particular payments in a particular year of income under an income protection policy are income from the business activity will depend upon the particular facts. In Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1996) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ), the benefits received by a holding company of an employer taken out on the life of an employee of a subsidiary company were part of its assessable income. The Court (Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ) said at 663:
 
 ... in general, insurance moneys are to be considered as received on revenue account where the purpose of the insurance was to fill the place of a revenue receipt which the event insured against has prevented from arising, or of any outgoing which has been incurred on revenue account in consequence of the event insured against, whether as a legal liability or as a gratuitous payment actuated only by considerations of morality or expediency.
 

The fact that it was the holding company which took out the policy and received the benefits, rather than the subsidiary employing company, did not alter that position. As that passage indicates, the purpose of the taxpayer entering into the contract of insurance which produced the payment is relevant to identifying the relationship of the payment with the business. See e.g. Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199 at 217; cf Murry at 626 [54].

46 To draw that line is not to exclude from the business, or the business activities, related or incidental activities. There may be a range of income sources which qualify as assessable income from a business or from business activities even though they are in a sense incidental to its main activities. In Kidston Goldmines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 77 , the Court held that the investment of surplus funds from sales of gold on the short-term money market was an incident of the taxpayer's goldmining business. That case also decided that the interest received was not, however, exempt from income tax under the then s 23(o) of the ITAA 1936 as it was not income "derived from the working of a mining property". It was not sufficiently proximate to the activities which directly generated income by gold mining. The result turned on the particular statutory provision. Other illustrations are provided by Carapark ; Lees &amp; Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 136 ( Lees &amp; Leech ); Warner Music Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 197 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [1952] HCA 65 ; (1952) 86 CLR 540 and G.P. International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1989) 170 CLR 124. To draw that line requires an assessment of the material circumstances at the relevant time or for the relevant period.

49 The relevant distinction which is drawn by s 35 is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year. Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it. Beaumont J (with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed) in BHP Petroleum at 170-171 applied the normal sense of a starting point, source or origin. Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received. As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech . In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy. I do not need to decide that question.</text>

Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received. As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech . In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy. I do not need to decide that question.</text>

<text>46 To draw that line is not to exclude from the business, or the business activities, related or incidental activities. There may be a range of income sources which qualify as assessable income from a business or from business activities even though they are in a sense incidental to its main activities. In Kidston Goldmines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 77 , the Court held that the investment of surplus funds from sales of gold on the short-term money market was an incident of the taxpayer's goldmining business. That case also decided that the interest received was not, however, exempt from income tax under the then s 23(o) of the ITAA 1936 as it was not income "derived from the working of a mining property". It was not sufficiently proximate to the activities which directly generated income by gold mining. The result turned on the particular statutory provision. Other illustrations are provided by Carapark ; Lees &amp; Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 136 ( Lees &amp; Leech ); Warner Music Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 197 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [1952] HCA 65 ; (1952) 86 CLR 540 and G.P.

<tocase>Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94</tocase>
<text>62 There is an undated note taken by Mr Watson of a discussion with an officer of the insurer:
 
 Therefore, there is a requirement to work if capable. If the insured person returns to work at a reduced capacity, the income protection is replacement income (business related income). If expenses exceed other business income (ie ignoring the Income Protection benefit itself) then to sell off the business is against the intent of the insurance act and the insurance company would cease benefit until other work was obtained.
 

In a practical sense, Mr Watson should take reasonable steps to "mitigate his loss". That obligation is one applicable to the measure of damages in all contracts. It does not apply as a term of the policy. Section 13 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) implies a term that each party to an insurance contract will act towards the other party with the utmost good faith. It could be expected that Mr Watson should therefore act reasonably in relation to the business activities or employment which he chooses to undertake: Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94. The element of reasonableness is also explained in cases such as Fidelity and Casualty Co of New York v Mitchell [1917] AC 592 ; Pocock v Century Insurance Co Ltd [1960] 2 Ll Rep 150; and Sergent v GRE (UK) Ltd [2000] Ll Rep 1R 77. That obligation extends to an insurer in determining whether an insured was totally and permanently disabled: see Beverley v Tyndall Life Insurance Co Ltd (1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-453. Reference may also be made to regs 17 and 18 of the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985 (Cth) and to the decision in QBE Insurance Ltd v Jande (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cas 61-270. Ultimately, the wording of the policy is the critical element.</text>
