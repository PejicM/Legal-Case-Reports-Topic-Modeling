<text>22 The applicants submit however that the "context otherwise requires" that the term "Leased Premises", when used in the option provision in special cl 11(2) of the Schedule, should not be given its defined meaning if that meaning is construed to refer to part only of the Land. Such a construction, it submits, would impute to the parties the absurd and commercially unreasonable intention of recording the grant of a void option. They point to the traditional doctrine that courts should be astute to adopt a construction that will preserve the validity of the contract: Meehan v Jones [1982] HCA 52 ; (1982) 149 CLR 571 at 589, and to prefer a construction which will encourage performance rather than avoidance of contractual relations: Ankar Pty Ltd &amp; Arnick Holdings Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 556-557; Westminster Properties Pty Ltd v Comco Constructions Pty Ltd (1991) 5 WAR 191 at 202. The Contract to Lease and the Lease each created a valid demise in that a demise of part of the Land for less than 20 years did not contravene the subdivision provisions of the Planning Act : s 136(1)(a). However the option to purchase would contravene s 136(1)(d) of the Planning Act and hence would be void, if it is construed as referrable to a purchase of part only of the Land. The proper construction, in that context, the applicants submit, is that the option is in respect of the whole of the Land.</text>

<text>24 The process of construction normally requires a consideration of not only the text and context of the written agreement, but also the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, as well as the purpose and object of the transaction: Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179, [40] ; Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at 461-2. The "history" of a contract is part of the context in which a contract takes its meaning: International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 242 ALR 47 at [8] . Even where there is no linguistic ambiguity extrinsic evidence may be considered in aid of construction: Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1 , particularly at 49-53. Ambiguity is not confined to a competition between two meanings. It extends to meanings which, for example, are doubtful, uncertain, or indistinct and which therefore require a consideration not only of text but also context: Colby Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2008) 165 FCR 133 at [42]-[43]. It may also be admitted to identify the subject matter of a contract, its nature and scope: Codelfa Constructions Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 349. The meaning arrived at in this way may not be the most obvious or most grammatically correct: Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australian Performing Right Association Limited [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109. Words may generally be supplied, omitted, or corrected in an instrument, where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency: Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 at 426-427 and 437.</text>

<text>6 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; 
 
 
 
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] .

31 I do not think that it can be said that the applicants have no reasonable prospects of success of demonstrating that the proper construction of the option in the Lease is as they contend, aided by a consideration of the above extrinsic circumstances. There are real issues of fact and law to be determined. The rights of the parties depend upon their resolution. In these circumstances it is appropriate that the matter should go to trial: Hicks v Ruddock at [13].

32 Harbeth contends that there is no evidence to support the pleas that Mr Healey was its agent to prepare and negotiate with potential purchasers the terms of the documents, to effect the sale of the business and the lease including the option. The second and third respondents submit that neither of them were agents to effect the commercial relations between Dandaven and Harbeth. This, they say, was the function of Performance Business Brokers. Mr Pannekoek, in his affidavit sworn on 21 December 2007 at [6] said that, in January 2006 he arranged for the Signs Business to be advertised for sale through Russell Lyon of Performance Business Brokers and that subsequently he instructed Mr Healey to assist. He did not explain what assistance it was that Mr Healey was to render. He said that Mr Healey provided accounting services to Harbeth and related entities as a consultant to PA (2004) Pty Ltd, the third respondent. In his affidavit sworn 10 March 2008 at [6.2] Mr Pannekoek said that PA (2004) acted as Harbeth's settlement agent.

33 The emails of 13 February 2006 from Mr Healey to each of Mr Reynolds and Mr Pannekoek concerned the Contract to Lease. The contents of each, in my opinion, arguably, is evidence that he, or by implication PA (2004), to which he consulted, acted as agent for Harbeth in relation, at least, to the Contract to Lease as pleaded by the applicants. Arguably, any such agency may extend to the formation of the Lease including the option. The Contract to Lease was inextricably tied up with the Lease and both were interrelated with the agreement for the sale of the business. Accordingly there are questions of fact and law as to the allegations of agency, which will require further exploration at trial. This is sufficient to overcome the dismissal application on this ground.</text>

<text>5 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] .

6 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; 
 
 
 
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

30 The respondents contend however that, whatever be the position in relation to the Contract to Lease, none of this extrinsic material is even arguably relevant to the construction of the option in the Lease itself which they say is clear in its terms and was drawn by the applicants' solicitors. I do not consider that this necessarily follows. The context, background or history to the Contract to Lease may arguably, in my view, also be relevant to a consideration of what is intended by the option in the Lease. The Contract for Lease, as I observed earlier, by clause 23 contemplated that any Lease would contain the terms of the offer in the Contract to Lease. Both are inter-related in this sense. There was no evidence as to what instructions were given by the applicants to their solicitors for the preparation of the Lease. It is reasonable to infer however that they were provided with the Contract to Lease: Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [132] per Gordon J. It is hardly surprising then that any ambiguity, absurdity or shortcoming in the Contract to Lease, could be repeated in the Lease. Additionally, in respect to the Lease, relevant extrinsic evidence would arguably also include a consideration of the conversations which, on the applicants' case, took place on 3 April 2006, concerning payment of rates and taxes as well as the content of the settlement statements sent to Mr Reynolds on 3 and 4 April 2006.</text>

<text>22 The applicants submit however that the "context otherwise requires" that the term "Leased Premises", when used in the option provision in special cl 11(2) of the Schedule, should not be given its defined meaning if that meaning is construed to refer to part only of the Land. Such a construction, it submits, would impute to the parties the absurd and commercially unreasonable intention of recording the grant of a void option. They point to the traditional doctrine that courts should be astute to adopt a construction that will preserve the validity of the contract: Meehan v Jones [1982] HCA 52 ; (1982) 149 CLR 571 at 589, and to prefer a construction which will encourage performance rather than avoidance of contractual relations: Ankar Pty Ltd &amp; Arnick Holdings Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 556-557; Westminster Properties Pty Ltd v Comco Constructions Pty Ltd (1991) 5 WAR 191 at 202. The Contract to Lease and the Lease each created a valid demise in that a demise of part of the Land for less than 20 years did not contravene the subdivision provisions of the Planning Act : s 136(1)(a). However the option to purchase would contravene s 136(1)(d) of the Planning Act and hence would be void, if it is construed as referrable to a purchase of part only of the Land. The proper construction, in that context, the applicants submit, is that the option is in respect of the whole of the Land.</text>
