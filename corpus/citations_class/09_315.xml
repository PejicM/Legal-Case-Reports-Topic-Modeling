<tocase>Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/4.html</AustLII>
<text>In Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 (" Applicant A "), a husband and wife, who were nationals of China, arrived in Australia and shortly thereafter the wife gave birth to a son. They claimed refugee status by virtue of the fact that they were the parents of one child and did not accept China's one child policy, which included, if necessary, enforcement by sterilisation. They claimed that they had a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to China. By a majority of 3:2, the High Court decided that they were not entitled to refugee status. Dawson J said that a particular social group for the purposes of the definition of refugee could not be defined by the persecution the members of the group feared. His Honour considered the meaning of the term "particular social group" and said (at 241): 
 "A particular social group, therefore, is a collection of persons who share a certain characteristic or element which unites them and enables them to be set apart from society at large. That is to say, not only must such persons exhibit some common element; the element must unite them, making those who share it a cognisable group within their society."
 (Citation omitted.) 

His Honour considered the relationship between the concept of a particular social group and a policy applied generally and said (at 243):
 
 "Rather, the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally. The persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that, by their actions, they have brought themselves within its terms. The only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy. For the reasons I have given, that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention." 

 
McHugh J discussed the concept of persecution and the circumstances in which conduct or action under a general law or a law of general application may constitute persecution. His Honour said (at 258-259):
 
 "Conduct will not constitute persecution, however, if it is appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate object of the country of the refugee. A legitimate object will ordinarily be an object whose pursuit is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens. The enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution. Nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory even though the laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality or social group. Thus, a law providing for the detention of the members of a particular race engaged in a civil war may not amount to persecution even though that law affects only members of that race. 

 
 However, where a racial, religious, national group or the holder of a particular political opinion is the subject of sanctions that do not apply generally in the State, it is more likely than not that the application of the sanction is discriminatory and persecutory. It is therefore inherently suspect and requires close scrutiny. In cases coming within the categories of race, religion and nationality, decision-makers should ordinarily have little difficulty in determining whether a sanction constitutes persecution of persons in the relevant category. Only in exceptional cases is it likely that a sanction aimed at persons for reasons of race, religion or nationality will be an appropriate means for achieving a legitimate government object and not amount to persecution." 

 (Citations omitted.)
 
 His Honour made the point (at 264) that, although persecutory conduct cannot define a social group, conduct of the persecutors may over time (perhaps over a short period of time) create a particular social group.
 
Gummow J's reasons were to the same effect as those of McHugh J. His Honour said (at 286):
 
 "With McHugh J, I conclude that the RRT made a finding that the relevant group comprised 'those who, having only one child, either do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised'. As to those who are so coerced or forced, the RRT erred in law by defining membership of the group by reference to acts giving rise to the well-founded fear of persecution. As to those persons having one child who 'do not accept the limitations placed upon them', they were, at best, merely a group for demographic purposes."

In Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293 (" Chen "), the High Court held that an applicant born in breach of China's one child policy who contended that he was a member of a social group called "black children", and who contended that he would suffer legal, social and economic disadvantages if returned to China, could form part of a particular social group for the purposes of the definition of a refugee. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ delivered joint reasons ("joint reasons") and their Honours made the point (at 301 [19]) that the fact that there is said to be a law of general application is more directly relevant to the question of persecution than to the question whether a person is a member of a particular social group. As to the latter question, their Honours said in the joint reasons: 
 "The question whether 'black children' can constitute a social group for the purposes of the Convention arises in a context quite different from that involved in Applicant A . That case was concerned with persons who feared the imposition of sanctions upon them in the event that they contravened China's 'one-child policy'. In this case, the question is whether children, who did not contravene that policy but were born in contravention of it, can constitute a group of that kind. To put the matter in that way indicates that the group constituted by children born in those circumstances is defined other than by reference to the discriminatory treatment or persecution that they fear. And so much was recognised by the Tribunal in its finding that a 'child is a "black child" irrespective of what persecution may or may not befall him or her'."

In Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 (" Applicant S "), the High Court held that a young Afghan man who had a well-founded fear of being forcibly conscripted to fight for the Taliban could fall within the definition of a refugee. It was not necessary that society perceive young able-bodied men as comprising a particular social group in order to conclude that they were a particular social group within the definition of a refugee. It is sufficient if they are cognisable within the community as a particular social group. Such conclusions are clearly objective, although, that is not to say that subjective perceptions within the community may not be relevant. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 400-401 [36]): 
 "Therefore, the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of 'particular social group' in Art 1A(2) of the Convention can be summarised as follows. First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large. Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a 'social group' and not a 'particular social group'. As this Court has repeatedly emphasised, identifying accurately the 'particular social group' alleged is vital for the accurate application of the applicable law to the case in hand." 

 (Citations omitted.)
 
The Court rejected a submission that there can only be persecution if enmity or malignity is present (at 401 [38]). The Court also addressed a submission that there was no persecution where the foreseeable risk of harm arose from the application of a law of general application. Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 402-403 [42]-[44]):
 
 "A law of general application is capable of being implemented or enforced in a discriminatory manner. 

 
 The criteria for the determination of whether a law or policy that results in discriminatory treatment actually amounts to persecution were articulated by McHugh J in Applicant A . His Honour said that the question of whether the discriminatory treatment of persons of a particular race, religion, nationality or political persuasion or who are members of a particular social group constitutes persecution for that reason ultimately depends on whether that treatment is 'appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate object of the country [concerned]'. These criteria were accepted in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Chen . As a matter of law to be applied in Australia, they are to be taken as settled. This is what underlay the Court's decision in Israelian . Namely, that enforcement of the law of general application in that particular case was appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate national objective. 

 
 In Applicant A , McHugh J went on to say that a legitimate object will ordinarily be an object the pursuit of which is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens. His Honour gave the examples that (i) enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution; and (ii) nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory. Whilst the implementation of these laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality, or social group, the legitimacy of the objects, and the apparent proportionality of the means employed to achieve those objects, are such that the implementation of these laws is not persecutory. 

 (Citations omitted.)

Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group. The relevant part of the definition of refugee consists of a number of elements and, although they each form part of a compound conception (see Applicant A at 242 per Dawson J; at 256 per McHugh J; Chen at 299 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), failure to comply with one is sufficient to defeat the claim. If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Israelian [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 354-355 [93] - [97] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

 (Citations omitted.)

The Court concluded that, by the application of the correct principles, the Tribunal correctly would have concluded the Taliban was not pursuing a "legitimate national objective" spoken of in Chen because, by international standards, the Taliban was a ruthless and despotic political body, founded on extremist religious tenets, and this affected the legitimacy of the object of protecting the nation. In any event, even if the object was a legitimate national objective, it was not appropriate and adapted (in the sense of being proportionate) in the means used to achieve that objective because the policy of conscription was implemented in a random and arbitrary manner (see at 404 [47]-[49]).

As far as the question of whether the parents' claim was foreclosed by a finding that any harm resulted from no more than the application of laws of general application, his Honour referred to evidence that the one child laws did operate or impact in a discriminatory way on certain groups, and that, on a remitter, the Tribunal would be required to consider whether there was a real chance of that occurring in relation to the applicant parents. Independently of that point, the Tribunal would be required to consider whether China's general family planning laws were appropriately adapted to meet the varying situations of parents who have more than one child. After quoting a passage from the reasons of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Applicant S , Merkel J said (at 347 [41]): 
 "The RRT did not enquire whether the harm feared by the applicant parents was appropriate and adapted to achieving the legitimate object of population control. That issue is to be determined by reference to 'the standards of civil societies which seek to meet the calls of common humanity': see Chen at CLR 303; ALR 560 ; ALD 328 [29]. As was explained in Chen , visiting the 'sins' (if they be that) of the parents on the child can be persecutory of the child. Similarly, there are many instances where the view may be taken that the birth of a second child may not have come about as a result of any 'sin' on the part of the mother. The birth of twins, or a child born as a result of a rape, or even failed contraception, are examples. A law of general application mandating the imposition of severe penalties on the mother irrespective of her personal circumstances may be regarded as a measure that, according to the standards of civil societies, is not appropriately adapted to achieving a legitimate object."

In the ordinary case, the Tribunal must consider the applicant's case by reference to the particular social group articulated by him or her.

The Tribunal had failed to decide the first question; it, in fact, had decided another question. Accordingly, it had failed to exercise jurisdiction. 
(See also at 1101; 407 [89] per Kirby J; at 1102; 408 [95] per Hayne J; Gleeson CJ dissented, but on the ground that, in fact, the Tribunal had not misunderstood the applicant's case.)

Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group. The relevant part of the definition of refugee consists of a number of elements and, although they each form part of a compound conception (see Applicant A at 242 per Dawson J; at 256 per McHugh J; Chen at 299 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), failure to comply with one is sufficient to defeat the claim. If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Israelian [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 354-355 [93] - [97] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>Where an applicant claims a well-founded fear of persecution because of membership of a particular social group then, in the ordinary case, the first question is whether the alleged group is a particular social group within the definition. That question involves, at least in part, a question of law. The next question is one of fact and it is whether the applicant is a member of the group. The questions thereafter are whether the applicant has a fear of persecution, whether that fear is well-founded and whether it is for a Convention reason (see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 ; 197 ALR 389 (" Dranichnikov ") at 1092; 394 [26] per Gummow and Callinan JJ (with whom Hayne J agreed)).

Particular problems have arisen in cases where the applicant claims that he or she is a member of a particular social group and fears serious harm, but the claim is made that there is no pre-existing social group and that the serious harm claimed arises from the application of a law of general application.

I was taken in some detail to three decisions of the High Court and one decision of a single judge of this Court, and it is to those decisions that I now turn.

In Dranichnikov , the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group, being Russian businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crimes or criminals. The appellant submitted that the Tribunal erred because it failed to consider his claim to refugee status by reference to that particular social group and only considered it by reference to the group of Russian businessmen. The appellant sought from the High Court special leave to appeal and relief under s 75(v) of the Constitution . The Court granted leave and relief under s 75(v). Gummow and Callinan JJ (with whom Hayne J agreed) considered that a failure by the Tribunal to respond to a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts was a failure to accord natural justice to the appellant (which was not a statutory ground of judicial review by reason of the then provisions of the Migration Act ) and was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. 
As cited above, their Honours said (at 1092; 394 [26]):
 
 "At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the Tribunal involves a number of steps. First the Tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."

These criteria were accepted in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Chen . As a matter of law to be applied in Australia, they are to be taken as settled. This is what underlay the Court's decision in Israelian . Namely, that enforcement of the law of general application in that particular case was appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate national objective. 

 
 In Applicant A , McHugh J went on to say that a legitimate object will ordinarily be an object the pursuit of which is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens. His Honour gave the examples that (i) enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution; and (ii) nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory. Whilst the implementation of these laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality, or social group, the legitimacy of the objects, and the apparent proportionality of the means employed to achieve those objects, are such that the implementation of these laws is not persecutory.

Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group. The relevant part of the definition of refugee consists of a number of elements and, although they each form part of a compound conception (see Applicant A at 242 per Dawson J; at 256 per McHugh J; Chen at 299 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), failure to comply with one is sufficient to defeat the claim. If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Israelian [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 354-355 [93] - [97] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

<text>The Full Court of this Court has held that a similar result may follow where the Tribunal fails to consider a claim put forward in the material before the Tribunal, even though the claim is not expressly articulated in the oral submissions and evidence at the hearing: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at 248 [13] - [14] per Merkel J; at 259 [41]-[42] per Allsop J; at 245 [1] per Spender J.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/30.html</AustLII>
<text>In SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 (" SFGB "), the Full Court of this Court suggested that an error consisting of the making of a finding of fact for which there is no evidence may well constitute a jurisdictional error, even if it cannot also be concluded that the decision-maker applied an incorrect test or failed to apply the correct test or took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations. The Court said (at 407 [19]-[20]): 
 "This argument, if it were made out, would be sufficient to establish that the tribunal had made a 'jurisdictional error' so as to found jurisdiction in this court to intervene. If the tribunal makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355 7 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 94 ALR 11 at 37 8 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 21 ALD 1 at 23 4. If the decision of the tribunal was ' Wednesbury ' unreasonableness or if the material on which the tribunal relied was so inadequate that the only inference was that the tribunal applied the wrong test or was not, in reality, satisfied in respect of the correct test, then there would also be jurisdictional error: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 62, 67, 76, 90 91 [2003] HCA 30 ; ; 73 ALD 1 at 4, 8 9, 18, 31 3. ( S20 ). 

 
 On the other hand, if there is sufficient evidence or other information before the tribunal on which it could reach the conclusion it did then it is for the tribunal to determine what weight it gives to that evidence. Indeed, unless the relevant fact can be identified as a "jurisdictional fact", there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35 6; 93 ALR 1 at 24 5."

The first respondent submitted that the principle identified in [53] above is inconsistent with the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 ; 198 ALR 59.

I have examined that decision carefully and I do not think there is anything in the decision which is inconsistent with the principle identified by the Full Court. Leaving aside the question of whether, sitting as a single judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, I could or should decline to follow a decision of the Full Court, I am not persuaded that the decision is clearly wrong and I think I should follow the principle identified by the Full Court. Issues on the appeal

In this case, the appellant through her solicitors made a written submission to the Tribunal that she is a member of a particular group of people, namely, Chinese parents of black children and that the punishments she has suffered and might suffer are not appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate end. The appellant submitted that her breach of the one child policy had not come about as the result of any "sin" on her part, bearing in mind the pressures imposed by Chinese society to bear a male child. She submitted that she suffers and continues to suffer serious psychological harm as a result of the persecution of her black child.

In this case, the Tribunal did not approach the matter by determining whether there was a particular social group of the type identified by the appellant, or, indeed, any other particular social group which might be reasonably arguable on the facts. The Tribunal approached the matter by considering whether the serious harm which the appellant feared, and which the Tribunal found, arose, or resulted from, the application of a law of general application. As I have said (at [50]), that is not necessarily an error.

However, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal made an error in determining that an order requiring a sterilisation operation arose, or resulted from, the application of a law of general application. That submission is correct.

I accept the first respondent's submission that there are limitations on the Tribunal's ability to determine with precision the provisions of China's family planning laws and that there would be a temptation to think, as the order that the appellant undergo a sterilisation operation followed "hard on the heels" of the termination of the appellant's third pregnancy, therefore it was part of a law of general application. However, when regard is had to the evidence the Tribunal referred to in relation to this question, it seems to me that there was no evidence that sterilisation was part of a law of general application. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary.

In determining the parameters of China's population policy, the Tribunal relied on evidence from various sources. It referred to the one child policy launched by the Chinese Government in 1979. It referred to the fact that there is no national legislation, and family planning policy is left to provinces and municipalities to implement, and each province has drafted its own regulations in support of the policy. The Tribunal noted sources indicating that family planning policy varied widely across China and that penalties for contravening the one child policy can also vary across regions. The Tribunal noted a source suggesting that, in general, Fujian had one of the least coercive family planning regimes in China and that "some local governments enforce family planning rules more vigorously than others". This has created "a patchwork of different rules and enforcement across the province". In dealing with coercive measures, the Tribunal referred to the following: 
(1) A statement by the United States of America Department of State in 1999;
 
(2) A Canadian report dated 2000;
 
(3) Reports prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2004;
 
(4) A news article, another Canadian report and other reports of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

These sources suggested that government policy forbade forced sterilisations, although they occurred from time to time. They tended to result from the actions of overzealous officials and they were becoming rarer.</text>

<tocase>SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 77 ALD 402</tocase>
<text>In SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 (" SFGB "), the Full Court of this Court suggested that an error consisting of the making of a finding of fact for which there is no evidence may well constitute a jurisdictional error, even if it cannot also be concluded that the decision-maker applied an incorrect test or failed to apply the correct test or took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations. The Court said (at 407 [19]-[20]): 
 "This argument, if it were made out, would be sufficient to establish that the tribunal had made a 'jurisdictional error' so as to found jurisdiction in this court to intervene. If the tribunal makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355 7 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 94 ALR 11 at 37 8 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 21 ALD 1 at 23 4. If the decision of the tribunal was ' Wednesbury ' unreasonableness or if the material on which the tribunal relied was so inadequate that the only inference was that the tribunal applied the wrong test or was not, in reality, satisfied in respect of the correct test, then there would also be jurisdictional error: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 62, 67, 76, 90 91 [2003] HCA 30 ; ; 73 ALD 1 at 4, 8 9, 18, 31 3. ( S20 ). 

 
 On the other hand, if there is sufficient evidence or other information before the tribunal on which it could reach the conclusion it did then it is for the tribunal to determine what weight it gives to that evidence. Indeed, unless the relevant fact can be identified as a "jurisdictional fact", there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35 6; 93 ALR 1 at 24 5."

It seems to me that the finding that sterilisation was part of a penalty for the contravention of a law of general application was in error and the error was that there was no evidence to support the finding. The error was an error of law and, following the Full Court's decision in SFGB , a jurisdictional error. The finding was a critical step in the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion.

It seems to me that it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that the appellant belonged to a particular social group, being those women who became pregnant in contravention of China's family planning laws and who have been required to have that pregnancy terminated. The Tribunal found the appellant had a well-founded fear of serious harm (that is, forced sterilisation) and it seems to me that it would be open to it to conclude that the harm was for reasons of her membership of the social group and not for the reason of the application of a law of general application. In those circumstances, the appeal must be allowed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal. Conclusion

The orders of the Court are as follows: 
1. The appeal be allowed.
 The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on 21 February 2008 be set aside and in lieu of those orders there be orders that: 
(a) a writ of certiorari issue quashing the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 26 October 2006 (RRT Case Number 060341569); and
 
(b) a writ of mandamus issue directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal requiring it to hear and determine the appellant's application for review according to law.</text>

<tocase>VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332</tocase>
<text>The appellant in the present case relied heavily on the decision of Merkel J in VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332 , and it is necessary to consider that decision. There were three applicants for protection visas in that case: a Chinese couple and their third child, who was born in Australia. The applicants claimed a well-founded fear of persecution as a result of the contravention of China's one child policy. The harm feared by the parents was forced sterilisation of the applicant mother, a substantial financial penalty which they could not pay and limitations on employment opportunities. In the case of the child, the fear was that, as a black child, he would face significant discrimination and disadvantage. For present purposes, it is necessary to discuss the reasons only in so far as they deal with the claim of the applicant parents. The Tribunal found that the parents were not members of a particular social group because the harm suffered or feared was the sole defining characteristic of the group. It found that the child was a member of a social group, but that he would not suffer persecution as a black child. It found that China's family planning laws were not discriminatory because they applied to all citizens equally, and are directed at a legitimate purpose, namely, limiting population growth. It further found that the financial burden on the parents was serious, but was not persecution within the Convention or s 91R of the Act.

Merkel J held that, as far as the parents' claim was concerned, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error. It had failed to consider the correct question in determining whether the parents were members of a particular social group. The correct test was (at 345 [32]): 
 "...whether, over time, the singling out of parents of 'black children' for discriminatory treatment under China's family planning laws might have been absorbed into the social consciousness of the community with the consequence that a combination of legal and social factors (or norms) prevalent in the community indicated that such parents form a social group distinguishable from the rest of the community: cf Applicant S at ALR 251; ALD 550 [31]."</text>
