<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250</tocase>
<text>I turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act . The relevant principles are now well settled: see, for example, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258 per Branson J; Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4 ) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at 465-6 [19] per Goldberg J; Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1325 at [6] - [7] per Weinberg J; Jarrama Pty Ltd v Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1114 at [10] per Crennan J; Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 5) (2004) 212 ALR 311 at 317-8 [37]-[42] per Sackville J; Crawford v Bank of Western Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 949 at [16] - [21] per Lee J; Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 at [18] per Young J; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) (2006) 236 ALR 322 at 332 [30] and [31] per Jessup J; and Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [17] [20] per Gordon J.

The Court must assess whether the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. In making this assessment, the Court may, and ordinarily will, take into account the amount offered to the group members, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the amount nominated in the settlement offer, the terms of any advice from counsel and any independent expert, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement: see Williams v FAI Home Security [2000] FCA 1925 ; 180 ALR 459 at [19] . The Court must also be satisfied that the settlement has been made in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not merely the interests of the first and second applicants and the respondent: see ACCC v Chats House 71 FCR at 258.</text>
