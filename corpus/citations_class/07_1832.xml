<tocase>Grovenor v Permanent Trustee Company of NSW Ltd (1966) 40 ALJR 329</tocase>
<text>68 In Grovenor v Permanent Trustee Company of NSW Limited (1966) 40 ALJR 329, also cited by McHugh J, the High Court stated (at 330) that "[t]he well-established rules as to the joinder of necessary parties ... ought always to be strictly observed".

69 By the amended originating process, Idameneo seeks, relevantly:
 
&#8226; a declaration that Symbion Health is not bound by the TID in so far as it contains cll 13.8 and 13.9; and
 
&#8226; an injunction restraining Symbion Health from paying, and the Directors from causing or procuring Symbion Health to pay, the break fee referred to in cll 13.8 and 13.9 of the TID.
 
A declaration that Symbion Health is not bound by the provision for payment of the Symbion Health Break Fee and an injunction directed against payment of it directly affect Symbion Health's contractual obligations of Symbion Health to Healthscope and Healthscope's contractual rights against Symbion Health.

70 It is not practicable to formulate the relief sought in respect of the Symbion Health Break Fee so that it will affect only the rights and interests of the parties to the proceeding and not those of Healthscope. Idameneo necessarily seeks relief that will affect the rights and interests of Healthscope too.</text>

<tocase>Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/37.html</AustLII>
<text>114 There is a well-known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors, not the courts, to identify where the interests of a company lie, and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors: see, for example, Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483 at 493; Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 (PC) at 832. Unlike a company's power to issue shares with which the cases just cited were concerned, the power to agree to the inclusion of a break fee provision in a complex contract of the TID kind, being sui generis , is even less apt to being circumscribed by any more detailed rules than the general duty expressed in s 181(1).</text>

<tocase>News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410</tocase>
<text>61 Symbion Health submits that Idameneo's failure to join Healthscope as a party is a fatal defect in the proceeding. Symbion Health cites News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 ( News v ARL ) at 524 525 and Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291 at [77] per McHugh J. Symbion Health submits that Healthscope's rights against Symbion will be directly affected if Idameneo obtains the relief it seeks, because Healthscope will lose the benefit of the Symbion Health Break Fee provision. Similarly, Healthscope's rights will, according to Symbion Health, also be directly affected by the relief relating to the proposed Capital Reduction, since the effect of the relief sought in that respect is that approval of the Capital Reduction by all ordinary shareholders of Symbion Health would be required, and Idameneo has made it clear that it will oppose the capital reduction. Thus, the Diagnostics Transaction will be doomed to fail.</text>

<tocase>Re AMP Ltd (2003) 48 ACSR 540</tocase>
<text>49 Finally, Symbion Health refers to the decision of Emmett J in Re AMP Ltd (2003) 48 ACSR 540 ( AMP ) in which his Honour appears to have had no difficulty in accepting that an equal reduction of capital was involved, even though cl 3.3 of the scheme before him was an "ineligible overseas shareholders" provision.

50 Idameneo points out that under cl 13.8 of the TID (summarised at [20] [22] above), the amount of the Symbion Health Break Fee and the Healthscope Break Fee (each $19.575 million) includes a reasonable amount of compensation in respect of costs and expenses incurred by Healthscope and Symbion Health respectively in respect of the Original Scheme. Idameneo submits that to the extent that the Symbion Health Break Fee includes compensation in respect of costs and expenses of that kind, the conduct of the Directors in causing Symbion Health to agree to pay that fee is a breach of their duties as directors either under s 181(1) of the Act or under the general law:
 
 
 (a) to act bona fide in the best interests of Symbion Health, and, or in the alternative, 
 
 
 (b) for a proper purpose.

51 Idameneo submits that Symbion Health's response to a notice given to it by Idameneo to produce documents in respect of the negotiation of the contents of clauses 4.9, 13.8 and 13.9 of the TID does not disclose that the Directors gave any consideration to the issue whether the break fee to be agreed to as payable by Symbion Health should include Healthscope's costs associated with the failed Original Scheme.

86 Similarly, in AMP 48 ACSR 540, an application for orders under s 411 of the Act in respect of a scheme of arrangement, Emmett J had no difficulty in recognising the distinction between a "Capital Adjustment Resolution" which gave rise to a "Cancellation Entitlement" in the Scheme Shareholders on the one hand, and the application of that Cancellation Entitlement by the Scheme company as consideration for the issue to the Scheme Shareholders of an appropriate number of shares in a different company. While there was no argument on the question, the reduction was recognised by his Honour as an equal reduction distinct from the logically subsequent application of the Cancellation Entitlement of each Scheme Shareholder (see [6] [8]). In that case a distinction was drawn in the Scheme conditions, appropriately in my view, between the Capital Adjustment Resolution which effected the reduction of share capital on the one hand, and "Scheme mechanics" that included both the application of the Cancellation Entitlement and the treatment of ineligible overseas shareholders on the other hand.

87 A second submission made by Symbion Health, outlined above at [43], is that, independently of the formal distinctness of the two resolutions, the proposed reduction is an equal reduction. The submission is that para (c) of s 256B(2) ("the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares") is to be construed in the light of the purpose of the provision. That purpose is stated in s 256A as being "to ensure fairness between a company's shareholders". Symbion Health refers to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Company Law Review Bill 1997 (Cth) which introduced s 256C. The Explanatory Memorandum explained (at 10.17):
 
 Selective reductions require a special resolution, or unanimous shareholder agreement at a general meeting, because they have the capacity to advantage some shareholders over others . Where a selective reduction is approved by a special resolution, a vote may not be cast in favour of the resolution by a person who is to receive consideration as part of the reduction, or whose liability in respect of amounts unpaid on shares is to be reduced. ... This is intended to ensure that the resolution's approval reflects the wishes of the company's disinterested shareholders and corresponds to the approach taken in section 257D of the Bill in relation to shareholder approval for a selective share buy-back.
 (Emphasis added.)

88 I also accept this alternative submission made by Symbion Health. I do not think that para (c) of s 256B(2) is concerned with characteristics peculiar to a particular shareholder (in this case the operation of the laws of the place of residence of a particular overseas shareholder) that have nothing to do with equality of treatment of shareholders by the resolution or by its operation on their rights under the constitution of the company. There is no suggestion that the Ineligible Overseas Shareholders provision has "the capacity to advantage some shareholders over others" in the relevant sense of "aptness to advantage some shareholders over others".

89 The law, whether Australian or foreign, may have a wide and diverse range of impacts on shareholders in an Australian company who reside overseas. Revenue laws come to mind. The effect of those laws may be that the ultimate net effect of a distribution will be different as between Australian resident shareholders and a particular overseas resident shareholder. A reduction of capital can be an equal reduction notwithstanding the operation of such laws on the special position of the overseas shareholders. Indeed, tax considerations may be seen to produce differential ultimate net effects of a capital reduction even as between particular Australian resident shareholders, but it could not be suggested that the reduction is made a selective one on that account.

90 The presently contemplated overseas laws preventing in specie distributions are also laws of general application that cause a procedural difficulty for overseas resident shareholders in realising their entitlements. I do not think that a procedure of the kind expressed in the Ineligible Overseas Shareholders Resolution is the concern of para (c) of s 256B(2): such a procedure is designed to facilitate equality of treatment of shareholders rather than to prevent it.</text>

<tocase>Re ETRADE Australia Limited (1999) 30 ACSR 516</tocase>
<text>48 Symbion Health also relies on the judgment of Santow J in Re ETRADE Australia Ltd (1999) 30 ACSR 516 ( ETRADE ). It refers to the statement by his Honour (at 517) to the effect that in that case a distinction was to be drawn between the reduction of capital by the allocation of cash pro rata according to a certain formula on the one hand, and the application of the shareholders' cash entitlement (by reason of a scheme of arrangement before his Honour) in the purchase of shares previously acquired by the scheme company.

84 In ETRADE 30 ACSR 516, Santow J distinguished between a resolution for the reduction of capital which provided for a distribution of cash to the shareholders, and a logically subsequent application of their cash entitlements to the acquisition of shares in another company. Under the scheme of arrangement that was before the court, the shareholders in a company were required to acquire shares in another company. His Honour said that such cases concerned the question of "the precise point at which the reduction of capital ceased its work and an associated scheme of arrangement took over" (at 516). He stated (at 517):
 
 The present proposal before me might be thought to involve a reduction of capital by way of transfer of shares owned by the company effecting the reduction. (There is also the usual provision for shareholders with foreign addresses having their pro rata allocation of shares allotted or transferred to a nominee for sale and the proceeds accounted for to the shareholder with the foreign address.) However, that characterisation would not be an accurate statement of what in fact is brought about by the reduction of capital. The reduction of capital in legal terms allocates cash pro rata according to the formula in the documentation. Only after that, and solely by force of the scheme, that cash is required to be applied in purchasing ICM shares previously acquired by the scheme company, ETRADE Australia Ltd. The two steps are telescoped, so that the shareholder never physically receives the cash, but they remain conceptually distinct.
 
 In those circumstances, there is clearly enough what s 256B(2) defines as an "equal reduction". That is to say, the reduction relates only to ordinary shares including those created by virtue of the exercise of pre-existing options, it applies in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held and the "the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares". Being thus an equal reduction, it may now be effected merely by an ordinary resolution.

85 Consistently with this passage, I regard the Capital Reduction as ending with the allocation of the pro rata number of Consideration Shares provided for in the Capital Reduction Resolution to each Symbion Health shareholder as at the Record Date. The Capital Reduction Resolution gives rise to an entitlement in each such shareholder to a certain number of the Consideration Shares, even if "the shareholder never physically receives" those Consideration Shares, to adopt the words of Santow J. The entitlement to a certain number of the Consideration Shares and the ultimate receipt of cash representing the proceeds of the sale of them "remain conceptually distinct" as his Honour said of the entitlement to cash and receipt of shares in ETRADE 30 ACSR 516.</text>

<text>61 Symbion Health submits that Idameneo's failure to join Healthscope as a party is a fatal defect in the proceeding. Symbion Health cites News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 ( News v ARL ) at 524 525 and Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291 at [77] per McHugh J. Symbion Health submits that Healthscope's rights against Symbion will be directly affected if Idameneo obtains the relief it seeks, because Healthscope will lose the benefit of the Symbion Health Break Fee provision. Similarly, Healthscope's rights will, according to Symbion Health, also be directly affected by the relief relating to the proposed Capital Reduction, since the effect of the relief sought in that respect is that approval of the Capital Reduction by all ordinary shareholders of Symbion Health would be required, and Idameneo has made it clear that it will oppose the capital reduction. Thus, the Diagnostics Transaction will be doomed to fail.

67 In Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; 195 CLR 291 McHugh J gave as a reason for setting aside orders of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, a want of necessary parties. His Honour stated (at [77]), citing, inter alia , News v ARL 64 FCR 410:
 
 The rules of natural justice require that, before a court makes an order that may affect the rights or interests of a person, that person should be given an opportunity to contest the making of that order. Because that is so, it is the invariable practice of the courts to require such a person to be joined as a party if there is an arguable possibility that he or she may be affected by the making of the order.</text>
