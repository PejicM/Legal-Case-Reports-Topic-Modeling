<text>It is important to remember that a right to interlocutory relief depends upon the moving party being able to establish that there is a right to final relief. I consider that if the meeting on 19 August 2009 was ineffective to remove Mr Stawiczny as Managing Director of the Company and from participation in the management of the Company and that the resolution to remove him as a director of the Company proposed to be put to the meeting of members of the Company on 10 September 2009 is not a resolution that can properly be put having regard to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, then those matters give rise to an entitlement to relief under s 233 of the Act: cf Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 218.

Mr Anderson gave notice of the meeting of directors on the morning of 18 August 2009. His notice stated that the meeting was being called for 8.00am on the following day and that "if a quorum is present at that time, the meeting will proceed whether or not you are there. This is consistent with the process as per our Company Constitution ". Later that day Mr Stawiczny sent an email to Mr Anderson in which he said that it was not convenient for him to meet at that time. The meeting did not occur at 8.00am on 19 August 2009 as Mr Stawiczny was not present.

It will be recalled that cl 4(c) of the Shareholders' Agreement provided that a quorum for meetings of directors was all directors. As I have noted earlier, what occurred on 19 August 2009 is controversial. There is no doubt that at some time after 11.00am-11.30am the three directors were present in the one room and that there was a dialogue about issues which particularly concerned Mr Anderson and Mr Dunford. Mr Anderson's evidence as to what occurred is disputed by Mr Stawiczny. I have referred earlier to the evidence of Mr Stawiczny and Mr Anderson.</text>
