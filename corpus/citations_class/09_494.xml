<tocase>Re Mingchi Lin v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 106 ALD 211, [2009] AATA 44</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2009/44.html</AustLII>
<text>On 31 March 2008, the applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) for a review of the delegate's decision. The Tribunal held a hearing on 31 October 2008. On 22 January 2009, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision. At the same time, the Tribunal delivered reasons in support of its decision ( Re Mingchi Lin v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 106 ALD 211, [2009] AATA 44 ( the Tribunal's reasons )).

The proceedings in this Court are brought pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ( the AAT Act ). The applicant has raised four questions of law for this Court's consideration. These questions are set out below under the heading The Questions of Law and the Grounds of Appeal .

This Court has wide powers when hearing and determining an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act. The Court may make such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision (s 44(4)). The Court may make findings of fact (s 44(7)) and may affirm or set aside the Tribunal's decision and remit the case to be heard and decided again in accordance with the directions of the Court (s 44(5)).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/61.html</AustLII>
<text>As Mason CJ said in Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) v Royal Insurance Australia Limited [1994] HCA 61 ; (1994) 182 CLR 51 at 64: 
 But, as the Court went on to point out in Ward v Williams , the question whether a public officer, to whom a power is given by facultative words, is bound to exercise that power upon any particular occasion, or in any particular manner, is to be solved from the context, from the particular provisions, or from the general scope and objects of the enactment conferring the power (see Ward v Williams [1955] HCA 4 ; (1955) 92 CLR 496 at 505).</text>

<text>The Court has to adopt a practical approach when considering whether or not relief should be granted as a result of its determination of questions of law pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act. In the present case, the approach taken by the Tribunal in grouping together shorter periods of time into calendar years or, as was the case in 2006 and 2007, into an 18 month period, did not distort or place a different complexion upon those matters which were advanced by the applicant as supporting his subs (4) claims. In my view, had the approach which I have held is the correct approach strictly been taken in the present case the ultimate conclusions reached by the Tribunal in respect of the applicant's subs (4) claims would not have been any different. Further, the only questions of law raised by the applicant are those which I have extracted at [24] above. The applicant did not raise any question or issue concerning the way in which the Tribunal approached the delineation of the periods which it considered might receive subs (4) treatment. To send the matter back to the Tribunal in those circumstances would be futile. The Court will not take that course if to do so would be futile (see Morales v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550 at 560 562; and Commissioner of Taxation v Eskandari [2004] FCA 8 ; (2004) 134 FCR 569 at [50] [54) (pp 583 584).</text>

<tocase>Corlette v Mackenzie (1995) 62 FCR 584</tocase>
<text>In the same case, Brennan J (at 84 85) and Dawson J (at 97 98) made statements to a similar effect. A number of the relevant authorities were also gathered together and discussed by Beazley J in Corlette v Mackenzie (1995) 62 FCR 584 at 589 593.

The Preamble to the new Act provides as follows: 
 Preamble 
 The Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity.
 The Parliament recognises that persons conferred Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations:
 (a) by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people; and
 (b) by sharing their democratic beliefs; and
 (c) by respecting their rights and liberties; and
 (d) by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.

Australian citizenship is a privilege. However, the Parliament is to be taken as wanting to encourage as many persons who are relevantly connected to Australia to take up what is described in the Preamble as: 
 ... full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia ...</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Roberts [1993] FCA 80 ; (1993) 41 FCR 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/80.html</AustLII>
<text>At [34] [39] of its reasons, the Tribunal considered the question of whether the activities undertaken by the applicant in the period from 5 May 2004 to 29 June 2007 were activities beneficial to the interests of Australia. At [35] of its reasons, the Tribunal referred to the decision of Einfeld J in Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Roberts [1993] FCA 80 ; (1993) 41 FCR 82 and then said: 
 Mr Lin has tried to demonstrate a mainly commercial stream of benefit although he has personal links to Australia as well through his children. I acknowledge that Mr Lin has taken steps towards benefiting Australia but he has not demonstrated that he spent much of his time on activities that benefit Australia while he was overseas during the 5 years before his application.

Counsel for the Minister also submitted that, for the elements of subitem (8)(4)(a) of Item 7 to be satisfied, there needs to be some objective benefit to some public interest of Australia and that this means more than the private interests of the applicant (see Re Tinamisan and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1996) 43 ALD 349 ; and Roberts [1993] FCA 80 ; 41 FCR 82). The Third and Fourth Questions of Law and Grounds 2 and 3

The phrase beneficial to Australia was explained by Einfeld J in Roberts [1993] FCA 80 ; (1993) 41 FCR 82 at 87 as follows: 
 It seems to me that the term "activities beneficial to the interests of Australia" means something in the nature of activities which provide some advantage to Australia, whether commercial or otherwise. The concept necessarily connotes some public interest of Australia, even if of a general or non-specific character, and means more than the private interests of the respondent. The section requires some objective benefit to Australia.

I agree with his Honour's observations. However, I wish to add some observations of my own. The advantage or benefit to Australia contemplated by the language of subs (4)(a) must be real and not merely potential or hypothetical. That advantage or benefit must be identifiable and not de minimis.

It must also be remembered that what is required by that subsection is that the Minister consider that the activities are beneficial to Australia. This imposes a requirement that the Minister act both honestly and rationally in forming the view which he or she is required to form. In my view, it is perfectly appropriate for the Minister to have regard to the ACI in considering whether or not the relevant activities are beneficial to Australia.

I will now turn to the questions of law raised in the appeal and the application of the above principles to the facts and circumstances of the present case. The Present Case and the Questions of Law Raised in the Appeal

The first question of law, as amplified by particular (a) to Ground 1, does not, in my view, arise in the present case.

I do not think that the Tribunal proceeded upon the basis that activities undertaken through and on behalf of a corporation could never qualify as activities engaged in by the citizenship applicant for the purpose of subs (4)(a) of the transitional s 22.

In its reasons, the Tribunal quoted extensively from the ACI. The ACI does not specifically refer to a dichotomy of the kind about which the applicant complains in this appeal and the general tenor of its language suggests that individuals may take the benefit of activities carried out by them (ie through their personal efforts) even though those activities were carried out during the course of their employment by a corporation. Further, at [26] of its reasons, the Tribunal expressly stated that it would regard the applicant's efforts in the business of Australian Mingsheng as activities which might count as activities of the relevant kind for the purposes of subpar (a) of subs (4) of the transitional s 22, should the remaining criteria prescribed by subs (4) be satisfied.

At [27] of its reasons, the Tribunal held that the relevant activities in 2004 had not been established as being beneficial to Australia with the consequence that the applicant could not take the benefit of them personally for the purposes of subs (4) of the transitional s 22. The rejection of the applicant's claims in this regard was not on the basis that the activities were for the benefit of the corporation (Australian Mingsheng) but rather on the basis that they had not been proven to be beneficial to Australia.

In respect of the later periods of time with which the Tribunal expressly dealt, the reasoning of the Tribunal manifested a similar approach.</text>

<tocase>Re Tinamisan and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1996) 43 ALD 349</tocase>
<text>The Tribunal then went on to consider the remaining activities in which the applicant was involved in the period 2005 2007 and, at [36] [39] of its reasons, said the following: The activities for Changsha Huiminshen Property Co Ltd, which resulted in a substantial involvement of Australians in a major project, are more in the nature of activities Mr Lin performed for this private entity in my view. He has not produced convincing evidence that he was personally responsible for or largely engaged in activity which brought about this result. Activities for an employer do not satisfy the requirements although an exception may be made in instances such as those for an entity wholly or substantially owned and controlled by an applicant: see Re Tinamisan and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1996) 43 ALD 349. Exports are not intrinsically beneficial to Australia although I have accepted that Mr Lin's significant exports in late 2006 onwards were beneficial: see Re McCarthy and Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1993] AATA 166 ; (1993) 30 ALD 447. Even if the contract with the Australian design company were taken as an export of services, the contract is with an entity in which Mr Lin plays only a part. Mr Lin's evidence about the time he spent on activities that involved his Australian business interests and development of business ties also did not create an impression that he spent the bulk of his time on these matters. He divides his time among his several business enterprises in China and Australia, and merely pressing his Australian contacts when talking to Chinese business interests is not sufficient to establish activities beneficial to Australia and which comprised a large proportion of his time. As I am not satisfied that Mr Lin engaged sufficiently in activities that were beneficial to Australia from mid 2002 for 2 years out of five or from mid 2005 for one year out of two, leading up to his application on 29 June 2007, Mr Lin has not met the residency requirements of subitem 7(8)(1) and (4) and cannot be granted citizenship on this basis. I have also considered whether Mr Lin is likely to reside, or to continue to reside in Australia or to maintain a close and continuing association with Australia if his application were to be approved. This is a requirement of subsection 21(2)(g). I am not convinced by the evidence before me, on balance, that Mr Lin is likely to increase his stays in Australia than previously, despite two of his children being Australian citizens. Mr Lin, in my view, is still heavily engaged in his various businesses in China and the tenor of his evidence was that his presence would be required there in connection with property developments in which he is involved. As Mr Lin has not spent the requisite time in Australia, being two years out of five and one year out of two preceding his application, and has not demonstrated that his activities during time spent overseas were beneficial to Australia, he cannot succeed in his present application. His absences overseas mean he does not satisfy the residence requirements of sections 21 and 22 of the new Act pursuant to subitems 7(2) and 7(8) of the Transitional Act. It may be that he will meet criteria eventually if he continues with and expands his activities which benefit Australia, however, as at the date of his application Mr Lin was not entitled to conferral of Australian citizenship.

The Tribunal then affirmed the delegate's decision.

At the commencement of the hearing before me, the applicant sought leave to amend his Notice of Appeal. There was no opposition by the respondent to the amendments sought. Accordingly, I granted leave to the applicant to amend his Notice of Appeal in the manner sought by him.

Counsel for the Minister also submitted that, for the elements of subitem (8)(4)(a) of Item 7 to be satisfied, there needs to be some objective benefit to some public interest of Australia and that this means more than the private interests of the applicant (see Re Tinamisan and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1996) 43 ALD 349 ; and Roberts [1993] FCA 80 ; 41 FCR 82).
