<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>

<text>18 The appellant did not argue this ground. Further, neither the Tribunal nor Scarlett FM considered the principles of non-refoulement for the reason that it had not been determined that the appellant satisfied the criterion for refugee status under the Act. Accordingly, this claim cannot succeed. If, by virtue of it, the appellant is seeking a review on the merits, this is not appropriate in judicial review. The role of the Court in an appeal such as this was stated succinctly by Mason J (as he then was) in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40- 41, where His Honour said:
 
 'The limited role of a Court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of a Court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: Wednesbury Corporation [41].'

19 Scarlett FM did not rely upon or refer to such authority in reaching his decision. Further there is no basis for such submission. The decision only becomes relevant in circumstances in which an appellant has nominated a migration agent or other adviser. This was not the case in these proceedings, and the decision in Makhu is irrelevant.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/142.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The Court observes that there is no statutory obligation upon the Tribunal to provide legal advice or to refer applicants to a migration service. Further, Scarlett FM noted that the appellant confirmed that she had sought and received advice from a solicitor on the Tribunal's Legal Advice Panel. The appellant retained Mr Deng as her legal and migration adviser, and is critical of the service she was provided in relation to her migration matters. However, misconduct on the part of a migration agent does not give rise to a reviewable error of law: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142.

25 In light of the extension of time granted to the appellant to enable her to prepare further written submissions, and the fact that she has had since at least 4 October 2006, the date on which she was informed of the hearing date of her appeal, to avail herself of legal advice, I do not consider a further extension of time or another hearing is warranted.

26 I can find no error in the decision of Scarlett FM or the Tribunal, and accordingly the appeal must be dismissed.</text>
