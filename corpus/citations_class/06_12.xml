<tocase>Hooper v Kirella [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1584.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Order 15A rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules provide respectively for what is colloquially known as "identity discovery" and "information discovery": see generally Hooper v Kirella [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1. I am empowered by our Rules to order identity discovery where (i) an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in this Court against that person; and (ii) it appears that some other person has, has had, or is likely to have knowledge of facts or possession of any document tending to assist in ascertaining who that person is.

4 Information discovery in contrast is discovery against the very person against whom relief may be sought. It is tightly circumscribed in the requirements to be met before discovery may be ordered. These are that:
 
 
 "(a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and 
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision."

5 Common to both species of discovery is a prospective proceeding which may be commenced in this Court. Inherent in this possibility are the requirements that the proceeding will be (a) within federal jurisdiction and (b) in respect of a cause of action known to law which is not purely speculative in character and which is not devoid of prospects. There is no difficulty in this matter in relation to the former of these requirements, some at least of the prospective causes of action being said to arise under Commonwealth legislation: see Judiciary Act 1903 , s 39B(1A)(c). It is the latter requirement, which requires the identification of a possible cause of action (in this case a legal wrong done to the applicants), that is problematic.

6 It is unnecessary for me to refer in detail to the growing body of case law on preliminary discovery. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the following. The O 15A r 3 power to order identity discovery is not to be used in favour of a person who intends to commence merely speculative proceedings. A material factor in the exercise of the Court's discretion is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in proceedings against the person wished to be sued: Hooper v Kirella at [33]. Information discovery under O 15A r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) of that rule. Subpar (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court. While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level: see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ; the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one: see Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Though it is not necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case, it is not enough merely to assert that there is, or is the mere possibility of, a case against the prospective respondent: Hooper v Kirella at [39]. Importantly, as Hely J observed in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26]:
 
 "(d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73]."

125 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the applicants have met the limiting conditions of O 15A r 6(a) for the purposes of information discovery in respect of the potential tort of misfeasance in public office. Equally I am not satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 identity discovery that the prospective proceedings intended to be commenced would be other than speculative: Hooper v Kirella , at [33]. Hence this form of discovery will not be ordered.

126 I will order that the application be dismissed.

<text>7 While O 15 r 6 expressly contemplates "fishing", it equally requires that each of the limiting conditions prescribed in subpars (a), (b) and (c) must be established. Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves: Airservices Australia Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 at [5] .

8 Before outlining the factual setting of this matter I should indicate that it has undergone a significant transformation since the hearing of the application. I gave the applicants leave to file supplementary submissions directed primarily to the prospective causes of action they might wish to pursue. They have acted upon this leave and, in quite some degree, have recast their cases for present purposes. This explains why matters which received some attention at the hearing are only dealt with cursorily in these reasons.

9 Much in the detail of what follows relates only to the first applicant, Scott Rush, and gives rise to potential claims unique to him. As will become apparent, the cases of the other three applicants arise from their involvement in events in which Scott Rush as well was implicated. The evidence in this matter was given by way of affidavit and without cross-examination. In relation to Rush's case I should also indicate that a number of affidavits have been read which expose significant conflicts of evidence between witnesses. I should indicate that I have not been asked in the circumstances to make findings in relation to contested issues of fact in the material before me, the respondent being prepared to accept that their resolution is for another day, if at all.</text>

<tocase>Enever v The King [1906] HCA 3 ; (1906) 3 CLR 969</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1906/3.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The AFP Act and the Australian Federal Police Regulations made under it apply both throughout and also "outside Australia": the AFP Act , s 5A. Finally, in abolishing the "independent discretion" rule exemplified in Enever v The King [1906] HCA 3 ; (1906) 3 CLR 969, s 64B provided (insofar as presently relevant) that: 
 
 
 "(1) The Commonwealth is liable in respect of a tort committed by a member in the performance or purported performance of his or her duties as such a member in like manner as a person is liable in respect of a tort committed by his or her employee in the course of his or her employment, and shall, in respect of such a tort, be treated for all purposes as a joint tortfeasor with the member."

36 This Act assumed its presently relevant form as a result of amendments made to it in 1996. The 1996 legislation aimed (to quote the "Outline" to the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1996 Bill) to:
 
 
 " clarify the areas in which mutual assistance in criminal matters may only be sought by the Attorney-General and the areas in which assistance may be sought using other channels 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to grant or request assistance without the Act having to be applied by regulation to a particular country 
 
 give the Attorney-General a discretion to refuse assistance where the request relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person for an offence in respect of which the death penalty could be imposed or carried out 
 
 enable the Attorney-General to refuse assistance where he considers it appropriate in the circumstances of a particular request."

37 The areas in which a request was required to be made by the Attorney-General, or to the Attorney-General in respect of a request by a foreign country, for international assistance in a criminal matter, were specified in the Act. Put shortly, they related to matters that would require either Australia (in respect of a foreign request) or the foreign country (in respect of an Australian request) to exercise coercive powers: see ss 5, 7, 10 and 11 and Parts II to VIIA of the Act; see also Second Reading Speech, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, House of Representatives, Wed 26 June 1996, 2831-2832.</text>

<tocase>Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 137 ALR 47</tocase>
<text>62 Other provisions both of the Mutual Assistance Act and of the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Indonesia make plain that no such limitation on the making of other requests was so intended. Section 6 of the Act expressly states that the Act does not prevent the provision etc of international assistance in criminal matters other than assistance of a kind that may be provided under that Act. Section 5 (the objects provision) states the purpose of the Act to be (inter alia) to facilitate the obtaining by Australia of international assistance in criminal matters: s 5(c). The interpretation of s 10(2) proposed by the applicants impedes rather than advances that purpose especially in light of s 6. Distinctly, the Mutual Assistance Treaty (the provisions of which limit the applicability of the Mutual Assistance Act to requests between Australia and Indonesia: see s 7(3)(a)) expressly provides that the Treaty does not derogate from obligations subsisting between the contracting parties, nor does it prevent them from providing assistance to each other: Art 2. Finally, if Parliament had intended through s 10(2) to impose such a fetter on obtaining international assistance in criminal matters as the applicants submit, thereby precluding the taking of such action as would otherwise be mandated by other legislation (e.g. the AFP Act : see below), one would have expected it to have spoken with far greater clarity than it has, the moreso given the purpose of the Act noted above: see Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 137 ALR 47 at 63-64.

63 I am in consequence satisfied that, on the proper construction of the Mutual Assistance Act, any foreshadowed cause of action founded on that Act must fail. In the circumstances it provides the applicants with no basis for any reasonable cause to believe they may have a right to obtain relief in this Court.

64 In supplementary submissions, the focus of the applicants' prospective ultra vires case turned to the provisions of the AFP Act . The relevant provisions of this Act and of directions given under it are set out at [33] to [35] above. It is now contended that the functions and powers set out in ss 8 and 9 of that Act, when read in context, do not include, authorise or justify any act or decision made by an AFP member which exposes an Australian citizen to the death penalty, whether in Australia or overseas. The context referred to in this submission is said to be provided by the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 ("the Abolition Act "), the provisions of s 8(1A) and (1B) of the Mutual Assistance Act, unambiguous Australian Government policy which is opposed to the death penalty (at least for its citizens) and Australia's signing of the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.</text>

<text>67 The international treaties and instrument that have been ratified by Australia and on which the applicants rely have not as such been incorporated into Australian law by express enactment. The Abolition Act pre-dated Australia's signing up to the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. Neither the Abolition Act nor the Protocol addresses action taken by Australian public officers or agencies vis-&agrave;-vis foreign law enforcement agencies in connection with offences in their jurisdiction which can there attract the death penalty. Neither expressly or impliedly prohibits taking such action as, for example, the provision of information of the type contained in the Hunniford letters. Neither expressly betrays an intent in relation to such action. The Abolition Act cannot thus properly be used to read down s 8 of the AFP Act . The Second Optional Protocol only came into effect for Australian purposes years after the enactment of s 8. It provides no contextual aid to the section's interpretation. In any event it imposes no obligation on a Contracting Party vis-&agrave;-vis a non-contracting party in respect of the former's dealings with the latter in relation to offences in the latter jurisdiction which can attract the death penalty. Even if s 8 was relevantly ambiguous, the Second Optional Protocol could not assist in resolving that ambiguity: see Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 306; Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade v Magno (1992) 37 FCR 298 at 303-304.

76 The applicants initially sought to contend that they had in Australian law an enforceable right to life and not to be executed. The ICCPR and the Second Optional Protocol were invoked to this end. This was later abandoned, as it had to be. The provisions of an international treaty do not form part of Australian law merely because Australia is a ratifying party to it. For that reason neither the ICCPR nor the Second Optional Protocol of itself "operate[s] to give rights to or impose duties on members of the Australian community: Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [35] ; see also Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 305-306.</text>

<tocase>Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987)</tocase>
<text>70 It may be possible to discern in Australian legislation, treaties, official guides, etc a declared antipathy to the death penalty. That antipathy, though, has not been pursued unqualifiedly in our legislation and guides in relation to dealings with foreign countries in respect of matters which could attract the imposition of the death penalty: cf the Mutual Assistance Act ss 8(1A) and (1B) and the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) s 22(3)(c). It is unsurprising that it has not. In particular contexts, the call of other public interests may be the more powerful. As was said in Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987) at 526: "Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice".</text>

<tocase>Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1974/20.html</AustLII>
<text>71 I do not consider that the applicants have made out any reasonable cause to believe they have an arguable case for the reading down of s 8 of the AFP Act . I should add for the sake of completeness that it may be the case that, even if the AFP Act were to be read down as contended for, it would not prevent members of the AFP from making the request they did in the absence of legislative authority: cf Barton v The Commonwealth [1974] HCA 20 ; (1974) 131 CLR 477 at 490. It is unnecessary to express any view on this.

72 A distinct way in which the applicants had proposed challenging the propriety of the AFP members' conduct in making the two requests was to contend that that conduct did not comply with the requirements of the Death Penalty Charge Guide such that, arguably, those members committed disciplinary offences under reg 4 of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979. It was not made at all apparent how, even if such disciplinary offences could have been made out, this would have availed the applicants.

73 As I understand the applicants' supplementary submissions they no longer rely upon breach of the Guide and Discipline Regulations. However, I should make the following comments in any event. First, and subject to what I later say, the Guide, on its face, may well be only of indirect relevance in this matter in that its substantive content is directed to how AFP members are required to act in relation to requests for assistance made of it by a foreign country. It is silent on requests made by the AFP of an overseas law enforcement agency. Secondly even if the standards prescribed in the Guide (with appropriate adaptation) be taken as the operative ones when a request is made by the AFP and I consider this was probably their intendment the conduct of the officers concerned in this case (whoever they may have been beyond Mr Hunniford) could not properly be said to have been relevantly in breach of the Guide as it related to "police to police" cooperation. The requests made and the information provided pre-dated the INP investigations and the arrests and detention of the applicants. In consequence it pre-dated any "charges being laid which may attract the death penalty" irrespective of how the term "charges" should be interpreted in the Guide as it applied to the formalities of the Indonesian legal system. Finally there was, as I have indicated, authority for the AFP members to make their request under the AFP Act and that in turn was translated into a practical arrangement with Indonesia in the Police Cooperation MoU under which, according to Mr Watson, the actual requests were made. The MoU is not in evidence before me for the reasons I earlier gave. Nonetheless, counsel for the applicant was provided with the opportunity to inspect the MoU or to have the Court inspect it, but declined to take either course. Counsel for the Commissioner has nonetheless indicated to the Court that the terms of the MoU contemplated the very provision of information by the AFP in circumstances such as in this matter and it could properly be said of the MoU that there was a standing request by Indonesia for such assistance. In the above circumstances, I am prepared to accept (a) that the applicants cannot claim reasonably to believe that the information provided to Indonesia was totally unsolicited and (b) that, possibly, the AFP in providing the information was acting upon a general request by Indonesia. However, for the reasons I gave above, I do not consider it to be of any consequence whether the request was made by the AFP or by Indonesia. The AFP members acted in conformity with the Death Penalty Charge Guide.

74 Despite their various and varying formulations of a potential cause of action based on what compendiously I have called acting without lawful authority, I am not satisfied that the applicants have been able to identify or articulate any reasonable cause to believe that they are or may be entitled to obtain relief in this Court under this rubric.</text>

<tocase>Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration (2002) 5 HKCFA 1</tocase>
<text>75 The potential cause of action advanced here is not one it is open to me to entertain as Australian authority now stands. The invitation held out to me is to embrace the law on "substantive legitimate expectation" as adumbrated in decisions of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration (2002) 5 HKCFA 1 and of the House of Lords in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; ex parte Zeqiri [2002] UKHL 3. The impediments to my so doing are substantial. As Sir Anthony Mason recently observed: "It would require a revolution in Australian judicial thinking to bring about an adoption of the English approach to substantive protection of legitimate expectations": (2005) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 103 at 108.

81 For present purposes all I need note of the "doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation" is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at [92]:
 
 "The doctrine recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation may, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court. Generally speaking, a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise, representation, practice or policy made, adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority." 
 

This in turn drew upon the reasons of Lord Woolf MR (for the court) in R v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213; see also Craig, Administrative Law, 639-656 (5 th ed 2003); Sedley, "The last 10 years' development of English public law", (2004) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 9 at 18-20.</text>

<text>76 The applicants initially sought to contend that they had in Australian law an enforceable right to life and not to be executed. The ICCPR and the Second Optional Protocol were invoked to this end. This was later abandoned, as it had to be. The provisions of an international treaty do not form part of Australian law merely because Australia is a ratifying party to it. For that reason neither the ICCPR nor the Second Optional Protocol of itself "operate[s] to give rights to or impose duties on members of the Australian community: Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [35] ; see also Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 305-306.</text>

<text>79 Even if (a) an obligation of procedural fairness could arise in the setting of present concern (see below) and (b) the alleged duty to be advised could properly be described as being procedural and not substantive in character: see Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 22; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ("Teoh") at 291; the particular expectation in question, arising as it allegedly did, was not one entertained by Scott Rush: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam ; [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ("Lam") at [36], [90]-[93], [95] and [145]. In consequence, Scott Rush would have been unable to show practical injustice done to himself: Lam , at [36]. As I understand it, from the applicants' supplementary written submissions, no reliance is now being placed by Scott Rush on a possible claim so framed.

82 In light of the decisions of the High Court in Teoh and in Lam it is clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is for the present not part of Australian law. For present purposes I need only refer to the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Lam at [66]-[67]:
 
 "The doctrine of 'legitimate expectation' has been developed in England so as to extend to an expectation that the benefit in question will be provided or, if already conferred, will not be withdrawn or that a threatened disadvantage or disability will not be imposed. This gives the doctrine a substantive, as distinct from procedural, operation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The earlier English decisions with respect to 'legitimate expectations' were discussed by Mason CJ in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin and by McHugh J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh . In Quin , Mason CJ observed: 
 
 
 
 'In the cases in this Court in which a legitimate expectation has been held entitled to protection, protection has taken the form of procedural protection, by insisting that the decision-maker apply the rules of natural justice. In none of the cases was the individual held to be entitled to substantive protection in the form of an order requiring the decision-maker to exercise his or her discretion in a particular way. The prevailing view in this Court has been, as Stephen J observed in Salemi [v MacKellar [No 2] ], that: '[t]he rules of natural justice are "in a broad sense a procedural matter"", echoing the words of Dixon CJ and Webb J in Commissioner of Police v Tanos .'

<tocase>R v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213</tocase>
<text>81 For present purposes all I need note of the "doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation" is what was said of it in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration at [92]:
 
 "The doctrine recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason of law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive outcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation may, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court. Generally speaking, a legitimate expectation arises as a result of a promise, representation, practice or policy made, adopted or announced by or on behalf of government or a public authority." 
 

This in turn drew upon the reasons of Lord Woolf MR (for the court) in R v North and East Devon Health Authority; Ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213; see also Craig, Administrative Law, 639-656 (5 th ed 2003); Sedley, "The last 10 years' development of English public law", (2004) 12 Aust Jo of Admin Law 9 at 18-20.</text>

<tocase>Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1997] QB 464 </tocase>
<text>86 What is immediately apparent in the above is that it attempts neither to locate the alleged duty to Scott Rush in the context of an ongoing AFP investigation nor to justify the imposition of the duty in such a context. Rather, it addresses the question whether the circumstances of Lee Rush's providing information to the AFP founded a reasonable expectation in Lee Rush that the AFP would not use, and an implied undertaking (though to whom is not stated) not to use, that information in a particular way. While that inquiry may be a step in the fashioning of an action for breach of confidence by Lee Rush, or a possible duty of care to Lee Rush (if, hypothetically, the unauthorised disclosure of the information would expose Mr Rush to a reasonably foreseeable risk: cf Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police [1997] QB 464), it does not lead necessarily or obviously to potential relief for Scott Rush in a negligence action by him. At best it hints at Lee Rush's having put the AFP in a position of power over Scott Rush, a position which carried with it an obligation not to exercise that power adversely to him. What I should emphasise as well is that whatever claims, if any, Lee Rush might be able to mount against an officer or officers of the AFP in consequence of their dealings and I do not suggest that the present circumstances suggest he might have any such claims he is not a party to this application.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/35.html</AustLII>
<text>87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason. In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 ("Tame") at [231] Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta:
 
 "It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation. Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officer's duty, ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained, fully to investigate the conduct in question." 
 

Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions (inter alia) of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53 ("Hill") at 63-65 and Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [60] . Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at [125]-[126]; Hayne J at [298] and by Callinan J at [335]-[336].

92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason. As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] . Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g. Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 ("Doe"); Eaton, "Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, "Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful.

95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g. Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame . In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is "an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]. Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.</text>

94 The progenitor of this principle was the decision of the House of Lords in Hill . After concluding that, in the circumstances of that case, the ordinary principles of negligence would not admit of a duty of care to a victim of crime, Lord Keith went on to indicate (at 63) that there was "another reason" why an action for damages in negligence should not be against the police in the circumstances of that case and that was "public policy". His Lordship then observed:
 
 "The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime. From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it. In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind. The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded. Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes. While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do. The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources. Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so. A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial. The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime. Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted. I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal [1988] QB 60, 76 in the present case, was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley [1967] UKHL 5 ; [1969] 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court."

101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan . I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail. However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g. Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame .

Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.</text>

<text>87 I referred above to the absence of reference to the context in which the duty allegedly owed Scott Rush is said to arise for this reason. In Tame v New South Wales [2002] HCA 35 ; (2002) 211 CLR 317 ("Tame") at [231] Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in dicta:
 
 "It is unlikely that an investigating police officer owes a duty of care to a person whose conduct is under investigation. Such a duty would appear to be inconsistent with the police officer's duty, ultimately based in the statutory framework and anterior common law by which the relevant police service is established and maintained, fully to investigate the conduct in question." 
 

Their Honours cited in support of this view the decisions (inter alia) of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [1987] UKHL 12 ; [1989] AC 53 ("Hill") at 63-65 and Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59 ; (2001) 207 CLR 562 at [60] . Similar views were expressed in Tame by McHugh J at [125]-[126]; Hayne J at [298] and by Callinan J at [335]-[336].

92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason. As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] . Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g. Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 ("Doe"); Eaton, "Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, "Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful.

95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g. Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .

102 Sullivan v Moody did not involve an allegation of negligence against police officers. Its concern was with whether medical practitioners and social workers who had examined children for evidence of sexual abuse by their fathers in the setting of a statutory regime containing provisions for the protection of children (including mandatory reporting to a government department of reasonable suspicion of child abuse), owed a duty of care to protect such fathers in the conduct of their examinations, investigations and reporting. It was held unanimously by the High Court that they did not. The plaintiff fathers had alleged that, as a result of negligent examination, diagnosis and reporting, they had suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and consequential personal and financial loss. Unsurprisingly, given the opinions expressed by the Court, Sullivan v Moody has been influential in this country in later decisions and judicial commentary on police liability for negligence in the conduct of investigations.

103 In rejecting the duty of care argued for in Sullivan v Moody the Court observed:
 
 
 "55. ... A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed. 
 
 56. How may a duty of the kind for which the appellants contend rationally be related to the functions, powers and responsibilities of the various persons and authorities who are alleged to owe that duty? A similar problem has arisen in other cases. The response to the problem in those cases, although not determinative, is instructive. 
 
 57. In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire , the House of Lords held that police officers did not owe a duty to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through their careless failure to apprehend a dangerous criminal. Lord Keith of Kinkel pointed out that the conduct of a police investigation involves a variety of decisions on matters of policy and discretion, including decisions as to priorities in the deployment of resources. To subject those decisions to a common law duty of care, and to the kind of judicial scrutiny involved in an action in tort, was inappropriate. 
 
 ... 
 
 60. The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party, or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised, does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff. People may be subject to a number of duties, at least provided they are not irreconcilable. A medical practitioner who examines, and reports upon the condition of, an individual, might owe a duty of care to more than one person. But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations, that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists. Similarly, when public authorities, or their officers, are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations, or exercising powers, in the public interest, or in the interests of a specified class of persons, the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations . 
 
 ... 
 
 62. The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was, relevantly, a scheme for the protection of children. It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount. Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon, allegations that the children had suffered, and were under threat of, serious harm. It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty, breach of which would sound in damages, to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm. The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily, either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents, or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount. As to the former, the functions of examination, and reporting, require, for their effective discharge, an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons. As to the latter, the interests of the children, and those suspected of causing their harm, are diverse, and irreconcilable. That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused, only a suspicion that it may have happened. The interests of the child, in such a case, would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled; the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect:" emphasis added.

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame . In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is "an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]. Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.

114 There is a short answer to the alleged duty. Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act, or had acted, in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so, neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer-Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged. The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation: cf Sullivan v Moody at [60].

115 I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to, and in making, the 8 and 12 April 2005 communications to the INP. They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions. The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation. The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP. It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided, as it did in the making of the request to the INP.

116 If, as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly, a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect. No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought, as I have noted, was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFP's statutory functions.

117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62]. Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants. Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it, that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question.</text>

<tocase>Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24 ; [2005] 1 WLR 1495</tocase>
<text>89 Before I express my own views on this, I should emphasise the following. Bearing in mind that this is an application for preliminary discovery where information about the possible commission of a tort is being sought, exceptional caution must be exercised before reaching a conclusion that, whatever the information that might be disclosed as a result of an order for information discovery, that information could make no difference for the reason that the duty contended for could not even arguably be imposed on AFP members when conducting the drug trafficking investigation in question: cf the observations of Lord Bingham in Brooks v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24 ; [2005] 1 WLR 1495 at [4] .

90 As noted earlier, there are conflicting versions as to the substance of the conversations between Robert Myers (on behalf of Lee Rush) and Mr Patching of the AFP. The alleged duty of care is premised upon acceptance of Myers' version of what transpired. For present purposes, and dealing with the matter on the basis most favourable to the applicants, I am prepared to assume the correctness of that version for the purposes of this application. Nonetheless, I am satisfied from what is already known about the circumstances surrounding Myers' communications with Patching, that the negligence claim as it has been framed would in any event be unarguable irrespective of any further information relevant to it that might conceivably be forthcoming if an order for information discovery were to be made. Accordingly, I am satisfied for the purposes of O 15A r 3 that no such proceeding for negligence could properly be brought in this Court and, for the purposes of O 15A r 6, there is no reasonable cause to believe that Scott Rush may have a right to obtain relief on the basis proposed.

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff. What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular "operational" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist. Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above.

101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan . I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail. However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g. Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2005/219.html</AustLII>
<text>92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason. As the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Tame illustrate, this inconsistency is often revealed where, in a setting in which injury is foreseeable if care is not taken in the conduct of a police investigation, a suspect, a victim, or a third party injured by acts or omissions of the police seeks to raise a claim in negligence against the police: Hill , above; Thompson v Vincent [2005] NSWCA 219 at [152] - [154] ; Batchelor v State of Tasmania [2005] TASSC 11 ; Cran v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 92 ; (2004) 62 NSWLR 95; see also D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 214 ALR 92 at [101] ; State of New South Wales v Paige [2002] NSWCA 235 ; (2002) 60 NSWLR 371 at [115] - [117] . Save in exceptional circumstances: cf Hill at 62; Batchelor , above; and in North America see e.g. Doe v Board of Commissioners for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1990) 72 DLR 4 th 580 ("Doe"); Eaton, "Liability of Municipality or Other Governmental Unit for Failure to Provide Police Protection from Crime" 90 ALR 5 th 273 at SS4 ; 57 Am Jur 2d, "Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability", SSSS407-418; such attempts have been unsuccessful.

95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g. Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .

96 I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country; see Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; or whether the "principle" does no more than represent the usual or predictable, but not invariable, consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [149] . Before so doing, it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm. The contrary is clearly the case, as a large case law in common law jurisdictions, including England, attests: Zalewski v Turcarolo ; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police [1999] 1 All ER 550; see also Grubb (ed), The Law of Tort , "The Police" 16.73 ff (2002); Linden, Canadian Tort Law , 286, 625 (7 th ed 2001); Todd (ed), The Law of Torts in New Zealand , 204, 212 ff (3 rd ed, 2001); Eaton, above 90 ALR 5 th 273.

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff.

100 In contrast, the 1995 decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the recent Tasmanian decision of Batchelor v State of Tasmania are more questioning of whether the immunity principle (at least in the scope given it) is part of Australian law.</text>

99 Australian case law, while generally conforming in its results with particularly comparable English decisions, has not unreservedly committed itself to the public policy immunity prevailing in England. The Court of Appeal of New South Wales on a number of occasions and most recently in Cran v State of New South Wales has adopted an approach to cases involving investigative conduct that reflects the immunity principle found in English decisions and particularly Hill's case. In Cran v State of New South Wales it was noted by Santow JA that in Tame's case, "there are strong dicta suggesting that the English authorities would be followed in Australia" (at [35]) and that "on present authority [in New South Wales] the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the police ... preclude[d] any duty of care to the appellant" (at [63]) in that case where a prisoner claimed damages for post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from unnecessarily prolonged imprisonment because of delay in a police investigation.

104 As I earlier noted, the judgment of Gummow and Kirby JJ in Tame relied on Sullivan at [60] above when expressing the view that it was unlikely that an investigating police officer would owe a duty of care to a person whose conduct was under investigation. Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame . In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is "an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154].

117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62]. Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants.

<text>92 It equally is well recognised that to impose common law duties of care on police officers to a particular member or members of the public in addition to their duty to the general public can, on occasion, be "inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of [their public] responsibilities": cf Sullivan v Moody , at [62]; (whether those responsibilities arise under a statute such as the AFP Act or at common law) and to be impermissible for that reason.

<tocase>Calveley v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1989] 1 AC 1228</tocase>
<text>93 Primary concerns manifest in English and, in some degree, Australian case law have been to maintain the effectiveness of particular police functions (and notably the conduct of investigations and the suppression of crime) and to avert their compromise or undermining by the imposition of a duty to an individual (or individuals) over and above that owed to the public. In English law this has led to the adoption of an exclusionary principle (or immunity) which is often cast in broad terms. So, for example, in Calveley v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police [1989] 1 AC 1228 it was said by Lord Bridge (at 1238) that:
 
 "... it would plainly be contrary to public policy ... to prejudice the fearless and efficient discharge by police officers of their vitally important public duty of investigating crime by requiring them to act under the shadow of a potential action for damages for negligence by the suspect."</text>

<tocase>Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562</tocase>
<text>95 Hill's case, I would note, has been referred to approvingly in some number of High Court judgments: see e.g. Sullivan v Moody at [57]; Tame at [231], [335]; see also Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; Cran v State of New South Wales , at [33] ff; but cf contra Zalewski v Turcarolo [1995] 2 VR 562 a decision which pre-dated Sullivan v Moody .

96 I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country; see Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; or whether the "principle" does no more than represent the usual or predictable, but not invariable, consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [149] . Before so doing, it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm. The contrary is clearly the case, as a large case law in common law jurisdictions, including England, attests: Zalewski v Turcarolo ; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police [1999] 1 All ER 550; see also Grubb (ed), The Law of Tort , "The Police" 16.73 ff (2002); Linden, Canadian Tort Law , 286, 625 (7 th ed 2001); Todd (ed), The Law of Torts in New Zealand , 204, 212 ff (3 rd ed, 2001); Eaton, above 90 ALR 5 th 273.

97 By way of illustration I would note that a duty of care has been assumed, or found to exist:
 
 (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); 
 (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; 
 (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); 
 (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); 
 (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police );
 (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as "bait" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and
 (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, "Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call" , 39 ALR 4 th 691).</text>

<tocase>Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540</tocase>

<text>96 I will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country; see Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154]; or whether the "principle" does no more than represent the usual or predictable, but not invariable, consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54 ; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [149] . Before so doing, it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm. The contrary is clearly the case, as a large case law in common law jurisdictions, including England, attests: Zalewski v Turcarolo ; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police [1999] 1 All ER 550; see also Grubb (ed), The Law of Tort , "The Police" 16.73 ff (2002); Linden, Canadian Tort Law , 286, 625 (7 th ed 2001); Todd (ed), The Law of Torts in New Zealand , 204, 212 ff (3 rd ed, 2001); Eaton, above 90 ALR 5 th 273.

101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan . I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail. However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g. Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.

107 First, it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function, i.e. the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth. The particular subject of the inquiry transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking - fell within areas of "special emphasis" in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004. As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals, the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of (inter alia) the applicants. That letter indicated the AFP's purpose in making its request was that "[t]he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers (other than CHAN) in Australia". In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request. If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care, this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [147].

108 Secondly, there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely.

109 The Myer-Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush, not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular. I assume for the purposes of this application, that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence. I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence. However, it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers. Rather it appears to be said that, having regard (a) to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush, and (b) the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush's departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given, the AFP's failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia. Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court.</text>

97 By way of illustration I would note that a duty of care has been assumed, or found to exist:
 
 (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); 
 (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; 
 (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); 
 (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); 
 (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police );
 (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as "bait" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and
 (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, "Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call" , 39 ALR 4 th 691).

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff. What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular "operational" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist. Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above.

101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan .

 (i) in the conduct of a high speed police motor vehicle pursuit of a suspected criminal ( Schilling v Lenton (1988) 47 SASR 88; see also Marshall v Osmond [1983] 1 QB 1034; 57 Am Jur 2d, above SS439); 
 (ii) where a superior officer failed to go to the assistance of another officer whom he knew was being attacked close by and for whom he had a responsibility ( Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police , above; Mullaney v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2001] EWCA Civ 700) ; 
 (iii) in positively provoking or acting in disregard of a real and substantial risk of harm to a person ( Zalewski v Turcarolo , above) or property ( Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 WLR 1242); 
 (iv) in providing for the safety and well-being of persons in police custody ( Hall v Whatmore [1961] VR 225; Howard v Jarvis [1958] HCA 19 ; (1958) 98 CLR 177; Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1999] UKHL 35 ; [2000] 1 AC 360); 
 (v) in relation to preserving the confidentiality of information provided by an informant identifying a criminal suspect, the disclosure of which was likely to expose the informant and her husband to a greater risk of harm at the hands of the suspect than the ordinary risk to the general public ( Swinney v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police );
 (vi) in Canada, to protect a woman who was unaware she was knowingly being used by police as "bait" to catch a serial rapist in circumstances in which the police deliberately failed to warn of the risk she faced for fear of compromising their investigation though knowing that the rapist would attack again and cause irreparable harm to his victim ( Doe v Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police (1998) 160 DLR 4 th 697); and
 (vii) in a United States jurisdiction, in delaying in responding to calls made by assault victims, the assurance that help was on its way having been given to them ( Chambers-Castanes v King County 669 P2d 451 (1983); and see Zitter, "Liability for Failure of Police Response to Emergency Call" , 39 ALR 4 th 691).

98 What is noticeable in the case law of common law countries illustrated above (including that of England) is that it is accepted both that positive dangerous behaviour by police can still attract a duty of care and that, particularly in cases of omissions to act, the police may nonetheless have, or have assumed such a particular responsibility to take care of a person as to give rise to a "special relationship" with that person which attracts a duty of care to him or her: see e.g. Brooks v Commissioner of Police at [22] and [29]; Costello v Chief Constable of the Northumbria Police esp per May LJ; in US jurisdictions the "special relationship" exception is well recognised in a range of otherwise negligence exempt areas of police activity, see e.g. Eaton, above at SS4 ; see also 57 Am Jur 2d, above, at SS410 ff. What equally is notable is the varying significance given to the particular "operational" context in which the relationship giving rise to a duty of care is said to exist. Hence the ready imposition of a duty of care to persons in police custody: Hall v Whatmore , above; and the corresponding reluctance to impose such a duty in the context of the conduct of a criminal investigation D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at [101]-[102]; see also Cran v State of New South Wales , above; or in preventing a breach of the peace: Thompson v Vincent , above.</text>

<tocase>Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699</tocase>
<text>101 It is, in my view, unnecessary in this matter to express a concluded view on whether, as in England, a special though not unqualified, immunity rule applies to police activities "in the investigation and suppression of crime": Costello's case at 563; or whether the duty of care question is to be answered by applying to police those principles now generally applied to public authorities in the discharge of their statutory and, if relevant, common law functions: see Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan . I am of this view because both binding and persuasive authority lead inevitably to the conclusion that this application must fail. However, I would respectfully suggest that more recent English authority demonstrating "reluctance to endorse the full breadth of what Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire ... has been thought to lay down" on the immunity of police: cf Brooks v Commissioner of Police , at [3], [6] and [28]; and the difficulty in providing criteria to mark out exceptions to that immunity: see e.g. Costello ; Cowan v The Chief Constable for Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary [2001] EWCA Civ 1699 ; tell in favour of avoiding any special rule applicable to police, while still acknowledging that the police function can have distinctive characteristics and purposes which in many settings may exclude the concurrent operation of a duty of care at common law: cf Doe , 72 DLR 4 th at 584-586.</text>

<text>105 In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation. Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517. And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP. Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn).</text>

<tocase>O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1180.html</AustLII>
<text>110 It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers. I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160. My reasoning in that case is "equally applicable to the Northern Territory": ALRC Report 92, The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth, 652 (2001).

111 The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information, i.e. Lee Rush, but to the subject of it, i.e. Scott Rush. Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one. It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all. Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.</text>

<text>112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia. The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct: cf Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 esp at 456. And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information, the effect of which would have been to obstruct the administration of the criminal law: A v Hayden [1984] HCA 67 ; (1984) 156 CLR 532.</text>

<tocase>Sanders v Snell (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 150 ; (2003) 130 FCR 149 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/150.html</AustLII>
<text>121 It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the elements of this tort in any detail. They were recently essayed by the Full Court of this Court in Sanders v Snell (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 150 ; (2003) 130 FCR 149. I would note, though, that the tort can take two forms. In one form (that of "targeted malice") it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons. In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury: see generally Sanders v Snell (No 2) at [95]-[100].

122 The applicants' contentions in relation to this tort require that close attention be given to the requirements of O 15A r 6 in particular. I emphasise this for this reason.</text>

<tocase>L (a child) v Reading Borough Council [2001] EWCA Civ 346 ; [2001] 1 WLR 1575</tocase>
<text>123 The essence of the misfeasance tort in either of its forms is the "dishonest abuse of power": L (a child) v Reading Borough Council [2001] EWCA Civ 346 ; [2001] 1 WLR 1575 at 1588. I am in complete agreement with the submissions of the respondent that there is no basis at all in the material before me to suggest any reasonable cause to believe that Mr Hunniford or other AFP officers acted with the reckless indifference asserted in the applicants' supplementary written submissions. What is being advanced is at best "a mere possibility". The evidence does not "incline the mind" towards assenting to the proposition asserted: cf St George Bank Pty Ltd v Rabo at [26].

124 I have already indicated that the actions of the AFP officers concerned with the decisions and actions which led to the applicants' arrest were not of themselves ultra vires. There is no reasonable cause to believe that the decisions or actions were invalid because they were improperly motivated or that the officers were recklessly indifferent to the possible lack of power or validity in making those decisions or actions. Rather, on the evidence, they were referable to the Police Cooperation MoU with Indonesia. And while it was a foreseeable and likely consequence of the 8 and 12 April letters to the INP, that the applicants would be arrested in Indonesia and in that sense be exposed to harm in the sense of being put at risk of the death penalty, there is again no material at all which could objectively incline me to the proposition that the likelihood of that harm was other than a possible consequence of what was in the circumstances a valid exercise of official power.</text>
