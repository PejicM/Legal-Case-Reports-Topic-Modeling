<tocase>Ace Business Brokers Pty Ltd v Phillips-Treby (2000) 100 IR 420</tocase>
<text>19 There is Full Bench authority in the New South Wales Industrial Commission, in Court Session, which would support an argument that "the making of representations known to be acted upon by a person in considering entry into a contractual relationship and on the basis of which representations an agent as the representor intends the person to act may well, quite apart from any other connection with the contract subsequently made, be itself an arrangement whereby work is performed in an industry, or, at the least, a collateral arrangement to such a contract or arrangement": Ace Business Brokers Pty Ltd v Phillips-Treby (2000) 100 IR 420, at 432, [28]. Contrary to the submission of the BoQ parties, it is thus not impossible for a representation to constitute an "arrangement". Further, if it is one, as the amended summons apparently alleges, and the submissions of the BoQ parties seem to ignore, whereby a person performs work in an industry, that arrangement, if unfair, may, all other things being equal, be the subject of relief under s 106 of the NSW Act. The Independent Contractors Act may or may not intrude on the ability to grant that relief, but that is not a matter for summary resolution.

22 The vice in these paragraphs is not, as the BoQ parties would have it, that of "labelling representations as arrangements". As Ace Business Brokers Pty Ltd v Phillips-Treby (2000) 100 IR 420 demonstrates, if a representation becomes one whereby a person performs work in an industry, it is possible for that to fall within the expansive definition of "contract" in the NSW Act and to become a subject for the granting of relief under s 106 of the NSW Act in the event of unfairness being demonstrated. Rather, as the BoQ parties would also have it, the vice in these paragraphs is that they are directed to the end of making controversial in this Court whether what are termed in these paragraphs "the Meeting Arrangements" were false or misleading and therefore unfair at the time when they were made or became unfair for the purposes of s 106 of the NSW Act.

23 In the earlier interlocutory appeal the Full Court observed (at [16]) that, "Whether the Bank was capable of misleading the OMB parties seems to us to be irrelevant to the question of whether the OMB parties were independent contractors. Whether it did mislead is clearly irrelevant." At one level, there is a certain tension between these observations and the BoQ parties' submission with regard to para 52(c) and paras 57 to 63 of the amended defence. In part, that submission did more than take the case as pleaded in the amended summons as a given and sought to strike it so much of it as was predicated upon the proposition that a representation could amount to an arrangement.

24 Be that as it may, paras 70 to 83 as presently cast do more than detail the nature of the case for the OMB parties before the New South Wales Industrial Court. Instead, these paragraphs are directed to the end of creating a controversy in this Court as to whether particular representations alleged in the amended summons were false or misleading and whether what are termed "the Meeting Arrangements" were or became unfair see paras 72, 73, 75, 76 and 83 of the amended defence. In this Court, as the Full Court has observed, the merits of that particular controversy are irrelevant.</text>

<tocase>Bank of Queensland Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCA 324</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/324.html</AustLII>
<text>36 Paragraphs 110 to 116 of the amended defence make allegations as to the effect of particular clauses within an OMB Agreement either alone or, as the case may be, when read with what is described as "the Fit-out Loan" and then plead that the clause or clauses concerned do not constitute a contract for services. In an earlier interlocutory judgment in respect of the then defence, Bank of Queensland Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCA 324 at [92] to [94] Greenwood J ordered to be struck out particular paragraphs which did no more than set out a contended construction of an OMB Agreement to be struck out. In the subsequent interlocutory appeal, Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81 at [12] [13], the Full Court expressed agreement with the "general thrust" of this approach.

37 Two features of the pleading rules found in O 11 of the Federal Court Rules might be noted:
 
(a) a pleading should state material facts O 11 r 2; and
 
(b) it is nonetheless permissible to raise a point of law in a pleading O 11 r 9.
 
As Greenwood J emphasised in his interlocutory judgment (at [92]), the relevant fact is the entry into the OMB Agreement. It would, in my opinion, be permissible, for example, to raise in a defence a consequential point of law namely, that, on its true construction, the OMB Agreement was not a "services contract" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . The paragraphs concerned do more than that and instead offer a series of contended for constructions of the agreement or parts thereof. My understanding of the Full Court's agreement with the "broad thrust" of the approach taken by Greenwood J is that such contentions were a matter for submissions at trial, not pleading.

38 There was debate before me as to whether paras 110 to 116 of the amended defence fell within or outside the type of pleading that Greenwood J had ordered to be struck out. It seems to me that the paragraphs fall within the type which his Honour considered ought to be struck out.

39 These paragraphs of the amended defence are directed to the subject of an alleged inability on the part of those who became parties to an OMB Agreement independently to assess the viability of the business governed by that agreement because the Bank did not make available the requisite information. The end to which they are directed is the drawing of a conclusion that those parties were not "independent contractors" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act .

40 The point taken for the BoQ parties is that these allegations are not relevant to the drawing of that conclusion.

57 In my opinion, a more accurate critique is offered by the BoQ parties. Their contention is that the paragraphs plead characterisations of the OMB Agreements in a similar way to that which Greenwood J found in his interlocutory judgment and later the Full Court found to be inappropriate in a pleading. I have already referred to his Honour's and the Full Court's views in my consideration above of paras 110 to 116 of the amended defence.

58 Another feature of the allegations in paras 137 to 148 of the amended defence is highlighted by the BoQ parties in their submissions, namely allegations concerning the subjective intention or purpose of the Bank. The submission is advanced, with which I agree, that the Bank's subjective intention or purpose is not relevant to whether a respondent who is a party to an OMB Agreement ought to be characterised as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . The task is one of objective characterisation having regard to the terms of an agreement and the way it was carried out. The existence or otherwise of goodwill vested in a non-bank party to an OMB Agreement may also be relevant. The subjective intentions or purposes of either such a party or the Bank, except insofar as they may manifest themselves in the way an agreement was carried out, are not facts relevant to that characterisation task.

59 Paragraphs 137 to 148 of the amended defence should be struck out.

60 The BoQ parties advance the submission that paras 162, 163(a) and 163(c) of the amended defence are founded upon the premise that this Court is precluded from adjudicating upon the issues raised by the amended application by reason of a privative clause found in s 179 of the NSW Act. The response of the OMB parties is that these paragraphs are replications of paragraphs in the defence as originally filed the striking out of which was sought before but declined by Greenwood J. Regard to his Honour's interlocutory judgment at [101], [102] and [104] bears out the correctness of the OMB parties' response. As the OMB parties further contend, the declining to strike out these paragraphs was not challenged in the interlocutory appeal.

61 The proposition that a State Parliament can by a privative clause in its legislation preclude this Court from exercising a jurisdiction with which it is invested by s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) is certainly startlingly. However, given that there has already been a failed attempt to strike out the paragraphs which was not pursued in the interlocutory appeal, it seems to me that the better course is not to strike out the paragraphs concerned but to leave the issues of law which they raise for determination at trial. The BoQ parties are not in any way precluded by that course from then pursuing their submission that there is no merit in the issues raised by those paragraphs. Assuming that the OMB parties chose to press those issues, I doubt that their consideration will much add to the length of the trial.

62 Paragraph 163(f) of the amended defence advances a contention that the determination of the issues raised by the amended defence require a trial of the facts. Even allowing for the reduction in the number of issues which will be a consequence of my ordering the striking out of various paragraphs, it is still the case that a trial of the facts is required. I note that Greenwood J declined in his interlocutory judgment (at [104]) to strike out an earlier formulation in the defence of what is now sub-para 163(f). I decline to strike out sub-para 163(f).

63 Sub-paragraph 163(g) of the amended defence, properly understood, pleads a proposition that the passage from its reasons for judgment which I have quoted above demonstrates the Full Court accepted in its interlocutory judgment namely, that the determination of whether the Independent Contractors Act operates to the exclusion of s 106 of the NSW Act is a matter that will require an examination of more than just the terms of the OMB Agreement. I note that Greenwood J (at [104]) declined to strike out an earlier formulation of this sub-paragraph and that this was not challenged on the interlocutory appeal. I likewise decline to strike out sub-paragraph 163(g).

64 I will hear the parties as to whether, given the extent to which paragraphs of the amended defence have been ordered to be struck out, leave to file and serve a further amended defence ought to be granted and in respect of the costs of the notice of motion.

 I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/42.html</AustLII>
<text>33 This justification for para 108 is, with respect, misdirected. The OMB parties are on firmer ground in their further submission that whether or not there may be goodwill vested in an OMB party to an OMB Agreement is, or at least is arguably, relevant to a conclusion that that party is an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . One of the factors to which Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ adverted in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (at 42, [48]) in determining that the bicycle couriers were not independent contractors at common law was that they were unable to generate "goodwill" as a bicycle courier. It is settled that goodwill cannot be assigned in gross but rather passes with the transfer of rights to conduct a business in substantially the same manner and by substantially the same means as before: Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at 615, [23] and 617-618, [30] and [31]. It is not impossible in these circumstances to see how, for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act and irrespective of a technical ability to assign the benefit of an OMB Agreement, it might be relevant in deciding whether a party to such an agreement was to be characterised as an "independent contractor" that either no "goodwill" vested in that party or in any event that none would pass on an assignment.</text>

<tocase>Daly v Egan (1886) 12 VLR 81</tocase>
<text>20 Well over a century ago, in Daly v Egan (1886) 12 VLR 81 , at 84, a Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria observed of the jurisdiction to give summary judgment that:
 This summary jurisdiction is not intended to be exercised where the defendant has any plausible defence, or disputes any of the material facts. A Judge in chambers is not to try a case on affidavit where the facts are in dispute. 
See also to like effect in that same year observations made by Holroyd J in White v Johnston (1886) 8 ALT 53. Thus, when in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 105 , at 129-130 Barwick CJ cited with approval the following observation of Dixon J (as he then was) in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 , at 91 that:
 The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious, But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process, 

he was not promoting any novel approach to the disposal of an application like the present. The approach described had been evident since colonial times. Real questions of law and fact are raised by para 52(c) and paras 57 to 63 of the amended defence. It is not appropriate to deal with them summarily. Further, that there are presently hypothetical qualities to the questions of law sought to be agitated by the BoQ parties is an added reason, in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, for this Court not to answer them at this stage. The courts created by the Commonwealth Parliament under Chapter III of the Constitution do not give advisory opinions: In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257.</text>

<tocase>Fish v Solutions 6 Holdings Ltd (2006) 225 CLR 180</tocase>
<text>16 For the BoQ parties, emphasis was given to the jurisprudence which had developed in respect of s 106 of the NSW Act and its predecessors to the effect that the jurisdiction was engaged so long as the "contract" led "directly" to the performance of work in an industry: Fish v Solutions 6 Holdings Ltd (2006) 225 CLR 180 at 192, [27] and Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1976-1977) 136 CLR 190 at 200-201. In their joint judgment in the more recent of these cases, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Crennan JJ noted (at [28]) that "the description of a contract as 'one which leads directly to a person performing work in any industry' is not without its difficulty" (emphasis in original). Their Honours cautioned (ibid) that this and other glosses on the language of s 106 ought not to be permitted to divert argument away from the language of the section. Later in that case (at [42]) their Honours observed:
 It is the arrangements (contractual and non-contractual) whereby a person performs work in an industry that the Commission may avoid or vary. That is, it is the arrangements (contractual and non-contractual) according to which a person performs the work (or in consequence of which or in fulfilment of which a person performs that work) which may be avoided or varied. And although the notion of 'avoiding' an arrangement that is not enforceable may be awkward, determining that some new arrangement will obtain for the future (thus 'varying' the arrangement) presents no such awkward juxtaposition of ideas. Further, to focus attention upon the arrangements whereby a person performs work in an industry, no matter whether the arrangement is found in the contract the parties have made or only in some related condition or collateral arrangement, sufficiently meets the need, identified by Barwick CJ in Brown v Rezitis, to recognise that these provisions of the Act have, as one important purpose, dealing with subterfuges which take workers outside the operation of industrial instruments intended to protect workers in an industry. At the same time, to read s 106 as hinged about performance of work in any industry and empowering the Commission to deal only with such of the arrangements between parties as can be described as a contract whereby a person performs work in any industry confines the jurisdiction of the Commission to declare a contract void or to vary it within bounds that leave intact the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over other kinds of contractual obligations.

<tocase>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/69.html</AustLII>
<text>5 The BoQ parties have applied, pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules , to strike out those paragraphs of the amended defence identified in the notice of motion by which the application was brought. They expressly eschew reliance upon s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That means that the application falls for determination having regard to the circumspection in relation to the striking out of a pleading counselled by authorities such as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

6 In the substantive proceeding the case advanced by the BoQ parties may be summarised as follows:
 
(a) each of the OMB parties who entered into an OMB Agreement was an "independent contractor";
 
(b) each respective OMB Agreement related to the performance of work by that party as an independent contractor;
 
(c) there exists in each respective case the requisite constitutional connection specified in s 5(2) of the Independent Contractors Act 2006 (Cth);
 
(d) accordingly, each respective OMB Agreement is a "services contract" as defined by s 5(1) of the Independent Contractors Act ;
 
(e) s 106 of the NSW Act is a law of a State which expressly provides for a court to make an order or determination in relation to a "services contract" on an unfairness ground setting aside, declaring void or amending or varying that contract;
 
(f) the effect of s 7(1)(c) of the Independent Contractors Act and s 109 of the Constitution is that the OMB Agreements are not affected by s 106 of the NSW Act;
 
(g) accordingly, the Industrial Court of New South Wales has no jurisdiction to make an order under s 106 of the NSW Act in respect of the OMB Agreements.

20 Well over a century ago, in Daly v Egan (1886) 12 VLR 81 , at 84, a Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria observed of the jurisdiction to give summary judgment that:
 This summary jurisdiction is not intended to be exercised where the defendant has any plausible defence, or disputes any of the material facts. A Judge in chambers is not to try a case on affidavit where the facts are in dispute.

<tocase>Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 207 CLR 21</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/44.html</AustLII>
<text>7 A major legal and factual premise of the BoQ parties' case is that each of the OMB parties who are parties to an OMB Agreement should be classified as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . That term is defined by s 4 of that Act but only in a way that declares that an "independent contractor" is not limited to a natural person. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for the purposes of this interlocutory application to reach a concluded view as to meaning of the term. It is enough to observe that, subject the declaration in the definition, the question of whether a party to a contract, corporate or individual, is or is not an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act has been seemingly left by the Parliament to be determined having regard by analogy to principles of the common law developed in modern times by cases such as Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 207 CLR 21 and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16.

8 On the pleadings, whether it should be concluded that each of the OMB parties who is a party to an OMB Agreement should be classified as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act is controversial. In an earlier interlocutory appeal in this proceeding, Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81 at [9] , the Full Court observed:
 The question of what are the terms of the written agreement between the OMB parties and the Bank parties and their effect does not necessarily determine the legal issue of whether the OMB parties are independent contractors for the purposes of s 5 of the Commonwealth Act. While it is unnecessary for us to express a concluded view on this question, it may well be that the expression 'independent contractor' in that section is intended to reflect the common law concept of what is an independent contractor as it applies in relation to natural persons, though we note that an independent contractor, as defined, is not limited to a natural person. If this is correct then the issue might be determined not only by reference to the terms of the contract between the principal and the alleged independent contractor but also by reference to the way in which the parties carry out or give effect to the contract between them: see Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 207 CLR 21 particularly at 40-41. As noted earlier, the OMB parties contended they are not independent contractors and the Bank parties contended they are. That being so, the OMB parties are entitled to plead and prove facts (unless admitted by the Bank parties) concerning the way in which the contractual arrangements have been carried out as part of proving that they are not independent contractors. This is so even if, ultimately, the issue falls to be decided primarily or solely by reference to the written agreements between the parties, and this now appears to be conceded now by the Bank parties.

33 This justification for para 108 is, with respect, misdirected. The OMB parties are on firmer ground in their further submission that whether or not there may be goodwill vested in an OMB party to an OMB Agreement is, or at least is arguably, relevant to a conclusion that that party is an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . One of the factors to which Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ adverted in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd (at 42, [48]) in determining that the bicycle couriers were not independent contractors at common law was that they were unable to generate "goodwill" as a bicycle courier. It is settled that goodwill cannot be assigned in gross but rather passes with the transfer of rights to conduct a business in substantially the same manner and by substantially the same means as before: Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at 615, [23] and 617-618, [30] and [31]. It is not impossible in these circumstances to see how, for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act and irrespective of a technical ability to assign the benefit of an OMB Agreement, it might be relevant in deciding whether a party to such an agreement was to be characterised as an "independent contractor" that either no "goodwill" vested in that party or in any event that none would pass on an assignment.

48 The BoQ parties' point is certainly not clear to demonstration. In the face of a statutory definition of "independent contractor" which provides that an "independent contractor" is not limited to a natural person, recourse to an Explanatory Memorandum which seeks to promote the notion that the Act is concerned with an independent contractor/ employee distinction may be nothing more than a distraction from giving attention to the language of the definition in the Act itself in the context in which it appears. If nothing else, and given that a corporation cannot be an employee at common law, the way that the definition of "independent contractor" is cast gives pause for thought about whether it might be possible to have a corporate contractor whom one would not conclude was an independent contactor, applying by analogy tests laid down in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd , supra and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd , supra. I expressly refrain from reaching a concluded view on that subject at an interlocutory stage.</text>

<tocase>McDonald's Australia Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Qld) 2004 ATC 4970</tocase>
<text>35 While one might question whether, for example, the consensual premature extinguishment of an OMB Agreement at the initiative of the Bank could strictly yield a transfer of goodwill to the Bank: McDonald's Australia Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Qld) 2004 ATC 4970 ; (2004) 57 ATR 395 (Chesterman J), another way of viewing this aspect of the allegations made in paragraph 108 of the amended defence is that such goodwill as may exist is inherently personal and unlikely to command value other than if the Bank for one reason or another wanted to be liberated from being bound by the OMB Agreement. It is neither necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this application to do anything other than conclude that the existence or otherwise of goodwill, the identification of the sources of any such goodwill and consideration of whether any goodwill would pass on an assignment such as cl 33,1 of the OMB Agreement permits is conceivably relevant to the question of whether a non-Bank party to an OMB Agreement is to be characterised as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act and raises triable issues of law and fact. The application to strike out paragraph 108 fails.</text>

<tocase>Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/81.html</AustLII>
<text>8 On the pleadings, whether it should be concluded that each of the OMB parties who is a party to an OMB Agreement should be classified as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act is controversial. In an earlier interlocutory appeal in this proceeding, Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81 at [9] , the Full Court observed:
 The question of what are the terms of the written agreement between the OMB parties and the Bank parties and their effect does not necessarily determine the legal issue of whether the OMB parties are independent contractors for the purposes of s 5 of the Commonwealth Act. While it is unnecessary for us to express a concluded view on this question, it may well be that the expression 'independent contractor' in that section is intended to reflect the common law concept of what is an independent contractor as it applies in relation to natural persons, though we note that an independent contractor, as defined, is not limited to a natural person. If this is correct then the issue might be determined not only by reference to the terms of the contract between the principal and the alleged independent contractor but also by reference to the way in which the parties carry out or give effect to the contract between them: see Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 207 CLR 21 particularly at 40-41. As noted earlier, the OMB parties contended they are not independent contractors and the Bank parties contended they are. That being so, the OMB parties are entitled to plead and prove facts (unless admitted by the Bank parties) concerning the way in which the contractual arrangements have been carried out as part of proving that they are not independent contractors. This is so even if, ultimately, the issue falls to be decided primarily or solely by reference to the written agreements between the parties, and this now appears to be conceded now by the Bank parties.

36 Paragraphs 110 to 116 of the amended defence make allegations as to the effect of particular clauses within an OMB Agreement either alone or, as the case may be, when read with what is described as "the Fit-out Loan" and then plead that the clause or clauses concerned do not constitute a contract for services. In an earlier interlocutory judgment in respect of the then defence, Bank of Queensland Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCA 324 at [92] to [94] Greenwood J ordered to be struck out particular paragraphs which did no more than set out a contended construction of an OMB Agreement to be struck out. In the subsequent interlocutory appeal, Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81 at [12] [13], the Full Court expressed agreement with the "general thrust" of this approach.</text>

<tocase>Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1976-1977) 136 CLR 190</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/4.html</AustLII>
<text>16 For the BoQ parties, emphasis was given to the jurisprudence which had developed in respect of s 106 of the NSW Act and its predecessors to the effect that the jurisdiction was engaged so long as the "contract" led "directly" to the performance of work in an industry: Fish v Solutions 6 Holdings Ltd (2006) 225 CLR 180 at 192, [27] and Stevenson v Barham [1977] HCA 4 ; (1976-1977) 136 CLR 190 at 200-201. In their joint judgment in the more recent of these cases, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Crennan JJ noted (at [28]) that "the description of a contract as 'one which leads directly to a person performing work in any industry' is not without its difficulty" (emphasis in original). Their Honours cautioned (ibid) that this and other glosses on the language of s 106 ought not to be permitted to divert argument away from the language of the section. Later in that case (at [42]) their Honours observed:
 It is the arrangements (contractual and non-contractual) whereby a person performs work in an industry that the Commission may avoid or vary. That is, it is the arrangements (contractual and non-contractual) according to which a person performs the work (or in consequence of which or in fulfilment of which a person performs that work) which may be avoided or varied. And although the notion of 'avoiding' an arrangement that is not enforceable may be awkward, determining that some new arrangement will obtain for the future (thus 'varying' the arrangement) presents no such awkward juxtaposition of ideas. Further, to focus attention upon the arrangements whereby a person performs work in an industry, no matter whether the arrangement is found in the contract the parties have made or only in some related condition or collateral arrangement, sufficiently meets the need, identified by Barwick CJ in Brown v Rezitis, to recognise that these provisions of the Act have, as one important purpose, dealing with subterfuges which take workers outside the operation of industrial instruments intended to protect workers in an industry. At the same time, to read s 106 as hinged about performance of work in any industry and empowering the Commission to deal only with such of the arrangements between parties as can be described as a contract whereby a person performs work in any industry confines the jurisdiction of the Commission to declare a contract void or to vary it within bounds that leave intact the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over other kinds of contractual obligations.

<tocase>Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/1.html</AustLII>
<text>7 A major legal and factual premise of the BoQ parties' case is that each of the OMB parties who are parties to an OMB Agreement should be classified as an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . That term is defined by s 4 of that Act but only in a way that declares that an "independent contractor" is not limited to a natural person. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for the purposes of this interlocutory application to reach a concluded view as to meaning of the term. It is enough to observe that, subject the declaration in the definition, the question of whether a party to a contract, corporate or individual, is or is not an "independent contractor" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act has been seemingly left by the Parliament to be determined having regard by analogy to principles of the common law developed in modern times by cases such as Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 207 CLR 21 and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16.

48 The BoQ parties' point is certainly not clear to demonstration. In the face of a statutory definition of "independent contractor" which provides that an "independent contractor" is not limited to a natural person, recourse to an Explanatory Memorandum which seeks to promote the notion that the Act is concerned with an independent contractor/ employee distinction may be nothing more than a distraction from giving attention to the language of the definition in the Act itself in the context in which it appears. If nothing else, and given that a corporation cannot be an employee at common law, the way that the definition of "independent contractor" is cast gives pause for thought about whether it might be possible to have a corporate contractor whom one would not conclude was an independent contactor, applying by analogy tests laid down in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd , supra and Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd , supra. I expressly refrain from reaching a concluded view on that subject at an interlocutory stage.</text>
