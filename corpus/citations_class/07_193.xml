<tocase>Karmot Auto Spares Pty Limited v Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 560 at 565</tocase>
<text>24 The Loan Account Statements on their face purport to be documents recording financial transactions, namely loans, involving Rural Finance. They are "records" in the sense that they are part of a repository of information in organised form which is accessible in the ordinary course of a business and for the purposes of that business: Karmot Auto Spares Pty Limited v Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 560 at 565. The Receivers found the documents amongst the business records of Rural Finance when they took control of those records. I find that they were part of Rural Finance's records within the meaning of s 69(1)(a)(i).

25 The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the "person" in question be identified. The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact. The policy behind the provision is clear enough. Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)), have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law's aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination. The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made.

26 Prior to the Evidence Act , all Australian jurisdictions had legislation based on provisions of the Evidence Act 1938 (Imp) which rendered admissible statements made in documents outside court where, inter alia, the document formed part of a continuous record. Examples were the Evidence Act 1898 (NSW) ss 14B-14C and the Evidence Act 1958 (Vic) s 5. Such legislation required the maker of the statement to be called as a witness, although that requirement could be dispensed with in certain circumstances, such as death or absence "beyond the seas". The present s 69 , however, says nothing about calling the maker of the statement as a witness. It is therefore hard to see why one should read into the section an obligation to identify the "person" where there is no need for that person to be called.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/303.html</AustLII>
<text>27 In Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 303 there was an issue as to whether a notice of a decision was sent by the Minister to the applicant by a certain date. One piece of evidence relied on by the Minister was a copy, produced from the departmental files, of a letter addressed to the applicant advising of refusal of the application and enclosing the reasons for that refusal. The copy letter bore a handwritten notation

 Hely J observed at [22] that the notation was made by a person unknown, apparently as a result of a communication with an unknown person at Australia Post. He inferred that somebody at Australia Post informed somebody at the Department on 20 March 2001 that the letter was in the delivery centre of Australia Post on that date. His Honour admitted the notation under s 69(2)(b) as being made in the course of the Department's business on the basis of information directly supplied by a person from Australia Post who might reasonably be supposed to have had knowledge of the asserted fact, namely that on 20 March an envelope containing the letter was in the delivery centre of Australia Post.

30 Senior counsel for the Commissioner referred to the detailed discussion of recent authorities by Austin J in Rich at [95]-[118]. However, that analysis rather focussed on the question of authentification, in the sense of provenance, and whether, as Bryson J held in National Australia Bank Ltd v Rusu [1999] NSWSC 539 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 309, authentification cannot be achieved solely by drawing inferences from the face of the document itself where there is no other evidence to indicate provenance. Whether that be correct (as Austin J points out, there has been subsequent criticism of such a view) there is adequate authentification here in the evidence of the Receiver who physically located the document among the business records of Rural Finance; see Evidence Act s 58.

37 Rural Finance Loans Spreadsheet . This document and the following one were compiled in November 1992 by employees of KPMG after the appointment of the Receivers. They are nevertheless records kept by Rural Finance for the purposes of ss 69 and 1035: Rich at [266]-[272]. The document records the payments in question as being due on 30 September and 30 December 1987 and paid on 2 October 1987 and 4 January 1988.

38 It was argued that the document was prepared for the purpose of conducting, or in contemplation of or in connection with, a "proceeding" and thus excluded from the operation of s 69 by virtue of subs (3). "Proceeding" is not defined in the Act . Presumably it means litigation. The identity of the person who compiled the document is not known. There is no evidence as to what he or she in fact contemplated; cf Lee in the Full Court at [27]. There is no reason to conclude that such persons contemplated litigation at the stage the entries were made. The more natural inference is that the document was prepared as a matter of routine to assist the Receivers in an understanding of the financial position of Rural Finance and to seek payment of amounts due. Whether or not litigation might ensue in respect of any particular debtor was a matter for the future.

39 In any case, the s 69(3) exclusion does not apply to documents admissible under s 1305.</text>

<text>66 By reason of the failure to pay the two $5000 instalments on time Mr Guest became legally liable for repayment of the full amount of the loan and interest thereon. The interest which accrued under the loan agreement during the relevant years was therefore "incurred" by him.

<tocase>Gair v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 29 ; (1944) 71 CLR 388</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1944/29.html</AustLII>
<text>68 As a matter of construction of the loan agreement, this argument fails at the outset. By cl 3A(i) the parties agreed: 
 
 
 "that the Loan is for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to periodic repayment, the balance of the Principal Sum (if any and any other monies outstanding) shall be paid by the Joint Venturer to the Lender on the 31 st March, 1992." 
 


 
 The Principal Sum is the sum of $55,000 and the provisions as to periodic repayment are the provisions for the payment of the two amounts of $5000 (cl 3B(i)) and the deductions from the sale of fruit proceeds (cl 3B(ii)). As to interest, cl 3A(ii) provides:
 
 
 
 "subject to clause 3A(iii) [which provides for a rate of 15% when payments are made within seven days of the due date] interest shall accrue at the rate of nineteen (19%) per centum on the balance of the Principal Sum from time to time outstanding such interest to be calculated annually in arrears on the 31 st March in each year of this Agreement." (19%) 
 
 
 
 Accordingly, the liability to pay interest does not cease if all or any part of the Principal Sum has not been repaid by 31 March 1992. The case is to be distinguished from Gair v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 29 ; (1944) 71 CLR 388 where the mortgage provided for the payment of interest for a period of one year, but there was no covenant to pay interest thereafter.

69 What was alleged to be owing by Mr Guest in the writ and the invoice of 14 March 2002 and admitted to be owing in the deed of settlement, was interest. There is no mention of damages. Nor in any of the authorities hereafter mentioned was it suggested that liabilities incurred after the term of the loan in question were for damages rather than interest.</text>

71 This issue, which also arises under the carrying on business limb, raises the question whether Mr Guest has shown there was a sufficient nexus between his incurring of interest liabilities in 1998 to 2001 and the blueberry growing business in which, following the appointment of Receivers, he ceased to have any involvement after 1991.</text>

In Placer the claimed deduction was for a payment in settlement of litigation in respect of defective goods supplied. In the other cases it was for interest on a business related loan.

73 That the gap in time may be considerable is demonstrated by the following table:
 Case Business ceased Deduction allowed 
 Placer 1981 1989
 Brown 1990 1994
 Jones 1993 1998
 R &amp; D 1990 1999
 
 In R &amp; D there is the qualification that the business in question, the leasing of an office building, was still carried on, although not by the taxpayer but by a mortgagee in possession.

77 In Brown the taxpayers borrowed money to fund the purchase of a delicatessen. They sold the business in 1990 but the proceeds were not sufficient to discharge the loan. They continued to pay interest until the loan was discharged in 1995. The Full Court (Lee, RD Nicholson and Merkel JJ) upheld the decision of the trial judge that there was a sufficient connection between the occasion for the payment of interest and the carrying on of the business. On the appeal, the Commissioner had argued that once the business had ceased the payment of the interest was not to be found in the carrying on of the business but in the voluntary decision of the partnership not to repay the loan and to continue to pay interest instalments (at [15]).

83 Their Honours referred to Brown and the passage quoted at [79] above. They observed (at [17]) that in the instant case the taxpayer had no free choice between continuing the loan and repaying it. They said: 
 
 
 "In our view the obiter dictum in Brown deals with the case of a true election where the borrower has the resources to pay out the loan but decides not to and rolls the loan over instead. In any event ... the loan in the present case was not a 'rollover' business loan facility, but one that would run for the agreed term unless the taxpayer decided to repay early."

84 In the present case there is no evidence one way or the other as to Mr Guest's personal financial resources in March 1992 or August 1996. Since the onus of showing that his assessments are excessive lies on him, if it is necessary for him to show that non-repayment of the loan was due to impecuniosity then his appeal must fail.

85 However, the authorities do not in my view establish that, as a matter of law, interest on a business-related loan ceases to have that character once an opportunity to repay the loan is not taken, the only exception being where the failure to repay is due to the taxpayer's impecuniosity.

88 There remains the argument based on sheer passage of time. There may come a time when the period between cessation of business and payment or incurring of interest is such that in all the circumstances the payment is "no longer sufficiently proximate to the activities of the business to be deductible": Brown at [25]. As senior counsel for the Commissioner accepted, the period cannot be precisely stated. The answer must depend, as was said in Brown at [25], upon commonsense or practical weighing of all the factors.

89 In itself the period of time in the present case is substantial, but it is not really disproportionate to the periods that have been considered not sufficient to destroy proximity in other cases; see [73] above. At the most, the period in this case might be said to be approaching the outer limits. Also there is the factor that from the point of view of the lender and its successors willingness to enforce the loan was never abandoned, either by the Receivers or Equus. It is not as though some commercial archaeologist came across a long forgotten loan and set about recovery.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jones (2002) ATC 4135</tocase>
<text>72 A line of cases supports the proposition that a loss or outgoing may be deductible even if it is incurred some years after the associated business, or the taxpayer's involvement in it, has ceased: Placer Pacific Management Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 31 ATR 253, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown (1999) 99 ATC 4600, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jones (2002) ATC 4135, and R &amp; D Holdings Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2006) ATC 4472. In Placer the claimed deduction was for a payment in settlement of litigation in respect of defective goods supplied. In the other cases it was for interest on a business related loan.

73 That the gap in time may be considerable is demonstrated by the following table:

 Placer 1981 1989
 Brown 1990 1994

 R &amp; D 1990 1999
 
 In R &amp; D there is the qualification that the business in question, the leasing of an office building, was still carried on, although not by the taxpayer but by a mortgagee in possession.

80 In Jones a husband and wife conducted a trucking business in partnership. They took out a loan with the ANZ Bank in 1990. In 1992 the husband died. In 1993 the business ceased. The wife recommenced full-time employment as a nurse using more than half her after tax income to repay the loan. In 1996 the wife refinanced the loan with another lender to obtain a lower interest rate. The Full Court (Beaumont, Finn and Sundberg JJ) upheld the wife's claim for deductions of interest for the years 1993-1998.

81 Their Honours (at [10]) rejected the Commissioner's argument that the taxpayer only became obliged to pay interest in the years in question because she chose not to repay the principal sum and that the "occasion" for the interest repayment was each periodic decision to keep the loan on foot. They did so for two reasons. First, the loan was for a fixed term and was not dependent on periodic decisions on the taxpayer's part to keep it alive. Secondly, she did not have the financial capacity to do so. Their Honours noted (at [11]) that "the borrowed funds and the interest on them were always referrable to the former business"</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Riverside Road Lodge Pty Ltd (in liq) (1990) 23 FCR 305</tocase>
<text>75 The concept of a break in the nexus was applied in Commissioner of Taxation v Riverside Road Lodge Pty Ltd (in liq) (1990) 23 FCR 305. In 1970 the taxpayer company borrowed money to acquire land and construct a motel. There were repayments and further borrowings. In 1979 the taxpayer transferred the property to the trustee of a unit trust, the beneficiaries of which were the shareholders in the taxpayer. The consideration for the transfer was the current value, payable on demand, interest free. The trustee then leased the property back to the taxpayer, which continued to conduct the motel business. The disputed deduction was for interest on pre-1979 loans incurred after the transfer.

76 The Full Court (Northrop, Wilcox and Hill JJ) observed (at 314) that the case was not one where the activities of the taxpayer in operating the motel ceased during any relevant year of income. However, in 1979, as a result of the sale and lease-back, the character of the activities of the taxpayer changed. Before, it was an owner/operator of a motel; afterwards it was an operator of a motel owned by others and of which it was only a tenant. The Full Court disagreed with the view of the trial judge that the 1979 change was not sufficient to change the relationship between the interest payments and the business activity. The interest outgoings ceased to be "relevant and incidental" to the business activities engaged in by the taxpayer after 1979. They had "no real connection at all with the business of running a rented motel" (at 315).

82 Their Honours (at [14]) observed that Riverside Road: 
 
 
 "...does not establish that a taxpayer who has a legal right to repay a business loan after the cessation of business can never thereafter deduct interest payable on the loan. All it decided is that, in the circumstances of that case, which involved a distinct change in business activity during the currency of the loan, interest continued to be deductible after the cessation of the business for which the loan was incurred because the taxpayer was contractually bound to pay interest until the loan was repaid."

86 Here the occasion of the borrowing from Rural Finance and the consequent interest liability was undoubtedly to be found in business operations directed towards the gaining or producing of assessable income. The cessation of the taxpayer's involvement in the business did not in itself retrospectively alter the occasion of the borrowing. Apart from cessation, there was no event which altered the taxpayer's relationship to the business, such as occurred in Riverside Road . In 1987 Mr Guest became obliged to pay interest on a business-related borrowing. The obligation arose from his entering into the loan agreement and failing to make the two $5000 repayments on time. In the tax years in question his liability for interest arose under the same obligation. He owed the interest in his capacity as borrower of the same loan to a successor in title of the original lender. Apart from the sheer passage of time argument, the interest liabilities had a "real connection" with Mr Guest's blueberry growing business.

87 The point may be illustrated by a hypothetical example. A taxpayer has a business- related loan. While the business is still operating, the term of the loan comes to an end. The taxpayer has the resources to repay the loan, but decides not to, perhaps because the interest rate is favourable, or perhaps he simply overlooks the matter. The interest would continue to be deductible. There seems no logical reason why a different result should occur in a situation where the business has ceased.

90 As often happens in such cases (see Riverside Road at 312), consideration of s 8-1(1)(a) and (b) tended to overlap. If, as I find to be the case, Mr Guest succeeds under (a) he does not need to establish the carrying on business element of (b). Nevertheless, I find that this element has been satisfied.

91 It is true that there is no evidence that Mr Guest ever visited the blueberry farm or did anything to participate in the business other than sign documents, pay some money, return income and claim deductions.</text>

<tocase>Steele v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 197 CLR 449</tocase>
<text>78 Their Honours reviewed the case law, and in particular the decision of the High Court in Steele v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 197 CLR 449. They applied (at [20]) the statement of the High Court, adopting what was said by Lockhart J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd (1979) 79 ATC 4279 at 4283, that a taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction after a business has ceased, provided the occasion of a business outgoing is to be found in the business operations directed towards the gaining or production of assessable income generally. However, cessation of business may be of factual importance. Their Honours (at [24]) concluded that the trial judge was correct in determining that the occasion for the loss or outgoing in question was the payment of interest which the taxpayers were obliged (their Honour's emphasis) to pay under the loan contract.</text>

<text>78 Their Honours reviewed the case law, and in particular the decision of the High Court in Steele v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 197 CLR 449. They applied (at [20]) the statement of the High Court, adopting what was said by Lockhart J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd (1979) 79 ATC 4279 at 4283, that a taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction after a business has ceased, provided the occasion of a business outgoing is to be found in the business operations directed towards the gaining or production of assessable income generally. However, cessation of business may be of factual importance. Their Honours (at [24]) concluded that the trial judge was correct in determining that the occasion for the loss or outgoing in question was the payment of interest which the taxpayers were obliged (their Honour's emphasis) to pay under the loan contract.</text>

<text>92 This does not mean, however, that Mr Guest was not carrying on business. He did so by engaging his agent Johnson Farm Management for that purpose: qui facit per alium facit per se ; see also Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211 at [46] - [61] , the facts of which are quite similar to the present case. Mr Guest's involvement in the blueberry growing at Corindi was comparable to that of English absentee landlords of Irish estates in the nineteenth century. They conducted their business through the medium of agents such as Captain Hugh Boycott, who gave his name to the language.

93 The blueberry project involved the motive of profit, albeit not immediate, repetition of activities, systematic organisation, and the investment by Mr Guest and the other three individuals of significant amounts. This was not a hobby.

94 Since there will need to be some adjustment to the amounts (see [63] above), I direct counsel to bring in minutes of proposed orders to give effect to these reasons. 


 I certify that the preceding ninety-four (94) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey .
