<tocase>Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629</tocase>
<text>8 I have carefully reviewed the Advertising Material several times and have sought to assess the likely effect of each on potential customers. In reviewing the Advertising Material I had at the forefront the caution from Lindgren J in Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [47] regarding television advertising. Of course, similar caution must be adopted when reviewing the Advertising Material.

9 I accept that the following Representations were conveyed in the following Advertising Material:
 Advertising Material Episode Representations Conveyed The Age First to Sixth Advertisements 23 June 2007, 7, 14, 28 July 2007 4 and 11 August 2007 7 Seat Representation Price Representation 7 Seat Price Representation The Age Seventh Advertisement (18 August 2007) 7 Seat Representation 7 Seat Price Representation Sydney Morning Herald Eighth Advertisement (30 June 1 July 2007) 7 Seat Representation Price Representation 7 Seat Price Representation Sydney Morning Herald Ninth and Tenth Advertisements (7-8 July 2007 and 21-22 July 2007) 7 Seat Series Representation Audi Website 7 Seat Series Representation 2007 Specifications Brochure August 2007 7 Seat Series Representation 2006 Specifications Brochure August 2006 7 Seat Series Representation

10 Next, the ACCC submits that the Representations were false, misleading or deceptive on the basis that:
 
 
 (1) the Audi Q7 Series motor vehicles including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE have 5 seats as a standard feature;
 (2) 7 seats is an option available in the Audi Q7 Series motor vehicles including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE;
 (3) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is not available for purchase as a 7 seat vehicle at or from $79,900; 
 
 
 (4) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is not available for purchase at or from $79,900; 
 
 
 (5) there is a fee or charge to be paid in addition to the price of $79,900 to purchase an Audi Q7 3.6 SE vehicle for mandatory components including dealer delivery and statutory charges; and
 (6) there is a fee or charge to be paid in addition to the price of $79,900 for the 2 optional extra seats (in order to have 7 seats).</text>
