<text>The power of the Court to strike out a claim for determination of native title should be exercised cautiously; see McKenzie v South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214; [2005] FCA 22 at [26], per Finn J and see also Lawson v NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2007] FCA 8 at [22] per Stone J.

In Lawson , Stone J dismissed an application for compensation in circumstances where there was no reasonable prospect of evidence being adduced to advance the claim. Justice Kiefel took a similar approach in Beattie on behalf of Western Wakka Wakka Peoples v Queensland [2007] FCA 596 at [23]. Her Honour referred to a lack of response to the orders of the Court and the lack of any purpose served by the continuation of the proceeding.</text>
