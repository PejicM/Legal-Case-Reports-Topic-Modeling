<tocase>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 45 ; (1993) 40 FCR 381</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/45.html</AustLII>
<text>15 The absurdity is said to result in invalidity because no reasonable person could have devised the 2006 transitional provision; it is a fantastic and capricious law. Particular reliance was placed on the observations of Lockhart J as a member of the Full Court in Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 45 ; (1993) 40 FCR 381 ( Austral Fisheries ) at 382:
 Delegated legislation is not invalid on the ground of unreasonableness in the sense that the courts may form a different view as to what is reasonable. Unreasonableness in this branch of the law means unreasonable in the sense that "a merely fantastic and capricious by-law, such as reasonable men could not make in good faith" is bad, because delegated legislation of this kind could not be regarded as an exercise of the power conferred upon the subordinate legislative body making the delegated legislation .... 
At 401 the other members of the Full Court (Beaumont and Hill JJ) endorsed the primary judge's holding that the provisions under attack were "capricious and irrational, such that no reasonable person could ever have devised" them.

16 The first three steps at [14] are not in dispute. The conclusion in the last step is, and in my view does not follow from those that precede it. Subclause (2) applies only if the assessment mentioned in subclause (1) is carried out and has a particular character. It thus has no operation if subclause (1) does not apply. The 2006 transitional provision does not purport to give subclause (2) any operation beyond the class of visa applications covered by (the existing) subclause (1), namely those made on or after 1 July 2005. A visa application lodged before 1 July 2005 remains unaffected by any part of clause 880.230.

25 The present case is quite unlike Austral Fisheries [1993] FCA 45 ; 40 FCR 381 , where the formula for the allocation of quotas was based on a statistical fallacy which operated to produce such a capricious and irrational result that no reasonable person could have devised it. It is also unlike Li [1999] FCA 1147 ; 94 FCR 219 , where the delegated legislation was inconsistent with the Act itself. That is not the case here. Indeed, little assistance is to be derived from other cases on capriciousness and irrationality. Each depends on its own facts. For the reasons I have sought to express, I do not regard the result in the present case as having either of those characteristics.</text>

<text>17 This construction of the provisions accords with the ordinary meaning of the words and produces a sensible result. It is thus to be preferred to that propounded by the appellant, which would produce what she describes as an absurdity, namely that subclause (2) would purport to apply in some cases where it has no work to do for want of any assessment having been required by subclause (1). See, for example, Public Transport Commission (NSW) v J Murray-Moore (NSW) Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 28 ; (1975) 132 CLR 336 at 350 and Widgee Shire Council v Bonney [1907] HCA 11 ; (1907) 4 CLR 977 at 983.</text>

<tocase>Li v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1147 ; (1999) 94 FCR 219</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1147.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In this connection the appellant relied on the obiter observations of Gyles J in Li v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1147 ; (1999) 94 FCR 219 ( Li ). There in question was a regulation deeming documents dispatched in a particular way to have been received at a particular time. At [46] to [47] Gyles J said:
 [T]he description of the legislation in Austral Fisheries ... is apt to describe the result of applying subregs (1)(a) and (2) of reg 5.03. The result is not simply the possibility of some illogical or strange result depending upon the circumstances. It is the certainty of an absurd result if the notification is posted on the seventh day, as the regulation expressly contemplates. The inevitable result of that state of facts is that the applicant will simply not receive the prescribed number of days in which to make an application for review as required by s 347(1) and reg 4.10. Thus, another way of analysing the matter is to say that the delegated legislation is inconsistent with the legislation, and in particular with s 347(1). ... I cannot accept that in the present context Parliament would intend that delegated legislation may validly contemplate the certainty that the Minister may correctly follow its provisions, yet the applicant will not receive the benefit of the prescribed statutory period of notice.

25 The present case is quite unlike Austral Fisheries [1993] FCA 45 ; 40 FCR 381 , where the formula for the allocation of quotas was based on a statistical fallacy which operated to produce such a capricious and irrational result that no reasonable person could have devised it.

<text>23 Gyles J's obiter observations were approved by two members of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 at [49] , where their Honours noted that reg 5.03 could produce the absurd result that the document, if sent on the seventh day after its date, was to be taken to have been received before that could possibly be the case.</text>

<tocase>City of Brunswick v Stewart [1941] HCA 7 ; (1941) 65 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1941/7.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The Minister accepts that the differential results that could arise between two visa applicants whose positions are otherwise the same depending on the luck of the draw is unfortunate. However, he says that this is the inevitable result where the regulation maker wishes promptly to close a loophole in the existing criteria, and that scope for debate as to the consequences of such a measure does not mean that it lacks a rational foundation. Support for this view, which I accept, is provided by the distinction drawn by Starke J in City of Brunswick v Stewart [1941] HCA 7 ; (1941) 65 CLR 88 at 98 - "it is one thing to say that the provision is drastic, and another to affirm that it is so capricious and oppressive that no reasonable mind can justify it".</text>

<tocase>Health Insurance Commission v Peverill [1994] HCA 8 ; (1994) 179 CLR 226</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/8.html</AustLII>
<text>32 It was common ground that when the appellant paid the visa application fee there was no acquisition of property within s 51(xxxi). She paid the fee voluntarily. There was no compulsory acquisition, expropriation or requisition. See Health Insurance Commission v Peverill [1994] HCA 8 ; (1994) 179 CLR 226 at 235, 299 ( Peverill ) and Smith v ANL Ltd [2000] HCA 58 ; (2000) 204 CLR 493 at [128] per Hayne J, with whom McHugh J agreed.

35 In order for the voluntarily paid fee to become an expropriated asset, the challenged provisions must have defeated some right that was acquired by the appellant when she entered into the transaction constituted by the visa application accompanied by the fee. What she thereby obtained was the right to have her application considered and determined according to law. That right is enforceable by public law remedies such as mandamus. It is not a right to a particular outcome. The right to have an application determined according to law is always subject to the power of Parliament and its delegates to change the law. Accordingly there is no right to have an application considered against criteria that exist at the time the application is made. In Peverill 179 CLR at 261, McHugh J quoted with approval the observation of Pitney J in New York Central RR Co v White (1917) 243 US 188 at 198 that "No person has a vested interest in any rule of law entitling him to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit".</text>

<tocase>Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (1994) 179 CLR 155</tocase>
<text>33 The appellant claims that the making of clause 880.230(2) and the 2006 transitional provision changed the character of the fee. It took away any chance of the appellant obtaining the visa, and the value of her access to the visa determination process, for which she had paid the fee, was entirely removed. The amendment, combined with the transitional provision and s 46(1)(ba), turned the payment of the fee into an ex post facto expropriation. Those provisions became laws "with respect to" the acquisition of property. Section 46(1) prescribes the requirements for a "valid visa" for the purposes of other provisions such as s 65. See [27]. One such requirement (par (ba)) is that any visa application charge required by the regulations to be paid at the time of application has been paid. The appellant relied on Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (1994) 179 CLR 155 (Mutual Pools ) at 188 as authority that a law can have more than one character. She claimed that there was no reason why a law cannot have different characters in different circumstances. It was said that when the Commonwealth obtains a fee for the provision of a benefit, and later legislation takes away the value of that benefit (in the sense of any prospect of obtaining it), the amount paid is acquired by the Commonwealth other than on just terms.

34 The central question is whether there has been an acquisition of property belonging to the appellant. That arises for decision before one gets to the question canvassed in cases such as Mutual Pools 179 CLR 155 , which is whether the law has the constitutional character of a law with respect to the acquisition of property.</text>
