<tocase>Reid v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1479</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1479.html</AustLII>
<text>15 I recently have had the need to outline the principles applicable to a matter such as this: see Reid v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1479 at [23] - [30] . The following, with some addition, is drawn from what I there said.

16 An application for a determination of native title under s 13(1)(a) of the Native Title Act can be brought in accordance with s 61(1) by (for present purposes):
 
 "A person or persons authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed, provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group; ... 
 
 
 
 
 Note 1: The person or persons will be the applicant: see subsection (2) of this section. 
 Note 2: Section 251B states what it means for a person or persons to be authorised by all the persons in the native title claim group."

<tocase>Harrington-Smith v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/31.html</AustLII>
<text>17 As Lindgren J commented in Harrington-Smith v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 at [72] :
 
 "The expression 'native title claim group' is defined in s 253 to mean, relevantly, the native title claim group mentioned in this passage. The expression is commonly and understandably used to refer to the group on whose behalf a native title determination application claimant application is made. Indeed, Form 1, prescribed by para 5(1)(a) of the Native Title (Federal Court) Regulations 1998 (Cth), uses the expression in that sense, treating 'claimants' and members of the 'native title claim group' as synonymous. But there is no escaping the fact that the 'native title claim group', all of whose members are required by s 61(1) to authorise the applicant to apply, is a group constituted by all the actual holders, according to their traditional laws and customs, of the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed."

18 I would note in passing that the indispensable nexus between traditional laws and customs and claimed native title rights and interests is made plain in s 223(1) of the Act which recognises "communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples" in relation to land where "the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples" (emphasis added).

19 Section 61(4) provides that where a native title application is one authorised by a claim group the application must (a) name the persons constituting the group or (b) otherwise describe the persons sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons.

23 I have noted above the tie between group membership and authorisation. Of the significance of authorisation I need do no more than gratefully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in Harrington-Smith (No 9) at [1171]-[1172]:
 
 "'Proper authorisation is the foundation for the institution and maintenance of a native title claimant application under s 61 of the new Act': Perry and Lloyd , Australian Native Title Law (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2003) at [3.140] p 439. Authorisation is 'fundamental to the legitimacy of native title determination applications', and is 'not a condition to be met by formulaic statements in or in support of applications': Strickland at 259-260.
 
 Where the authorisation requirement of s 61(1) is not complied with, the non-compliance is fatal to the success of the application: Moran v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 at [48] ; Strickland at [56]-[57] (approved in WA v Strickland at [77]-[78]); Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169 at [10] ; Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 (FCA) at [11]; De Rose FCA/O'Loughlin J at [933]. Authorisation must be by all the persons who constitute the native title claim group in respect of the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed: Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [30] ; Dieri People v South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 at [55] ( 'Dieri People' ); Tilmouth v Northern Territory [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240."</text>

<text>21 It is well-accepted that "[t]he proper identification of the native title claim group is the central or focal issue of a native title determination application": Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at [35] . It is that group which provides the authorisation under s 251B: see Harrington-Smith (No 9) , at [1186] ff. It is in that group's favour that a determination, if successful, is made: ibid; see also Colbung v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 774.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1589.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The requirements that the group be constituted by all the actual native title holders and that a determination, if successful, is to be made in their favour carry with them two consequences. The first is that a subset or part of what truly constitutes a native title group cannot itself be a claimant group under s 61(1): Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61] ; although in some, though by no means all, instances, there may be good reason for hesitation in readily concluding that an alleged group is only a sub-group or part of a group for s 84C purposes: see McKenzie v State of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at [41]. However, where a sub-group of a community sharing traditional laws and customs alone possesses rights and interests in a particular area, that sub-group may itself constitute a native title claim group: see Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] .

<tocase>McKenzie v State of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214</tocase>
<text>22 The requirements that the group be constituted by all the actual native title holders and that a determination, if successful, is to be made in their favour carry with them two consequences. The first is that a subset or part of what truly constitutes a native title group cannot itself be a claimant group under s 61(1): Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61] ; although in some, though by no means all, instances, there may be good reason for hesitation in readily concluding that an alleged group is only a sub-group or part of a group for s 84C purposes: see McKenzie v State of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at [41]. However, where a sub-group of a community sharing traditional laws and customs alone possesses rights and interests in a particular area, that sub-group may itself constitute a native title claim group: see Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] .

24 Finally I should note that s 84C(1) provides that, if an application does not comply with s 61, s 61A or s 62, a party to the proceedings may at any time apply to this Court to strike it out. All I need observe here is that the court's power should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable upon the "version of the evidence" favourable to the respondent to the strike out: McKenzie , at [26]; Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77.

33 For my own part I consider the trust-like claim gives some reason for pause. The application and the accompanying evidence when considered most favourably to Mr Kite: see McKenzie at [26]; does suggest (subject to what is later said) that there is a basis for asserting the claim group members were, in accordance with traditional law and custom, authorised to make the claim (i.e. as Nguraritjas); that they were entitled to speak for the country; and that they had particular responsibilities in relation to the land claim. But the doubt it engenders is that these matters have had some part to play in contriving the claim group itself. That doubt is exaggerated by the not altogether satisfactory explanation given of the "rights" of the wider community of descendants of Bill Kite to enjoy or to have the benefits of the native title rights and interests claimed. Nonetheless, it is said on Mr Kite's behalf that the division between holding the claimed rights and interests on the one hand, and having the benefit or enjoyment of them on the other is a factual proposition that is not to be tested on the present motion.

34 In the end I consider that I am obliged to give Mr Kite the benefit of the doubts I have. I would, however, observe this much. I am not prepared to assume that the particular traditional laws and customs of an Aboriginal group cannot produce the type of internal relationship within a community such as is advanced in this claim. Nonetheless, I have some concern that in this matter the claim may well owe more to concepts drawn from common law conceptions of property than from traditional laws and customs. I refer in particular to the apparent equation here of the idea of being a "holder" of native title rights and interests with that of being the "owner" of those rights and interests.

35 The second two matters to which I need refer relate to the actual composition of the claim group itself and to the basis of its membership. I have foreshadowed both of these matters. The first relates to the members' relationship to Bill Kite; the second, to Adam Tunkin's membership of the group.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/760.html</AustLII>
<text>43 The vices in the membership of the claim group carry over into the alleged authorisation of Mr Kite to bring the claim itself. I need say no more about this, other than to observe that this particular claim group is itself probably best described as self-identifying and self-authorising and is objectionable for those reasons: see Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760 at [45] . The process of authorisation described in the affidavit accompanying the Form 1 suggests as much.

44 The State also raised subsidiary issues of non-compliance with procedural requirements imposed by s 61A and s 62. Given my conclusion as to the fate of the application itself, it is unnecessary that I deal with these.

45 I will order that the native title determination application (SAD 130 of 2007) be struck out under s 84C of the Native Title Act .

 I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.
