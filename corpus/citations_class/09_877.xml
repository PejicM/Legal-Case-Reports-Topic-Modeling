<tocase>Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 , 197 CLR 510</tocase>

<text>Indeed, it would be curious if any contrary conclusion were to be reached. It is for a claimant to advance whatever evidence or arguments he wishes to advance in support of a claim that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason; it is then for the Tribunal to decide whether the claim is made out: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 at [187] , 197 CLR 510 at 576 per Gummow and Hayne JJ. It would be a curious result (and an unacceptable result) if a claimant could unsuccessfully advance some materials and thereafter have an entitlement, perhaps a repeated entitlement, to supplement the original material until he may ultimately prevail. The unacceptability of such a course is only compounded by a claimant shunning an invitation to attend and to participate in a hearing so that the material originally provided could then be discussed.

The passage in the Tribunal's " Findings and Reasons " which is the subject of the final Ground of Appeal , together with the " Conclusions " thereafter expressed, provide as follows: 
 [26] ... I am unable to be satisfied on the evidence before me that, if the applicant returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, there is a real chance that he will be involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted (whether by the Awami League leader and his people, the Awami League more generally, the caretaker government or the army) for reasons of his real or imputed political opinion or for any other Convention reason. 
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS 

 
 [27] I am unable to be satisfied on the evidence before me that the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason if he returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. It follows that I am not satisfied that the applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. Consequently the applicant does not satisfy the criterion set out in paragraph 36(2)(a) of the Act for a protection visa.

By reference to the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate, it is understood that " the applicant contended that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction by giving him a guarantee that he would not have any real chance of persecution ...". But, as correctly observed by the Federal Magistrate, no such " guarantee " was given. The conclusion of the Tribunal was that it was " unable to be satisfied on the evidence " that the now Appellant would be " involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted ... ".</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>Second, if the Ground is intended to convey that the Tribunal should have placed greater weight upon the claims being advanced, notwithstanding the fact that the now Appellant elected not to appear before the Tribunal, the weight to be given to the evidence advanced is a matter for the Tribunal &#8212; and not a matter for the Federal Magistrate or this Court on appeal: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 291 to 292 per Kirby J.

This Ground is without substance.

The second Ground of Appeal , again construed as a contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that there had been a failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is also to be rejected.</text>

<tocase>Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCAFC 21</tocase>
<text>The Notice of Appeal , however, fails to identify any ground upon which it is said that the Federal Magistrate has erred. The Notice of Appeal and the Appellant's written Outline of Submissions are both directed to errors said to have been made by the Tribunal. But it is not the task of this Court on appeal to again review the decision of the Tribunal. In Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCAFC 210 Finn, Marshall and Goldberg JJ correctly observed: 
 [10] ... that much of the appellant's submissions were directed to the proposition that the Tribunal had made errors in the way it had considered the evidence and issues before it. Although this occurred under the rubric of a consideration of the primary judge's reasons it was of little assistance in understanding why it was said that the primary judge fell into error. The Court wishes to emphasise that an appeal to the Full Court in a refugee matter should not be taken as an occasion to re-consider the Tribunal's reasons as distinct from considering the primary judge's reasons.

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , 96 ALD 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The Tribunal proceeded to resolve the claim upon the basis of the material provided to it by the now Appellant. In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , 96 ALD 1 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ concluded: 
 [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [[2004] FCAFC 123 [2004] FCAFC 123 ; , 206 ALR 471] that the word "information": 

 
... does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.
 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself. 

 
The concept of " information ", as that term is used in s 424A , thus does not extend to the " subjective appraisals " of the Tribunal in its consideration of such materials as are placed before it by a claimant: see s 424A(3)(b). Nor does it extend to " doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence ". Decisions of this Court have obviously adopted and applied these conclusions: e.g. SZLPF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1692 at [8] ; Tran v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1826 at [26] , 105 ALD 555 at 563; SZLKY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1755 at [30] ; SZLSM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 537 at [31] .</text>

<text>Moreover, in circumstances where a claimant fails to attend at a hearing before the Tribunal &#8212; as in the present proceeding &#8212; and where the Tribunal cannot reach the requisite state of satisfaction upon the materials before it, s 424A is of limited operation. In SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 Allsop J thus stated: 
 [29] ... here, the reason for the decision is plain. The Tribunal, having read all the material and having evaluated its content and weight, was unable to reach a specified mental state. It was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear because of subjectively perceived inadequacies in the information. The reason for the decision was simply (and no more than) the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information, in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited. It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision. It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason.

<text>An application for review was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 18 September 2008. An amended application was filed on 19 February 2009. That Court dismissed the application on 11 May 2009: SZMSZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 475.

The Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court on 1 June 2009 setting forth the following purported Grounds of Appeal (without alteration): 
 1. 1. The Refugee Review Tribunal failed to exercise its duty under the Migration Act that the Tribunal did not put any weight to my political involvement with the BNP and subsequently being persecuted. 
 2. The Refugee Review Tribunal said in its decision that many questions were unanswered as I did not attend at the hearing. However the Tribunal did not send me any notice under section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 to provide the unclear matter in details.
 3. The Refugee Review Tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction by making the comment that "if the applicant returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, there is a real chance that he will be involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted (......) for reasons of his real or imputed political opinion or for nay other Convention reason. 

 
These were the same grounds upon which reliance was placed before the Federal Magistrate. In support of the Appeal , the Appellant also filed an Outline of Submissions &#8212; as did the Respondent Minister.</text>
