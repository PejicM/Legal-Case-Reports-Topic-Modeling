<tocase>O'Reilly v Alderson [1849] EngR 680 ; (1849) 8 Hare 101 (68 ER 289)</tocase>
<text>The correct analysis seems to be that while MCA is in liquidation, it is disqualified from performing its duties and exercising its powers under the Unit Trust Deed, but continues to hold the property of the Trust upon a constructive trust by the operation of general law principles. It is an interesting question what the terms of the constructive trust are. It may be that MCA simply holds the property upon a passive constructive trust for these unit holders in equal shares. It may also be that upon termination of the winding up, MCA again assumes the role of trustee under the express terms of the Unit Trust Deed: cf O'Reilly v Alderson [1849] EngR 680 ; (1849) 8 Hare 101 (68 ER 289).

I am not called upon to decide these questions. In one way or another, it is clear that MCA will resume its position as trustee under the express terms of the Unit Trust Deed. Clause 11.4.3 of that Deed provides that with the unanimous consent of the unit holders in writing or by special resolution of the unit holders in general meeting, the unit holders are entitled to appoint a trustee in place of any trustee who is disqualified. It would not be in the interests of any of the unit holders to obstruct the passing of such a resolution if it should be thought necessary. Moreover, RSW and MMI have paid SC the purchase price for its units, and could compel SC to join with them in reappointing MCA as trustee, if this should be thought necessary in order to enable the unit transfers to be registered.

It was for the above reasons that I was satisfied that MCA was solvent and that I ordered the winding up should be terminated.
 I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.
