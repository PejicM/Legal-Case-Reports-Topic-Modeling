<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1276.html</AustLII>
<text>97 A different approach was that of Emmett J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276. His Honour there set forth as follows his understanding as to the effect of s 51A(2):
 [46] Another question concerning the effect of s51A(2) is whether the provision does no more than require a corporation to go into evidence. That is to say, it does not ultimately reverse the onus but simply provides that the deeming takes effect unless the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary. Once such evidence is adduced, it is for the Court to make a judgment, on the balance of probabilities, having regard to all the evidence, as to whether the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representation. If an applicant elects to adduce no evidence as to that question, then the only evidence before the Court would be that adduced by the corporation. Whether that is adequate to establish that the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representations is a matter for the Court. However, once the corporation has adduced some evidence, there is no deeming arising from s51A(2).

98 More recently, in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230 the Full Court revisited the construction of s 51A(2). Emmett J, one of the members of the Full Court, there observed:
 [44] Under s 51A(1) of the Trade Practices Act , a representation is to be taken to be misleading if it is a representation with respect to any future matter and the maker of the representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation. Under s 51A(2) , the maker of the representation with respect to any future matter is to be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation unless it adduces evidence to the contrary. However, if evidence is adduced by a representor to the effect that the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation, the deeming provision will not operate. Where the representor adduces such evidence, it is then a matter for the Court to determine, on the balance of probabilities in the ordinary way, whether or not the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation. 
This is understood to be the same approach that His Honour had previously expressed. In McGrath Allsop J also referred to the views previously expressed by Emmett J in Universal Sports and continued:
 [192] If evidence is adduced by the representor that is said to be evidence to the contrary, it will be for the Court to determine whether it is to the contrary in the sense just discussed. If it is, the deeming provision will cease to operate. That was the view of Emmett J, as understood by Keane JA [Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 199]. That is my view. That was not, however, an expression of the view that the legal or persuasive onus has been changed by s 51A(2) , as some of the judgments in the "trend of established authority" referred to by Keane JA have stated. For instance, if evidence "to the contrary" is adduced by the representor, and if the representee itself adduces evidence tending to the lack of reasonable grounds, the matter might be equally poised. In such a case, there has been evidence "to the contrary" adduced by the representee, thereby eliminating the operation of the deeming provision, and, on the totality of the evidence, the proof of the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of the grounds is evenly balanced. Section 51A(2) does not, in my view, mean that in those circumstances the representor has not met an onus. The section does not cast the legal or persuasive onus, in such a case, on the representor. Its terms do not say so. The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so. Keane JA, despite his reference to the "trend of established [first instance] authority", does not say so. In my respectful view, to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group (1999) ATPR 41-704 ; Blacker [2000] FCA 681 ; Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 ; Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 and Emerald Ocean [2006] ATPR 42-096 say, or may be taken as saying, that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s 51A(2) , they are wrong. None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett J also agreed with Allsop J as to the operation of s 51A(2): [2008] FCA 2 at [6] , 165 FCR at 233 4. The third member of the Full Court, Stone J, considered that the issues thrown up by s 51A(2) were best left to be resolved by a Full Court where there had been full argument and where the outcome depended on the view taken of the section: [2008] FCAFC 2 at [76] , 165 FCR at 247 8.</text>

<text>134 For a term to be implied into a contract, it is not sufficient that the implication of such a term would be reasonable in all of the circumstances. The requirements to be satisfied have conveniently been summarised for present purposes by the Privy Council in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v President, Councillors and Ratepayers of the Shire of Hastings [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266. The Privy Council there concluded at 283:
 ... for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that "it goes without saying"; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract. 
A term that the SLP 1100 would be " fit for purpose ", it is considered, satisfies these requirements. See also: Codelfa Construction Pty Limited v State Rail Authority of NSW [1982] HCA 24 ; (1981) 149 CLR 337 at 347 per Mason J.</text>

<text>123 It has not been suggested that the Applicants were " careless " in relying upon any of the representations of the Respondents. Even carelessness or negligence on the part of an applicant, it may be noted, will not deny relief -- provided the carelessness has not been such as to destroy the causal connection between the contravening conduct and the loss or damage suffered: Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 at [13] , [2001] HCA 52 ; 206 CLR 459 at 468 9. Gleeson CJ there observed:
 [13] It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly, or will have been otherwise at fault, in responding to the inducement. The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute. Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s 82 unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage. ... [14] For there to be the necessary causal relationship between a contravention of s 52, and loss or damage, so as to satisfy the requirements of s 82(1), it is not essential that the contravention be the sole cause of the loss or damage. ... 
The present case is not a case of carelessness or negligence. In the present proceeding, the Applicants acted at all material times prudently. They retained the services of an experienced person (Mr Mellor), made their own inquiries, and carefully considered the options available. The present case is one in which representations were made by Mr Wieland for the very purpose of inducing or encouraging the purchase of his machine. Not only is there an inference available that those statements were instrumental in the execution of the contracts (cf Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 85 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236 per Wilson J; Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 95 at [41] , [2008] NSWCA 95 ; 66 ACSR 359 at 370), the fact is that those statements have been proven to have played a large part in the decision to acquire the SLP 1100.</text>

A corporation's state of mind is immaterial in making out a case of misleading or deceptive conduct. In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 the Full Court relevantly observed:
 If a corporation is alleged to have contravened s 52(1) by making a statement of past or present fact, the corporation's state of mind is immaterial unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind. Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false.

94 Section 51A is a section which facilitates proof. But it is not a section which provides for an independent cause of action separate from s 52 or other sections of Part V of the 1974 Act: Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [96] per Collier J.

<tocase>Como Investments Pty Ltd v Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-550</tocase>
<text>116 The inquiry required by s 82 is not an inquiry into cause and effect in mathematical or philosophical terms, but is rather an inquiry into that conduct which influences action taken: Como Investments Pty Ltd v Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-550. Burchett, Ryan and Nicholson JJ there concluded:
 The law does not consider cause and effect in mathematical or in philosophical terms. The law looks at what influences the actions of the parties. Acknowledging that people are often swayed by several considerations, influencing them to varying extents, the law attributes causality to a single one of those considerations, provided it had some substantial rather than negligible effect. As Brennan J said in San Sebastian Pty Ltd v Minister administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 [1986] HCA 68 ; (1986) 162 CLR 340 at 366: 
 
 "The representation must be a real inducement or one of the real inducements to engage in the conduct which occasions the loss" 
 
 Where a representation is relevant to the decision in question, and in its nature persuasive to induce the making of that decision, it accords with legal notions of causation to hold that it has a causative effect. And where a respondent, who may be taken to know his own business, has thought it was in his interests to misrepresent the situation in a particular respect, the Court may infer that the misrepresentation was persuasive. These inferences arise from the making of the respondent doing the thing it was calculated to induce him to do. All this is a matter of common sense. It has also been stated in the authorities. In Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 85 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236 Wilson J said: "If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation." His Honour went on to say that the "inference may be rebutted", but this is to imply that in the absence of rebuttal the conclusion should stand. ...</text>

Section 75B does not require that a person knew he was participating in a contravention of the Act; what is required is actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666 70 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ; Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 at [40] per Finn J; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [267] [280]. There may be some circumstances where knowledge may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances: cf Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions [1988] HCA 57 at [11] , [1988] HCA 57 ; 82 ALR 217 at 219 20.</text>

<text>132 Reliance upon the skill of Wieland Equipment in supplying rock crushers may not have been the only cause of the agreement being signed, but reliance was in fact placed upon the skill and judgment of Mr Wieland: cf Gibbett v Forwood Products Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 290 at [95] per Mansfield J.

133 After the conclusion of the evidence, and in particular the cross-examination of Mr Wieland, it was difficult to see how a term could not be implied to the effect that the SLP 1100 would be fit for the purpose (generally stated) of crushing rock in Indonesia. Especially is this the case where Mr Wieland regarded it as " so obvious that [it] went without saying " that " the bargain between the parties " was that he was " going to solve the problem by providing ... a brand new SLP 1100 ". It was " fundamental to that bargain " that the " machine ... was going to be able to be used for the quarry operation at Surabaya " and that " it would be able to be used effectively for that purpose ". It was to be " a top quality machine ". Such matters, Mr Wieland accepted, were " plainly obvious, plain as a pikestaff ".</text>

<text>84 Conduct is " likely to mislead or deceive " if there is a " real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent ": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ (applying Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 346 per Deane J; Sheen v Fields Pty Ltd (1984) 58 ALJR 93) ; Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [97] . A corporation's state of mind is immaterial in making out a case of misleading or deceptive conduct. In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 the Full Court relevantly observed:
 If a corporation is alleged to have contravened s 52(1) by making a statement of past or present fact, the corporation's state of mind is immaterial unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind. Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false.

96 One view has been that s 51A(2) casts a burden of proof upon those making a representation as to a future matter to show that there were reasonable grounds for making it: Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543. Hill J there observed (at 552):
 The section is but an interpretation section; it does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct. The relevant cause of action is to be found in s 82(1) of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s 52 of the Act. What s 51A does, in a practical sense, in cases where it applies, is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing. In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis (1993) 113 ALR 285 ; ATPR (Digest) 46 103, s 51A is "designed to facilitate proof" (at ALR 294; ATPR 53,450). Representation as to future facts may, of course, constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within s 52 of the Act, irrespective of the operation of s 51A. However, without the intervention of s 51A the burden would remain upon the applicant to show that the representation, in whatever form it took, was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. In the ordinary case where a representation as to future conduct or events is alleged to have been made, that means that the burden would be upon the applicant to show not merely that the conduct or event has not come to pass but also that at the time the representation was made the respondent did not believe that the conduct or event would come to pass or that there was no basis for a belief that the conduct or event would come to pass: James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347 ; Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88; [1984] FCA 180 ; 55 ALR 25. It will be readily apparent that a representation as to future conduct or a future event will generally imply (and sometimes explicitly state) that the maker of the representation was of a particular state of mind as to the future conduct or event as at the time the representation was made. ...

<text>116 The inquiry required by s 82 is not an inquiry into cause and effect in mathematical or philosophical terms, but is rather an inquiry into that conduct which influences action taken: Como Investments Pty Ltd v Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-550. Burchett, Ryan and Nicholson JJ there concluded:
 The law does not consider cause and effect in mathematical or in philosophical terms. The law looks at what influences the actions of the parties. Acknowledging that people are often swayed by several considerations, influencing them to varying extents, the law attributes causality to a single one of those considerations, provided it had some substantial rather than negligible effect. As Brennan J said in San Sebastian Pty Ltd v Minister administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 [1986] HCA 68 ; (1986) 162 CLR 340 at 366: 
 
 "The representation must be a real inducement or one of the real inducements to engage in the conduct which occasions the loss" 
 
 Where a representation is relevant to the decision in question, and in its nature persuasive to induce the making of that decision, it accords with legal notions of causation to hold that it has a causative effect. And where a respondent, who may be taken to know his own business, has thought it was in his interests to misrepresent the situation in a particular respect, the Court may infer that the misrepresentation was persuasive. These inferences arise from the making of the respondent doing the thing it was calculated to induce him to do. All this is a matter of common sense. It has also been stated in the authorities. In Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 85 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236 Wilson J said: "If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation." His Honour went on to say that the "inference may be rebutted", but this is to imply that in the absence of rebuttal the conclusion should stand. ...

123 It has not been suggested that the Applicants were " careless " in relying upon any of the representations of the Respondents. Even carelessness or negligence on the part of an applicant, it may be noted, will not deny relief -- provided the carelessness has not been such as to destroy the causal connection between the contravening conduct and the loss or damage suffered: Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 at [13] , [2001] HCA 52 ; 206 CLR 459 at 468 9. Gleeson CJ there observed:
 [13] It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly, or will have been otherwise at fault, in responding to the inducement. The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute. Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s 82 unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage. ... [14] For there to be the necessary causal relationship between a contravention of s 52, and loss or damage, so as to satisfy the requirements of s 82(1), it is not essential that the contravention be the sole cause of the loss or damage. ... 
The present case is not a case of carelessness or negligence. In the present proceeding, the Applicants acted at all material times prudently. They retained the services of an experienced person (Mr Mellor), made their own inquiries, and carefully considered the options available. The present case is one in which representations were made by Mr Wieland for the very purpose of inducing or encouraging the purchase of his machine. Not only is there an inference available that those statements were instrumental in the execution of the contracts (cf Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 85 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236 per Wilson J; Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 95 at [41] , [2008] NSWCA 95 ; 66 ACSR 359 at 370), the fact is that those statements have been proven to have played a large part in the decision to acquire the SLP 1100.</text>

<text>122 The quantum of such loss or damage to which the Applicants, or either of them, may be entitled pursuant to s 82 thus remains a matter to be assessed. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that that task will be " to select a measure of damages which conforms to the remedial purpose of the statute and to the justice and equity of the case ": Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 at [18] , [2001] HCA 52 ; 206 CLR 459 at 470 per Gleeson CJ. The measure of the relief available under s 82 is not to be confined by an analogy with damages in contract or tort or equitable remedies: Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494. The task will be to ascertain the loss suffered by the contravening conduct and to assess the amount necessary to compensate for that loss: Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 at [66] , [2001] HCA 52 ; 206 CLR 459 at 482 per McHugh J. Although not confined by those analogies, they will usually be of " great assistance ": [2001] HCA 52 at [130] per McHugh J. But such analogies should not distract " attention from the primary task of construing the relevant provisions of the Act ": Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 at [44] , [2004] HCA 3 ; 216 CLR 388 at 407 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ.

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>58 The explanation provided by Mr Wieland as to why the inspections may well have occurred at an earlier point of time, namely that the dates appearing on the records are the dates upon which those " in the office " subsequently completed the records, is rejected. Such an explanation is inconsistent with that which the records expose -- the records requiring those conducting the inspections to certify that which they found and to state (for example) the " date of testing ". Mr Wieland ultimately accepted that the explanation he was advancing as a " possibility " was but " speculation ". In such circumstances, there is no reason not to find that the test records were carried out upon the dates set forth. The findings of fact that the machines were inspected on the dates appearing on the face of individual documents, it is considered, is supported by both the form of the documents themselves and the conclusion that Mr Wieland's evidence, especially in this respect, was considered to be unpersuasive. Moreover, those findings of fact are only further reinforced by the absence of any evidence being called from those persons employed in the Chinese factory to either support the " speculation " of Mr Wieland or to expressly state what the practice was in respect to the dating of inspection reports: cf Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 per Kitto J. Given the importance of the dates upon which inspections did in fact occur, being evidence centrally relevant to when the SLP 1100s were manufactured and were in fact in operation, it is considered that those persons who in fact completed the inspection reports (or at least perhaps one of them) could have shed light on the matter and would have been expected to have done so: cf RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 at [25] , [2000] HCA 3 ; 199 CLR 620 at 632 per Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.

177 In the absence of the " as built " drawings for the second SLP 1100 which failed, and in the absence of Mr Sun being called to give any evidence, the best evidence available to the Court as to the critical dimension presently in issue remained the measurements of Mr Better. That evidence, together with his conclusion, should be accepted. Even in the absence of recourse to the principle in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 per Kitto J, it is considered that the evidence of Mr Better was to be accepted.

178 Rejected is the express written submission advanced on behalf of the Respondents that " there was no explanation provided as to why the centre tongue in each of the samples was so badly decomposed ". It was Mr Better who provided that explanation.

179 A further line of cross-examination was to suggest that, if there had been insufficient axial clearance, the SLP 1100 would not have been operable at all -- or would not have been able to operate from April to August 2003. Mr Better's June 2008 Report addressed this possibility by maintaining that:
 Likely reasons for the operation during the 4-month period could be attributed to a combination of it being exposed to reasonably constant temperatures and the bearing assembly being greased regularly. It is also probable that there was some misalignment of the shaft and bearings and this would tend to cause point contact in the labyrinth, which would reduce the risk of seizing.</text>

<text>115 The contravening conduct of the Respondents may have caused loss or damage if that conduct was an inducement to the decision to purchase the SLP 1100: Lam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd (1989) 97 FLR 458 at 477 8 per Gleeson CJ (Samuels AJA and Meagher JA agreeing). The " causative threshold " remains a matter of judgment: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 235. Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ there observed (at 235):
 A finding that a misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did. Consistently with that finding, it may be that, on the balance of probabilities, a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation. Assuming a non-trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation, then it may be actionable. Ultimately, the "causative threshold" beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss, will be a question of judgment. This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd (supra) and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418 419 and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ATPR 49 ,849. (See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 84 ALR 700 at 712). But the mere possibility that a misrepresentation might have induced a course of action by the representee can never of itself attach liability under s 82 to the making of it.</text>

98 More recently, in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230 the Full Court revisited the construction of s 51A(2). Emmett J, one of the members of the Full Court, there observed:
 [44] Under s 51A(1) of the Trade Practices Act , a representation is to be taken to be misleading if it is a representation with respect to any future matter and the maker of the representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation. Under s 51A(2) , the maker of the representation with respect to any future matter is to be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation unless it adduces evidence to the contrary. However, if evidence is adduced by a representor to the effect that the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation, the deeming provision will not operate. Where the representor adduces such evidence, it is then a matter for the Court to determine, on the balance of probabilities in the ordinary way, whether or not the representor had reasonable grounds for making the representation. 
This is understood to be the same approach that His Honour had previously expressed. In McGrath Allsop J also referred to the views previously expressed by Emmett J in Universal Sports and continued:
 [192] If evidence is adduced by the representor that is said to be evidence to the contrary, it will be for the Court to determine whether it is to the contrary in the sense just discussed. If it is, the deeming provision will cease to operate. That was the view of Emmett J, as understood by Keane JA [Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 199]. That is my view. That was not, however, an expression of the view that the legal or persuasive onus has been changed by s 51A(2) , as some of the judgments in the "trend of established authority" referred to by Keane JA have stated. For instance, if evidence "to the contrary" is adduced by the representor, and if the representee itself adduces evidence tending to the lack of reasonable grounds, the matter might be equally poised. In such a case, there has been evidence "to the contrary" adduced by the representee, thereby eliminating the operation of the deeming provision, and, on the totality of the evidence, the proof of the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of the grounds is evenly balanced. Section 51A(2) does not, in my view, mean that in those circumstances the representor has not met an onus. The section does not cast the legal or persuasive onus, in such a case, on the representor. Its terms do not say so. The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so. Keane JA, despite his reference to the "trend of established [first instance] authority", does not say so. In my respectful view, to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group (1999) ATPR 41-704 ; Blacker [2000] FCA 681 ; Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 ; Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 and Emerald Ocean [2006] ATPR 42-096 say, or may be taken as saying, that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s 51A(2) , they are wrong. None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett J also agreed with Allsop J as to the operation of s 51A(2): [2008] FCA 2 at [6] , 165 FCR at 233 4. The third member of the Full Court, Stone J, considered that the issues thrown up by s 51A(2) were best left to be resolved by a Full Court where there had been full argument and where the outcome depended on the view taken of the section: [2008] FCAFC 2 at [76] , 165 FCR at 247 8.</text>

In such a case, there has been evidence "to the contrary" adduced by the representee, thereby eliminating the operation of the deeming provision, and, on the totality of the evidence, the proof of the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of the grounds is evenly balanced. Section 51A(2) does not, in my view, mean that in those circumstances the representor has not met an onus. The section does not cast the legal or persuasive onus, in such a case, on the representor. Its terms do not say so. The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so. Keane JA, despite his reference to the "trend of established [first instance] authority", does not say so. In my respectful view, to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group (1999) ATPR 41-704 ; Blacker [2000] FCA 681 ; Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 ; Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 and Emerald Ocean [2006] ATPR 42-096 say, or may be taken as saying, that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s 51A(2) , they are wrong. None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett J also agreed with Allsop J as to the operation of s 51A(2): [2008] FCA 2 at [6] , 165 FCR at 233 4. The third member of the Full Court, Stone J, considered that the issues thrown up by s 51A(2) were best left to be resolved by a Full Court where there had been full argument and where the outcome depended on the view taken of the section: [2008] FCAFC 2 at [76] , 165 FCR at 247 8.

99 The construction given to s 51A(2) by Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath , it is respectfully considered, should now be applied. On the facts of the present case, however, it would not have mattered which approach was followed.

100 In the present proceeding, the bases upon which Mr Wieland believed the SLP 1100 was both a reliable machine and would prove to be a reliable machine were summarised in the following exchange with his cross-examiner:
 Can I go back to the penultimate proposition that I took you to that is that the Wieland SLP 1100 has proved to be a reliable crusher and you said to me that that was an accurate statement as at September 2002, correct?---Mm. What are the facts, matters and circumstances upon which you rely to allow you to express the view as at September 2002 that the Wieland SLP 1100 had, at that stage, proven to be a reliable crusher?---Well, we had one running in Australia and Peter had no issues with it. It was based on a design of a very well-known crusher, the Telsmith 25 by 40 which, you know, you can find everywhere around the world in use, so it was well-proven technology. So those two factors are the two that you've identified, one, that there was one machine that was already running in Australia?---Yes. Secondly, it was based, to use your words, on a design of another machine that had a proven track record of reliability, correct?---Correct. Now, aside from those two matters, are there any other things that spring to mind?---Yes, I mean we've got a good workshop in China with new machine tools and we make other types of equipment so they had a good level of experience for building high tolerance machines.

101 The grounds upon which Mr Wieland relied to assert that the SLP 1100 would be a reliable machine thus essentially reduced themselves to two, namely:
 
(i) the fact that it was " heavily based " upon a design of another proven crusher, the " Telsmith 25/40 Single Toggle Jaw crusher " -- and, as Mr Wieland would have it, was not only based upon this design but was " over designed ". The SLP 1100 was said to be " an enhanced and improved design to the Telsmith " and a machine " reverse engineered " from the Telsmith; and 
 
(ii) the confidence that he had in his Chinese factory to manufacture the machine to a reliable standard.
 
It is considered that the former ground may have gone some way towards making out the reasonable grounds for the representation that the SLP 1100 would prove to be a reliable machine; but the confidence placed upon the Chinese factory was misplaced.

105 Upon the basis of such evidence, it is considered that there were no reasonable grounds upon which any representation could be made that the SLP 1100 would be a reliable machine. Had the former approach as to the construction of s 51A(2) been applied such that there was an onus upon the Respondents to establish reasonable grounds for the making of the representation, that onus would not have been discharged. Upon the approach of Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath , and acting upon the basis that the Respondents did adduce " evidence to the contrary ", it is considered that there was no reasonable basis upon which Mr Wieland could have made the representations as to reliability that he in fact made.

106 It is also considered that there were no reasonable grounds for the other representation as to a future matter, namely the representation that " by installing the Second SLP 1100 Readymix Holdings and Readymix Indonesia would not have any further problems with the operation of a SLP 1100 machine ".

107 It is thus considered that there has also been a contravention of s 52 of the 1974 Act by the First Respondent, Wieland Equipment , in respect to those " future matters " relied upon by the Applicants.</text>

Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false.

<text>184 Claims for damages for " economic loss " arising by reason of alleged negligent misrepresentations " present peculiar difficulty ": Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 at [21] , [2004] HCA 16 ; 216 CLR 515 at 529 30. As Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed:
 [21] Claims for damages for pure economic loss present peculiar difficulty. Competition is the hallmark of most forms of commercial activity in Australia. As Brennan J said in Bryan v Maloney [1995] HCA 17 ; [(1995) 182 CLR 609 at 632]: 
 
 "If liability were to be imposed for the doing of anything which caused pure economic loss that was foreseeable, the tort of negligence would destroy commercial competition [ Dorset Yacht Co v Home Office [1970] UKHL 2 ; [1970] AC 1004 at 1027], sterilise many contracts and, in the well-known dictum of Chief Judge Cardozo [ Ultramares Corporation v Touche (1931) 255 NY 170 at 179], expose defendants to potential liability 'in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class'." 
 
 That is why damages for pure economic loss are not recoverable if all that is shown is that the defendant's negligence was a cause of the loss and the loss was reasonably foreseeable. [22] In Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529] , the Court held that there were circumstances in which damages for economic loss were recoverable. In Caltex Oil, cases for recovery of economic loss were seen as being exceptions to a general rule, said to have been established in Cattle v Stockton Waterworks [(1875) LR 10 QB 453], that even if the loss was foreseeable, damages are not recoverable for economic loss which was not consequential upon injury to person or property. In Caltex Oil, Stephen J isolated a number of "salient features" which combined to constitute a sufficiently close relationship to give rise to a duty of care owed to Caltex for breach of which it might recover its purely economic loss [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529 at 576 8]. Chief among those features was the defendant's knowledge that to damage the pipeline which was damaged was inherently likely to produce economic loss [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529 at 576]. [23] Since Caltex Oil, and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; [(1999) 198 CLR 180] , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. "Vulnerability", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, "vulnerability" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant [Stapleton, 'Comparative Economic Loss: Lessons from Case-Law-Focused "Middle Theory"' (2002) 50 UCLA Law Review 531 at 558 9]. ... [24] In other cases of pure economic loss (Bryan v Maloney is an example) reference has been made to notions of assumption of responsibility and known reliance. The negligent misstatement cases like Mutual Life &amp; Citizens' Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt [1968] HCA 74 ; [(1968) 122 CLR 556] and Shaddock &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council [No 1] [1981] HCA 59 ; [(1981) 150 CLR 225] can be seen as cases in which a central plank in the plaintiff's allegation that the defendant owed it a duty of care is the contention that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on the accuracy of the information the defendant provided. And it may be, as Professor Stapleton has suggested ... that these cases, too, can be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability. (The reference in Caltex Oil to economic loss being "inherently likely" can also be seen as consistent with the importance of notions of vulnerability.) It is not necessary in this case, however, to attempt to identify or articulate the breadth of any general proposition about the importance of vulnerability. This case can be decided without doing so.

186 The " peculiar difficulties " presented by this cause of action need not therefore be confronted in the present proceeding, including the question as to whether the Respondents owed a duty of care to the Applicants. " In many cases ", it has been said, " there will be no sound reason for imposing a duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from economic loss where it was reasonably open to the plaintiff to take steps to protect itself ": Perre v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 at [118] , [1999] HCA 36 ; 198 CLR 180 at 225 per McHugh J. Whether or not there was a duty upon the Respondents in the present proceeding need not be resolved.

187 A hearing as to loss or damage should be held as soon as possible to bring this case, first commenced in March 2004, to conclusion. Any future hearing as to loss or damage must separately address any loss or damage suffered by each of the Applicants and the cause of action upon which reliance is sought to be placed.

188 Also outstanding is a Notice of Motion filed by the Respondents seeking further security for costs. That Motion was left outstanding pending these reasons being published.

189 The parties are to bring in such Short Minutes of Orders as are considered necessary to give effect to these reasons together with directions as to the future conduct of the proceeding, including the resolution of the Motion seeking further security.

190 Any order as to costs, it is presently considered, should await the resolution of the final hearing as to the quantification of loss of damage (if any) occasioned to the Applicants, or either of them. For present purposes, there is considered to be no reason why costs should not follow the event. It should also be noted that detailed written submissions were sought from the parties. The written submissions provided have proved to be of considerable assistance in the resolution of the issues.</text>

<text>143 Even in the absence of the concession on behalf of the Respondents that a term was to be implied into the February 2003 agreement, and even in the absence of the acceptance by Mr Wieland that it was as " plain as a pikestaff " that such a term was necessary to give business efficacy to the agreement, it would have been found that such a term would also have been implied pursuant to one or other of the statutory provisions otherwise in issue. It would, for example, have been difficult for Wieland Equipment to have denied that the purpose for which the SLP 1100 was being purchased had not been made known. Not only had Mr Wieland been told of the very site to which the machine was being sent and the use to which it was to be put, it may otherwise have been safely assumed that a purchaser who purchases a rock crusher does so for the purpose of crushing rocks: cf Priest v Last [1903] 2 KB 148. There would have been no other purpose for which such a machine would be purchased. There may, however, have been some room for argument as to whether the SLP 1100 was suitable for its particular use at the Jeladri Quarry. See: Brown I, ' The Swing of the Pendulum from Caveat Venditor to Caveat Emptor ' (2000) 116 LQR 537. But all such subtleties as may have emerged became unnecessary to resolve given the course ultimately pursued by the Respondents during oral submissions.

144 It is regrettable, however, that the position as ultimately advanced by Counsel for the Respondents during the course of oral submissions was not communicated to either the Applicants or the Court at a far earlier point of time. The very purpose of requiring a written outline of submissions to be filed in advance of oral submissions is to provide notice to both the opposing party and the Court of the issues in need of resolution. Written submissions filed after the close of evidence can self-evidently take into account an assessment of the submissions which can properly be advanced upon the basis of the evidence then available. That assessment may well be different to the manner in which a case has been opened. The failure to make a decision as to the submissions to be in fact advanced, and to make a decision confining submissions to issues more limited than those foreshadowed in either an opening or in a pleading, necessarily exposes both an opposing party and the Court to the very real potential for costs and resources to be unnecessarily incurred and expended.

145 Such has been the experience in the present proceeding -- at least insofar as the Court is concerned. Needless to say, the expeditious resolution of any dispute involves an identification of the issues to be resolved at the earliest opportunity.</text>

<text>115 The contravening conduct of the Respondents may have caused loss or damage if that conduct was an inducement to the decision to purchase the SLP 1100: Lam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd (1989) 97 FLR 458 at 477 8 per Gleeson CJ (Samuels AJA and Meagher JA agreeing). The " causative threshold " remains a matter of judgment: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Co Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 235. Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ there observed (at 235):
 A finding that a misrepresentation might have induced a decision will not of itself establish as a matter of probability that it did. Consistently with that finding, it may be that, on the balance of probabilities, a party was induced to make a decision by a combination of factors including the misrepresentation. Assuming a non-trivial contribution to the causative process by the misrepresentation, then it may be actionable. Ultimately, the "causative threshold" beyond which liability attaches to a misrepresentation which is one of a number of factors inducing a decision that produces loss, will be a question of judgment. This is a familiar process adverted to in various related contexts by Mason CJ in March v E &amp; M H Stramare Pty Ltd (supra) and in this Court in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418 419 and Pavich v Bobra Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ATPR 49 ,849. (See also Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 84 ALR 700 at 712). But the mere possibility that a misrepresentation might have induced a course of action by the representee can never of itself attach liability under s 82 to the making of it.</text>

<tocase>RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 , 199 CLR 620</tocase>
<text>58 The explanation provided by Mr Wieland as to why the inspections may well have occurred at an earlier point of time, namely that the dates appearing on the records are the dates upon which those " in the office " subsequently completed the records, is rejected. Such an explanation is inconsistent with that which the records expose -- the records requiring those conducting the inspections to certify that which they found and to state (for example) the " date of testing ". Mr Wieland ultimately accepted that the explanation he was advancing as a " possibility " was but " speculation ". In such circumstances, there is no reason not to find that the test records were carried out upon the dates set forth. The findings of fact that the machines were inspected on the dates appearing on the face of individual documents, it is considered, is supported by both the form of the documents themselves and the conclusion that Mr Wieland's evidence, especially in this respect, was considered to be unpersuasive. Moreover, those findings of fact are only further reinforced by the absence of any evidence being called from those persons employed in the Chinese factory to either support the " speculation " of Mr Wieland or to expressly state what the practice was in respect to the dating of inspection reports: cf Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 per Kitto J. Given the importance of the dates upon which inspections did in fact occur, being evidence centrally relevant to when the SLP 1100s were manufactured and were in fact in operation, it is considered that those persons who in fact completed the inspection reports (or at least perhaps one of them) could have shed light on the matter and would have been expected to have done so: cf RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 at [25] , [2000] HCA 3 ; 199 CLR 620 at 632 per Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.</text>

In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 the Full Court relevantly observed:
 If a corporation is alleged to have contravened s 52(1) by making a statement of past or present fact, the corporation's state of mind is immaterial unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind. Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false.

<text>96 One view has been that s 51A(2) casts a burden of proof upon those making a representation as to a future matter to show that there were reasonable grounds for making it: Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543. Hill J there observed (at 552):
 The section is but an interpretation section; it does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct. The relevant cause of action is to be found in s 82(1) of the Act by reference to the norm of conduct laid down in s 52 of the Act. What s 51A does, in a practical sense, in cases where it applies, is to cast the burden of proof upon the respondent corporation who has made a representation about a future matter to show that in making that representation it had reasonable grounds for so doing. In the language of Sheppard and Neaves JJ in Cummings v Lewis (1993) 113 ALR 285 ; ATPR (Digest) 46 103, s 51A is "designed to facilitate proof" (at ALR 294; ATPR 53,450). Representation as to future facts may, of course, constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within s 52 of the Act, irrespective of the operation of s 51A. However, without the intervention of s 51A the burden would remain upon the applicant to show that the representation, in whatever form it took, was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. In the ordinary case where a representation as to future conduct or events is alleged to have been made, that means that the burden would be upon the applicant to show not merely that the conduct or event has not come to pass but also that at the time the representation was made the respondent did not believe that the conduct or event would come to pass or that there was no basis for a belief that the conduct or event would come to pass: James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347 ; Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88; [1984] FCA 180 ; 55 ALR 25. It will be readily apparent that a representation as to future conduct or a future event will generally imply (and sometimes explicitly state) that the maker of the representation was of a particular state of mind as to the future conduct or event as at the time the representation was made. ...

<tocase>Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/55.html</AustLII>
<text>114 In order for the Applicants to recover damages under s 82 they must show that their loss or damage was occasioned " by " the contravening conduct. Sub-section (1) of s 82 of the 1974 Act thus provides as follows:
 Subject to subsection (1AAA), a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB or V or section 51AC may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention. 
With reference to the term " by ", Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 (at 525):
 By virtue of s 82(2) of the Act, the period of limitation begins to run at the time when the cause of action under s 82(1) accrues. As loss or damage is the gist of the statutory cause of action for which s 82(1) provides [Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418], the cause of action does not accrue until actual loss or damage is sustained. The statutory cause of action arises when the plaintiff suffers loss or damage "by" contravening conduct of another person. "By" is a curious word to use. One might have expected "by means of", "by reason of", "in consequence of" or "as a result of". But the word clearly expresses the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it. In this situation, s 82(1) should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation recently discussed by this Court in March v Stramare (E &amp; M H) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12 ; [(1991) 171 CLR 506] , except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act. Had Parliament intended to say something else, it would have been natural and easy to have said so.</text>

<tocase>Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 , 216 CLR 515</tocase>
<text>184 Claims for damages for " economic loss " arising by reason of alleged negligent misrepresentations " present peculiar difficulty ": Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 at [21] , [2004] HCA 16 ; 216 CLR 515 at 529 30. As Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed:
 [21] Claims for damages for pure economic loss present peculiar difficulty. Competition is the hallmark of most forms of commercial activity in Australia. As Brennan J said in Bryan v Maloney [1995] HCA 17 ; [(1995) 182 CLR 609 at 632]: 
 
 "If liability were to be imposed for the doing of anything which caused pure economic loss that was foreseeable, the tort of negligence would destroy commercial competition [ Dorset Yacht Co v Home Office [1970] UKHL 2 ; [1970] AC 1004 at 1027], sterilise many contracts and, in the well-known dictum of Chief Judge Cardozo [ Ultramares Corporation v Touche (1931) 255 NY 170 at 179], expose defendants to potential liability 'in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class'." 
 
 That is why damages for pure economic loss are not recoverable if all that is shown is that the defendant's negligence was a cause of the loss and the loss was reasonably foreseeable. [22] In Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge "Willemstad" [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529] , the Court held that there were circumstances in which damages for economic loss were recoverable. In Caltex Oil, cases for recovery of economic loss were seen as being exceptions to a general rule, said to have been established in Cattle v Stockton Waterworks [(1875) LR 10 QB 453], that even if the loss was foreseeable, damages are not recoverable for economic loss which was not consequential upon injury to person or property. In Caltex Oil, Stephen J isolated a number of "salient features" which combined to constitute a sufficiently close relationship to give rise to a duty of care owed to Caltex for breach of which it might recover its purely economic loss [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529 at 576 8]. Chief among those features was the defendant's knowledge that to damage the pipeline which was damaged was inherently likely to produce economic loss [1976] HCA 65 ; [(1976) 136 CLR 529 at 576]. [23] Since Caltex Oil, and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; [(1999) 198 CLR 180] , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. "Vulnerability", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, "vulnerability" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant [Stapleton, 'Comparative Economic Loss: Lessons from Case-Law-Focused "Middle Theory"' (2002) 50 UCLA Law Review 531 at 558 9]. ... [24] In other cases of pure economic loss (Bryan v Maloney is an example) reference has been made to notions of assumption of responsibility and known reliance. The negligent misstatement cases like Mutual Life &amp; Citizens' Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt [1968] HCA 74 ; [(1968) 122 CLR 556] and Shaddock &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council [No 1] [1981] HCA 59 ; [(1981) 150 CLR 225] can be seen as cases in which a central plank in the plaintiff's allegation that the defendant owed it a duty of care is the contention that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on the accuracy of the information the defendant provided. And it may be, as Professor Stapleton has suggested ... that these cases, too, can be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability. (The reference in Caltex Oil to economic loss being "inherently likely" can also be seen as consistent with the importance of notions of vulnerability.) It is not necessary in this case, however, to attempt to identify or articulate the breadth of any general proposition about the importance of vulnerability. This case can be decided without doing so.</text>
