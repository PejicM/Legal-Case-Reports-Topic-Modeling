<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v GIA Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-902</tocase>
<text>25 I accept a submission by counsel for the ACCC that the conduct of the defendant during the examinations on 28 February 2006 and 20 March 2006 was that of denial and laying of a false trail rather than that of minimisation and evasion: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v GIA Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-902 at 45,419 [19] per Heerey J.

26 There are no such other offences.

27 The offences occurred on both 28 February 2006 and 20 March 2006 and to that extent each offence formed part of a course of conduct, at least within the boundaries of the defendant's giving of evidence before the member of the ACCC.</text>

<tocase>Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 ; (2002) 209 CLR 339</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/6.html</AustLII>
<text>31 I find it convenient to set out here paras 18 21 of the submissions of counsel for the ACCC:
 
 
 18. In Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74 ; (1998) 194 CLR 656 the High Court said at 663[-664]: 
 
 
 
 
 A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself or herself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed. On the other hand, a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation; first, because it is usually evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender, and second, on the pragmatic ground that the community is spared the expense of a contested trial. The extent of the mitigation may vary depending on the circumstances of the case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 19. In Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 ; (2002) 209 CLR 339, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, after referring to this passage, said at 343: 
 
 
 
 
 ... the rationale for that rule [that a plea of guilty should be taken into account in mitigation], so far as it depends on factors other than remorse and acceptance of responsibility, [should] be expressed in terms of willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing.
 
 
 
 
 
 20. Their Honours went on to say (at 346) that a significant consideration on the issue of the extent to which a plea of guilty is indicative of remorse, acceptance of responsibility and willingness to facilitate the course of justice is whether it was entered at the first available opportunity.
 
 21. Although there appears to be a divergence of opinion in the High Court with respect to a "two stage" approach to sentencing as opposed to an "instinctive synthesis" (as discussed by Kirby J in Cameron v The Queen at 361[ff]) it is submitted that it is permissible for a sentencing judge to identify the measure of discount allowed for a plea of guilty.</text>

<text>18 Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Crimes Act ) lists matters that the court must take into account when passing sentence, to the extent that they are relevant and known to the court. However, the list is not exhaustive, and, in particular, a court must consider general deterrence although it is not listed in s 16A(2): see R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427 at 434C E; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377F 378G.</text>
