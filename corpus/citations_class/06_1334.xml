<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517</tocase>
<text>The respondent said that given the power to administer an oath or affirmation (s 52(4)), the fact that the obligation to answer questions is subject to only limited excuses (s 52(6) and s 53) and the right to legal representation (s 52(3)) a power in the ABC Commissioner to regulate and control an examination must be implied. That conclusion was, said the respondent, supported by the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 (' Bell ').

In Bell , an inspector was conducting an examination in the course of an investigation by the Australian Securities Commission ('the Commission') and he made an order that an examinee not be represented by a particular legal practitioner. The order was made on the basis that the legal practitioner had appeared for a number of examinees and the legal practitioner's firm had been involved in the preparation of a prospectus which might be under consideration in the course of the investigation.

The Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth) contained provisions to the effect that an examinee may have legal representation (s 23(1)) , that an examination was to be in private (s 22(1)) , that the inspector could determine who was to be present at the examination (s 22(1)) , and provisions dealing with the inspector's powers to control the conduct of a legal representative at an examination (s 23(2)).

The decisions in A, B and D and Bell were referred to with approval by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Re Whiting [1994] 1 Qd R 561. A firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the Criminal Justice Act 1989 (Qld) and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding. The Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the Commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made. An application to the Supreme Court challenging the order was dismissed.

In Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244, French J followed Bell and in the course of his reasons said (at 254): 
 
 'Where one lawyer seeks to represent a number of examinees in the same investigation, it may be thought that there is a risk that without consciously intending any impropriety that lawyer might divulge to one examinee what has passed in the examination of another. The extension of a restriction to all members of a given firm may be controversial: see Wood v National Companies &amp; Securities Commission (1990) 2 WAR 176. However there are matters of judgment and assessment involved. It is of course, not the role of the ASC to supervise the lawyer-client relationships of those who appear before it in s 19 examinations. It is only where a conflict of interest has some actual or potential impact on the investigative process that a direction based on such a concern would be within power.'

In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284, French J considered whether the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ('the Commission') had the power to give a non-disclosure direction and to direct that solicitors who had acted for other persons the Commission might wish to examine be excluded from the applicants' examinations. He followed Bell and his own decision in Stockbridge v Ogilvie (supra) and held that the Commission had both these powers.

The statutory provisions in this case are very general. They may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as A, B and D and Bell . Nevertheless, I think it is clear that the ABC Commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him. He can determine when and where an examination will be held and, providing a proper basis exists, he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present. He is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct. He must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and, to a point, its effectiveness. In my opinion, he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination.

It is appropriate for me to consider whether, insofar as the direction is within power, there was a proper basis to exercise the power. The test as formulated in A, B and D is whether the decision-maker 'concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will, or may, prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute' (at 448). In Bell , Lockhart J said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of 'will or is likely to' prejudice the investigation, although he went on to say that 'the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case' (at 522). In my respectful opinion, although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier, the weight of authority is in favour of the test of 'will or may' prejudice the investigation and it is that test which I will apply.</text>

<tocase>Constantine v Trade Practices Commissioner (1994) 48 FCR 141</tocase>
<text>The first question is whether examinations under s 52 of the Act are to be conducted in private. I did not understand the applicant to suggest that the examinations are not to be conducted in private. In my opinion, they are to be conducted in private. In Constantine v Trade Practices Commissioner (1994) 48 FCR 141 (' Constantine ') a person (the applicant) was served with a notice pursuant to s 155(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) requiring him to give evidence about matters specified in the notice and to produce documents. He was permitted to have legal representation within certain limits. However, as a condition of that permission the applicant's legal representative was required to give certain undertakings as to non-disclosure. That condition was challenged by the applicant. Jenkinson J first considered whether examinations pursuant to a notice under s 155(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) were private. He held that they were private. He said (at 146-147): 
 
 'The authorities on which Mr Merkel relied as favouring privacy in the conduct of investigations into suspected contraventions of the law are concerned with prohibition of the investigator's inclination to proceed in public, not with prohibition of disclosure by those examined of what has occurred during the examination: see Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General [1932] AC 392; Re Pergamon Press Ltd [1971] Ch 388 at 400, 404; Finnane v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1978] 2 NSWLR 435. In the latter case Needham J observed (at 445): "There is much to be said for the proposition that the inspector [investigating the affairs of several companies under Pt VIA of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW)] is bound to observe the confidences of the witnesses whom he examines; none of those cases has anything to say about the right of the witness to disclose what the inspector said to him and what he said to the inspector." However, observance of the confidences of the witnesses requires privacy of their examination. My conclusion is that an examination pursuant to a notice under s 155(1)(c) served for the purpose of investigating whether a contravention of the Act has occurred is required to be held in private. A clear legislative intention is to be discerned in the provisions of the Act, particularly in Pt VI and s 163 that the Commission should have the function of taking and authorising curial proceedings, civil and criminal, in respect of contraventions of the Act. Exercise in public of the investigative powers conferred by s 155 on the Commission, to enable it to determine whether or not a contravention has occurred and to procure means of proving in a curial proceeding that a contravention has occurred, is so likely to be inimical to the effectiveness of the investigation and to interests of those who are the subjects of investigation, both witnesses and those suspected of contravention, that the requirement of privacy may be seen to have been intended by the legislature, notwithstanding that the requirement is not explicitly stated in the Act: cf Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General (supra) at 401. 
 Whatever may be the position of the person who is examined on oath or affirmation, there is authority for the conclusion that his legal representative, present during a private investigative examination, may lawfully be required by the investigator to undertake not for a certain time to disclose to others what has been disclosed to the legal representative during the examination. Re London and Northern Bank Ltd [1902] 2 Ch D 73 was a case in which a solicitor was held by the Court of Appeal to have been rightly required, as a condition of his being permitted to represent a witness under private investigative examination by the liquidator in a winding-up, to undertake to the Registrar conducting the examination not to disclose to others information required at the examination. The solicitor was employed by a firm which was acting for a company then engaged in litigation with the company in liquidation and that circumstance was noticed by the members of the Court as justifying the Registrar's requirement.'

In this case the requirement that an examination be held in private arises by implication rather than by reason of an express provision. I do not think that that is a ground upon which to distinguish what the Full Court said in Bankers Trust and I agree with what Jenkinson J said in Constantine (at 148): 
 
 'Whether the legislative requirement of examination in private be expressly given or laboriously found, the necessary implications must in my opinion be the same.'

Having decided that an examination must be conducted in private and that an ABC Commissioner has the power to make a non-disclosure direction, I now address the question whether the ABC Commissioner has the power to direct that an examinee not be represented at an examination by a particular legal practitioner. The right to legal representation is an important right and may well have been implied in this case even in the absence of s 52(3) of the Act ( Constantine per Jenkinson J (at 150)).

It seems to me that having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and the authorities which I will now discuss, the ABC Commissioner has such a power.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/45.html</AustLII>
<text>In reaching that conclusion I acknowledge the force of the respondent's reasoning. In terms of avoiding prejudice to the investigation there is much to be said for a direction which would prevent Ms Boots from assisting the applicant in preparing for the examination. However, I do not think that because a direction preventing a solicitor acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination is justified by reference to the need to avoid prejudice to the investigation that that in turn means that any direction that might avoid prejudice to the investigation is within power. The question is what can be implied from the statutory provisions. In the case of inferior courts or tribunals the test for implying a power is a reasonably demanding one and a court will look carefully at the statutory provisions to discern if the particular power is legally ancillary to some other power which the inferior court or tribunal possesses, or is reasonably required for the purposes of some other such power or powers: Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 per Dawson J at 16-17; Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19 ; (1999) 198 CLR 435; Medical Board of SA v N, JRP (2006) 93 SASR 546. There is no reason to think that a similar test does not apply in the case of an ABC Commissioner conducting an investigation under the Act. The power to direct that a solicitor not act for a party is a significant power and, whilst it may not be correct to say that a party has a right to be represented by a solicitor of his or her own choice, the Courts have looked carefully at the circumstances before making an order that a solicitor not act for a party: Rakusen v Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke [1912] 1 Ch 831. Courts have made such orders either in the exercise of their inherent jurisdiction (Mr K Mason QC, 'The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court' (1983) Australian Law Journal 449) or, put another way, their special jurisdiction over solicitors who are officers of the court ( Rakusen v Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke (supra) per Cozens-Hardy MR at 835) or by reference to a substantive doctrine of law such as the need to protect confidential information. Clearly, the ABC Commissioner does not have such powers and I do not think that there are sufficiently strong indications in the statutory provisions to conclude that there is an implied statutory power to make a direction which goes beyond preventing a solicitor from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination.</text>

<text>The first question is whether examinations under s 52 of the Act are to be conducted in private. I did not understand the applicant to suggest that the examinations are not to be conducted in private. In my opinion, they are to be conducted in private. In Constantine v Trade Practices Commissioner (1994) 48 FCR 141 (' Constantine ') a person (the applicant) was served with a notice pursuant to s 155(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) requiring him to give evidence about matters specified in the notice and to produce documents.

 'The authorities on which Mr Merkel relied as favouring privacy in the conduct of investigations into suspected contraventions of the law are concerned with prohibition of the investigator's inclination to proceed in public, not with prohibition of disclosure by those examined of what has occurred during the examination: see Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General [1932] AC 392; Re Pergamon Press Ltd [1971] Ch 388 at 400, 404; Finnane v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1978] 2 NSWLR 435.

However, observance of the confidences of the witnesses requires privacy of their examination. My conclusion is that an examination pursuant to a notice under s 155(1)(c) served for the purpose of investigating whether a contravention of the Act has occurred is required to be held in private. A clear legislative intention is to be discerned in the provisions of the Act, particularly in Pt VI and s 163 that the Commission should have the function of taking and authorising curial proceedings, civil and criminal, in respect of contraventions of the Act. Exercise in public of the investigative powers conferred by s 155 on the Commission, to enable it to determine whether or not a contravention has occurred and to procure means of proving in a curial proceeding that a contravention has occurred, is so likely to be inimical to the effectiveness of the investigation and to interests of those who are the subjects of investigation, both witnesses and those suspected of contravention, that the requirement of privacy may be seen to have been intended by the legislature, notwithstanding that the requirement is not explicitly stated in the Act: cf Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General (supra) at 401. 
 Whatever may be the position of the person who is examined on oath or affirmation, there is authority for the conclusion that his legal representative, present during a private investigative examination, may lawfully be required by the investigator to undertake not for a certain time to disclose to others what has been disclosed to the legal representative during the examination. Re London and Northern Bank Ltd [1902] 2 Ch D 73 was a case in which a solicitor was held by the Court of Appeal to have been rightly required, as a condition of his being permitted to represent a witness under private investigative examination by the liquidator in a winding-up, to undertake to the Registrar conducting the examination not to disclose to others information required at the examination. The solicitor was employed by a firm which was acting for a company then engaged in litigation with the company in liquidation and that circumstance was noticed by the members of the Court as justifying the Registrar's requirement.'

The question is one of the intention of Parliament and that intention is to be discerned from the provisions of the Act: Hearts of Oak Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General [1932] AC 392. In my opinion, an examination under s 52 is to be conducted in private. Privacy or confidentiality is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of an examination and of an investigation which may lead to the ABC Commissioner instituting proceedings for a contravention of the Act and the recovery of a civil penalty. As I have said, the obligation on (among others) an ABC Commissioner or a Deputy ABC Commissioner to preserve the confidentiality of information obtained under the Act is a strict one and subject to criminal penalties for breach and it is subject to clearly defined exceptions in s 65(3) of the Act.

The second question is whether the ABC Commissioner has the power to make a non-disclosure direction. Again, I did not understand the applicant to suggest that the ABC Commissioner did not have the power to make a non-disclosure direction. In my opinion, the ABC Commissioner has such a power.</text>

<tocase>Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (2005) 154 A Crim R 336</tocase>
<text>There was no suggestion that Ms Boots would knowingly disclose confidential information to the applicant. Nevertheless, the respondent considered that to permit the same legal representative to appear for the applicant will or may prejudice the investigation. The essence of the respondent's reasons is set out above (at [26]). I have read the written notice issued to B and the record of his examination and I am satisfied that there is a proper basis for the respondent's conclusion that the applicant's examination will be 'virtually identical' to the subject matter of the examination of B. This is not a case like that which was before Mansfield J in Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (2005) 154 A Crim R 336 where the evidence did not disclose the nature of the previous examination. Mansfield J said (at 347): 
 
 'But the risk of such disclosure does not arise by assertion. It must arise on material known to the examiner. Here, I have found the examiner had no relevant knowledge, other than the counsel having previously appeared at an examination by another examiner of another person in the same special investigation. The nature of the former examinee or of the evidence that person gave or of the questions that person was asked was not known.'

In this case once one concludes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure is a sufficient basis for a direction (as it is on the authorities) the conclusion that there was a proper basis for a direction preventing Ms Boots from acting or appearing for the applicant at his examination is inevitable.

The respondent had the power to make a direction that Ms Boots not act or appear for the applicant at the examination and there was a proper basis for the exercise of the discretion to make such a direction. However, the direction actually made by the respondent went further than this, and, to the extent that it did, it is beyond power.

In view of those conclusions I will hear the parties as to the appropriate orders and on the question of costs.

In terms of avoiding prejudice to the investigation there is much to be said for a direction which would prevent Ms Boots from assisting the applicant in preparing for the examination. However, I do not think that because a direction preventing a solicitor acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination is justified by reference to the need to avoid prejudice to the investigation that that in turn means that any direction that might avoid prejudice to the investigation is within power. The question is what can be implied from the statutory provisions. In the case of inferior courts or tribunals the test for implying a power is a reasonably demanding one and a court will look carefully at the statutory provisions to discern if the particular power is legally ancillary to some other power which the inferior court or tribunal possesses, or is reasonably required for the purposes of some other such power or powers: Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 per Dawson J at 16-17; Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19 ; (1999) 198 CLR 435; Medical Board of SA v N, JRP (2006) 93 SASR 546. There is no reason to think that a similar test does not apply in the case of an ABC Commissioner conducting an investigation under the Act.

<tocase>National Companies and Securities Commission v Bankers Trust Australian Ltd (1989) 24 FCR 217</tocase>
<text>In National Companies and Securities Commission v Bankers Trust Australian Ltd (1989) 24 FCR 217 (' Bankers Trust ') a person who appeared before the National Companies and Securities Commission during the course of an investigation was required not to discuss the evidence given with any person other than his legal counsel. A similar direction was given to his legal counsel. Those directions were challenged on the basis (inter alia) that there was no power to make them. The Full Court of this Court held that there was power to make a non-disclosure direction, but a majority held that the particular order was beyond power because it went beyond the period in respect of which the Commission's implied power to prohibit disclosure could reasonably operate. Only the general question of power is relevant here. There were express statutory provisions to the effect that the Commission could direct that the hearing take place in private and give directions as to the persons who may be present at a private hearing. Lockhart J noted those provisions and said that the power to maintain the privacy of the evidence was a necessary element in the private hearing itself. His Honour said (at 221): 
 
 'It may appear odd that a like power was not vested in terms in the Commission when hearings commence as private hearings. In my opinion the answer is not that there is a lacuna in the legislation, but that the power of the Commission to conduct a hearing in private pursuant to s 36 and the express power conferred by s 36(5) to determine who should be present carries with it as an integral element of such a hearing the power to give directions preventing or restricting the publication of evidence given before it or of matters contained in documents lodged with it; otherwise the power to hold hearings in private would be of little value. The essence of a private hearing before the Commission is that what takes place is in private and, therefore, by definition and of necessity not open or accessible to the public.'

In this case the requirement that an examination be held in private arises by implication rather than by reason of an express provision. I do not think that that is a ground upon which to distinguish what the Full Court said in Bankers Trust and I agree with what Jenkinson J said in Constantine (at 148): 
 
 'Whether the legislative requirement of examination in private be expressly given or laboriously found, the necessary implications must in my opinion be the same.'</text>

<tocase>National Crime Authority v A, B and D (1988) 18 FCR 439</tocase>
<text>The respondent also referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in National Crime Authority v A, B and D (1988) 18 FCR 439 (' A, B and D' ) and said that the reasoning in that case was applicable to the case before him. The power of a statutory authority to regulate its own proceedings included as an implied power the more specific power to exclude a particular legal representative. The respondent gave examples of how an examination could be seriously undermined if there was no power to exclude a particular legal representative. He said: 
 
 'The absence of a power to preclude a particular legal practitioner from representing a witness could, in some circumstances, seriously undermine the efficacy of an examination. For example, if a lawyer acted improperly in an examination by, for example, prompting a witness or repeatedly obstructing the examination, the absence of the relevant power may seriously prejudice the examination. To take another example, if the legal practitioner was also the subject of the particular investigation, it would be highly undesirable for the legal practitioner to represent the witness, and he/she should not be permitted to do so. These examples highlight the need for the relevant power.'

The respondent then turned to the exercise of the relevant discretion. In considering this question he proceeded on the basis that the question was whether there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the representation either 'will or may prejudice the investigation'. He adopted this test in preference to a test formulated in terms of 'will or is likely to prejudice the investigation', although he said that even on the latter test he would exercise the discretion in the same way.

The respondent recognised as an important factor to which he must give weight, the applicant's wish to have present the legal representative of his choice. However, he was satisfied that the examination of the applicant would canvass the same subject matter as was raised with B on 9 November 2005. Even accepting, as he did, that there was no suggestion that Ms Boots would deliberately prejudice the investigation he said there were reasonable grounds to conclude that Ms Boots' representation of the applicant at the examination 'will, or may prejudice the investigation'. The essence of his reasoning in that regard is contained in the following two paragraphs: 
 
 'Because of Ms Boots' attendance at the previous examination, Ms Boots is aware of the topics and issues that are likely to be covered by counsel assisting in questions and how counsel assisting is likely to proceed. Ms Boots is aware of the answers given by the previous witness, and how the previous witness handled questions. If, consistent with Ms Boots' duty to Mr Bonan, she has taken Mr Bonan to the issues and matters likely to arise, Mr Bonan may be aware of the general nature of the questions that will be asked, and the areas that will be focused on. There is accordingly a real risk that the evidence of Mr Bonan may be influenced by the evidence provided by the previous witness. In my experience in this industry, it is very important that witnesses give evidence unaffected by any evidence given by other witnesses. 
 
 These comments are by no means a criticism of Ms Boots. I accept Mr Jacobs' submissions that there is no suggestion that Ms Boots will deliberately prejudice the investigation. However, consistent with Ms Boots' duty to Mr Bonan, I accept that there is a real risk that Ms Boots may unintentionally, perhaps subconsciously, reveal to Mr Bonan matters that would in effect forewarn him. This would prejudice the investigation.'

After referring to the authorities dealing with the power to restrict publication Beaumont and Einfeld JJ said (at 232): 
 
 'In the present case, the Commission was given, expressly, the power to direct that the hearing take place privately. In aid of that power, the Commission was also given, in our opinion, by necessary implication, the power to take all reasonable steps, which when viewed objectively, were necessary in order to ensure that the hearing was conducted privately. The Commission is entitled to regulate its proceedings to avoid a situation arising where the confidentiality of information obtained by it may be exposed to the risk of premature disclosure cf National Crime Authority v A, B and D (1988) 18 FCR 439 at 447-448. This is not to say that the information should always be regarded as confidential. But, in order to conduct a hearing properly, it is necessary that the Commission have the power to prohibit, at least during the hearing itself, the disclosure of information obtained at the hearing. Publication of that material before the conclusion of the hearing could prejudice the effective conduct of the hearing. It follows, in our opinion, that it is proper to imply in the Act a power in the Commission to prevent or restrict the premature publication of evidence given at the hearing; or to put the matter positively rather than negatively, the Commission had the power, by necessary implication, to take all reasonable steps which were necessary to secure a "private", rather than a "public", hearing.'

In A, B and D , the Authority ('the Authority') was conducting a special investigation and for that purpose it held a number of hearings. Under the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) a witness at an examination had a right to be represented by a legal practitioner: s 25(4). A witness was represented by a legal practitioner and that witness's spouse also gave evidence and was represented by the same legal practitioner. It was proposed that the same practitioner would appear for three further witnesses. The Authority decided that the legal practitioner could not appear for the three proposed witnesses and they challenged the decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). Their challenge was initially successful but failed on appeal to the Full Court of this Court. There is no doubt that the statutory provisions under consideration in A, B and D were quite different from the statutory provisions in this case. There were express provisions providing that hearings were to be held in private and that the Authority could make a non-disclosure direction. There was a provision giving the Authority incidental powers which, at one point in its reasons, the Full Court of this Court described as the 'critical provision': at 447. The offences which were to be the subject of an investigation were serious criminal offences. The Court said (at 446-447): 
 
 'A starting point for the consideration of the problem is the nature of the Authority and of its functions. It is concerned with investigating, either generally on its own initiative, or specially on references to it pursuant to ss 13 or 14 of the Act, a wide range of serious criminal activity, or suspected criminal activity, in the community. The powers it has are expressed in wide terms and it is clear that the legislature intended its powers to be extensive and far-reaching. Even without s 19 there could be no doubt, notwithstanding the provisions of s 25(4), that the Authority had power to regulate its own proceedings with a view to ensuring that they were not prejudiced, or exposed to the risk of being prejudiced, by the conduct of any person, whether involved in a hearing before it or otherwise. 
 ... 
 We think that the essential nature of the Authority and the functions with which it has been entrusted, when considered along with s 19 of the Act, lead to the conclusion that the power exists. We also regard s 46(8) as a further factor reinforcing this conclusion. It may seem strange that a provision dealing with meetings of the Authority should be relevant to the problem, but s 25(3) expressly applies s 46 to hearings . '

Lockhart J said that an inspector must have the power 'effectively to regulate and control the investigation which he is conducting' (at 520). His Honour's reasons were closely linked to the statutory provisions under consideration, although he did say (at 522): 
 
 'The power created by s 22(1) is expressed in positive terms, namely, the giving of directions about who may be present, and not in negative terms about who may not be present; s 22(2) achieves this to a degree. It seems to me, however, that to sensibly construe s 22(1) requires that the inspector be authorised to direct who may and who may not be present. The express power to give directions about who may be present implies a like power about who may not be present. 
 It may be that the inspector's power to exclude a particular lawyer would exist as being reasonably incidental or ancillary to the proper conduct of the examination even if the specific power conferred by s 22(1) was absent; but it is not necessary to consider this because of the power conferred by s 22(1). 
 ... 
 The Full Court concluded in the A case [National Crime Authority v A (1988) 18 FCR 439] that the National Crime Authority had the power to regulate its own proceedings by excluding a legal practitioner "if it concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will, or may, prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute". I have reached a similar conclusion with respect to ss 22 and 23 of the Act though, in this case, my preferred test of "will or is likely to" presents a slightly higher barrier than "will, or may"; but the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case. In my view, the differences between the two Acts and the basis of the power being s 22(1) coupled with an abuse of power under s 23(1), as opposed to the broader policy considerations relied on in the A case, lead to this result.'

The decisions in A, B and D and Bell were referred to with approval by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Re Whiting [1994] 1 Qd R 561. A firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the Criminal Justice Act 1989 (Qld) and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding. The Chairman of the Criminal Justice Commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the Commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made. An application to the Supreme Court challenging the order was dismissed.

The statutory provisions in this case are very general. They may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as A, B and D and Bell . Nevertheless, I think it is clear that the ABC Commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him. He can determine when and where an examination will be held and, providing a proper basis exists, he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present. He is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct. He must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and, to a point, its effectiveness. In my opinion, he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination.

It is appropriate for me to consider whether, insofar as the direction is within power, there was a proper basis to exercise the power. The test as formulated in A, B and D is whether the decision-maker 'concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will, or may, prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute' (at 448). In Bell , Lockhart J said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of 'will or is likely to' prejudice the investigation, although he went on to say that 'the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case' (at 522). In my respectful opinion, although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier, the weight of authority is in favour of the test of 'will or may' prejudice the investigation and it is that test which I will apply.</text>

<text>In reaching that conclusion I acknowledge the force of the respondent's reasoning. In terms of avoiding prejudice to the investigation there is much to be said for a direction which would prevent Ms Boots from assisting the applicant in preparing for the examination. However, I do not think that because a direction preventing a solicitor acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination is justified by reference to the need to avoid prejudice to the investigation that that in turn means that any direction that might avoid prejudice to the investigation is within power. The question is what can be implied from the statutory provisions. In the case of inferior courts or tribunals the test for implying a power is a reasonably demanding one and a court will look carefully at the statutory provisions to discern if the particular power is legally ancillary to some other power which the inferior court or tribunal possesses, or is reasonably required for the purposes of some other such power or powers: Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 per Dawson J at 16-17; Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19 ; (1999) 198 CLR 435; Medical Board of SA v N, JRP (2006) 93 SASR 546. There is no reason to think that a similar test does not apply in the case of an ABC Commissioner conducting an investigation under the Act. The power to direct that a solicitor not act for a party is a significant power and, whilst it may not be correct to say that a party has a right to be represented by a solicitor of his or her own choice, the Courts have looked carefully at the circumstances before making an order that a solicitor not act for a party: Rakusen v Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke [1912] 1 Ch 831. Courts have made such orders either in the exercise of their inherent jurisdiction (Mr K Mason QC, 'The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court' (1983) Australian Law Journal 449) or, put another way, their special jurisdiction over solicitors who are officers of the court ( Rakusen v Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke (supra) per Cozens-Hardy MR at 835) or by reference to a substantive doctrine of law such as the need to protect confidential information. Clearly, the ABC Commissioner does not have such powers and I do not think that there are sufficiently strong indications in the statutory provisions to conclude that there is an implied statutory power to make a direction which goes beyond preventing a solicitor from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination.</text>

<tocase>Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244</tocase>
<text>In Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244, French J followed Bell and in the course of his reasons said (at 254): 
 
 'Where one lawyer seeks to represent a number of examinees in the same investigation, it may be thought that there is a risk that without consciously intending any impropriety that lawyer might divulge to one examinee what has passed in the examination of another. The extension of a restriction to all members of a given firm may be controversial: see Wood v National Companies &amp; Securities Commission (1990) 2 WAR 176. However there are matters of judgment and assessment involved. It is of course, not the role of the ASC to supervise the lawyer-client relationships of those who appear before it in s 19 examinations. It is only where a conflict of interest has some actual or potential impact on the investigative process that a direction based on such a concern would be within power.'

In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284, French J considered whether the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ('the Commission') had the power to give a non-disclosure direction and to direct that solicitors who had acted for other persons the Commission might wish to examine be excluded from the applicants' examinations. He followed Bell and his own decision in Stockbridge v Ogilvie (supra) and held that the Commission had both these powers.</text>
