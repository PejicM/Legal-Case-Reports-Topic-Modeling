<text>12 The notice of appeal filed by Mr Lim does not identify a question of law capable of constituting the subject matter of his purported appeal (see, Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 at [26] - [34] ). The factual assertion that Mr Lim had made arrangements, apparently after breaching one of his agreements, to attend at WorkDirections on an extra day in a later week does not itself constitute a question of law. Nor does it by implication raise a question of law the answer to which could throw doubt on the correctness of the decision of the Tribunal. The references in the notice of appeal to the law of "attendance" and "reasonable excuse" do not assist Mr Lim in this regard.

13 Nonetheless, as Mr Lim does not have the benefit of legal representation, I have considered it appropriate to approach the issue of the competence of the appeal by giving consideration to any questions of law that Mr Lim could reasonably expect to be able to obtain leave to include in his notice of appeal were he to apply to amend that document. Mr Lim identified the following matters which he characterised as legal errors:
 
(a) it was not legally possible, he argued, for the Tribunal to find that he had breached his Activity Agreement on 27 April 2007 (and possibly on other occasions) as he had received emails from WorkDirections requiring him to make-up missed days;
 
(b) it was not open to the Tribunal, he argued, to find that he had breached one of his Activity Agreements unless his case manager, Rebecca, had asserted that he had done so;
 
(c) he was, he argued, only legally obliged to attend at WorkDirections if his case manager, Rebecca, was present on that day and she was not present on one of the days on which the Tribunal found that he had breached his Activity Agreement without reasonable excuse;
 
(d) he argued that WorkDirections imposed an unlawful condition on him by requiring him to find job interviews for himself; and
 
(e) he argued that his case manager, Rebecca, made an administrative error by requiring him on short notice to make up for missed attendances.

14 None of the above alleged legal errors gives rise to a question of law that Mr Lim could reasonably expect to be able to obtain leave to include in his notice of appeal. They each concern an issue not raised by him before the Tribunal. More importantly, they reflect a clear misapprehension of the obligations imposed on Mr Lim by the agreements signed by him.</text>
