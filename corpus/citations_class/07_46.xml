<text>10 The applicant referred the Court to Logue v Hansen Technologies Ltd [2003] FCA 81 ; (2003) 125 FCR 590 (a case concerning an application for security for costs) in which Weinberg J noted at 599:
 
 '... the test for ordinary residence depends to a significant degree upon the state of mind of the person whose residence is in question. The language used in a number of the cases focuses upon whether the person habitually and normally resides in the jurisdiction, and does so for a settled purpose.'</text>

<tocase>Mathai v Kwee [2005] FCA 932</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/932.html</AustLII>
<text>8 This statement was referred to with apparent approval by Graham J in Mathai v Kwee [2005] FCA 932 at [124] . His Honour referred to tennis and golf professionals as examples of people who travel away from the place or places where they are ordinarily resident, in order to earn their incomes. Indeed, in Mathai , Graham J found that a tax consultant who had spent only two out of the preceding 20 or so years actually residing in Australian was, nonetheless, ordinarily resident here.</text>

<tocase>Re Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank Limited (1992) 37 FCR 194</tocase>
<text>5 In Re Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank Limited (1992) 37 FCR 194 at 197 Lockhart J said, in a statement that is now settled law:
 
 'I shall not attempt to give any comprehensive definition of the word "resident". It has no technical or special meaning for the purposes of the Act. Nor do the words "ordinarily resident" have any such technical or special meaning. They are ordinary English words. Whether a debtor is ordinarily resident in Australia is a question of fact and degree.' 

His Honour further noted at 198:
 
 'To say that a person is ordinarily resident in Australia must mean something more than that he is resident in Australia. The word "ordinarily" connotes a comparison, a measure of degree. A person may have more than one residence, but he is not necessarily ordinarily resident in each of them. The question must be determined for the purposes of s 43 of the Act at a particular time. One must ask the question whether at that time the person was ordinarily resident in Australia. The concept of "ordinary residence" for the purposes of the Act, in my opinion, connotes a place where in the ordinary course of a person's life he regularly or customarily lives. There must be some element of permanence, to be contrasted with a place where he stays only casually or intermittently. The expression "ordinarily resident in" connotes some habit of life, and is to be contrasted with temporary or occasional residence...' 
 (emphasis added)

7 In Taylor, whilst Lockhart J considered that ordinary residence required a degree of regularity or permanence, his Honour also expressed the view (at 198) that a person might have more than one ordinary residence:
 
 'A person may have two places of residence; for example, a city flat and a country house. He may regularly live in each. He cannot be physically present in both at the same time, but he may be resident (or ordinarily resident) in each at the same time. People may come and go from the place in which they are ordinarily resident in a large variety of circumstances and on various occasions. It is always a question of fact and degree. ... 
 At first blush it may seem strange to say that a person can be ordinarily resident in more than one country at the same time; but on closer analysis it is not. Plainly you cannot be physically present in more than one place at the same time. But the lifestyles of people vary greatly. Some people in the ordinary pursuit of their lives regularly or customarily live in more than one place, each of which has an element of permanence about it and is not merely a place of casual or intermittent resort."

9 The extracts from Vassis and Taylor above both focus on the conduct and habits of the debtors in question however, in their respective judgments, both Burchett J and Lockhart J also referred to the debtors' statements or beliefs regarding their residency. In Taylor Lockhart J placed significant reliance on outgoing and incoming passenger cards, on which the debtor had recorded that he was an Australian resident, either leaving Australia temporarily or returning from a temporary absence. Although his Honour stated (at 200) that '[o]f course, statements by persons on migration forms are not definitive of their truth', in the context of the rest of the evidence his Honour found the passenger cards persuasive. In Vassis , Burchett J also referred to a departing passenger card in which the debtor indicated that he was an Australian resident, and to the debtor's evidence that he intended to come back to Australia to live permanently after his trip to Greece. Burchett J found that the debtor was ordinarily resident in Australia throughout the two year period that he spent living in Greece.</text>

<tocase>Re Vassis; Ex parte Leung (1986) 9 FCR 518</tocase>
<text>6 Lockhart J's views are consistent with those expressed by Burchett J in Re Vassis; Ex parte Leung (1986) 9 FCR 518 to which his Honour referred. In Vassis, at 524 525, Burchett J made the following comment:
 
 'The question where a person is ordinarily resident is a question of fact: ... It is obviously not to be answered, in respect of any particular time, by asking where that person was then resident . Otherwise, the word, "ordinarily" would have no meaning. But even the unqualified concept of residence is not tied to the accidents of a day; for, as Viscount Sumner said in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Lysaght [1928] AC 234 at 245: "One thinks of a man's settled and usual place of abode as his residence." At the same time his Lordship pointed out that "in many cases in ordinary speech one residence at a time is the underlying assumption and, though a man may be the occupier of two houses, he is thought of as only resident in the one he lives in at the time in question". In s 43 of the Bankruptcy Act , the phrase is not "resident in Australia" but "ordinarily resident in Australia", and it expresses an alternative to "personally present ... in Australia". In such a context it must convey the former of the meanings which I have quoted from Viscount Summer's speech rather than the latter. If a man's home is in Australia, a merely temporary absence will not prevent his being ''ordinarily resident in Australia". It is a question of fact and degree at what point a temporary absence might, if sufficiently prolonged, prevent its being proper to continue to regard him as ordinarily resident in Australia.'

<tocase>Turner v Trevorrow (1994) 49 FCR 566</tocase>
<text>11 In Turner v Trevorrow (1994) 49 FCR 566 at 575 the Full Federal Court acknowledged the possibility that notwithstanding a long physical absence, a continuing link to Australia could establish that a debtor was ordinarily resident in Australia. The Court's statement of the factors that negatived a conclusion that, on the date in question, Mr Turner was ordinarily resident in Australia, is a clear indication of the factors that the Court considered relevant:
 
 'He did not have a dwelling in Australia. He had left Australia with his family, with the intention of spending a substantial period of time - as much as five years - overseas. He was not engaged in employment which by its very nature created a link between himself and Australia notwithstanding long physical absence - such as employment by the Australian Government or an Australian company. He had, for the time being at least, severed his ties with Australia and made arrangements for the winding down (if not winding up) of the company's business affairs.'

12 Accordingly, the question for the Court in these proceedings is whether, as a matter of fact and degree, the respondent could be said to be ordinarily resident in Australia at the time when the act of bankruptcy was committed on 6 June 2005. The applicants accept that they bear the onus of establishing that, as at 6 June 2005, the respondent was ordinarily resident in Australia within the meaning of s 43(1)(b)(i) of Bankruptcy Act .

13 It is not in contention that the respondent was born in Sydney in 1962 and practised as an accountant and as a registered liquidator between 1991 and 1997. From 1998 to 2003 the respondent lived with his mother, Mrs Ailsa Lee, at Ethersey House, Sutton Forest in New South Wales. Ethersey House was purchased by Cape Vale Pty Limited, a company owned by the respondent's mother and Mr Rudi Fabian in June 1998. It was apparently sold in April 2006. In April 2004 the respondent left Australia for Scotland. The respondent purchased the lease of Dunfallandy House in Scotland in about 2004. He is no longer in possession of Dunfallandy House, apparently because the landlord claims that he has failed to pay the rent. Despite that, he persists in describing it as his 'principal residence' . The respondent presently lives in London with his partner who, he says, supports him. Mrs Lee gave evidence that he had returned on several occasions to visit her; that each visit had lasted only 3 or 4 days; and that the respondent did not have any clothes or personal belongings left in Australia. She further deposed that the respondent did not have a rental agreement with her or Cape Vale Pty Limited.</text>
