<text>35 Both Grounds 1 and 2 really seem to involve a contention that the learned Federal Magistrate should have conducted a merits review of the Tribunal's decision. This is the very thing which the Magistrate could not do (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 , (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at [67] ).

36 The third point concerns Mr Rogers. This is a new point. It was not argued before the Federal Magistrate. Her Honour could not have committed jurisdictional error in failing to consider it.

37 However, it seems fairly clear that the appellant attended the hearing before the Tribunal and was given every opportunity to deal with the concerns which the Tribunal had and, indeed, with the proceedings generally. It also seems likely that the handwritten fax dated 28 November 2007 was probably sent after the Tribunal's decision had been signed, although before it was delivered. In any event, the appellant became aware of the decision at about the time that the decision was delivered or very soon after. He also completed the necessary formalities to change his contact details with the Tribunal on 11 December 2007. He appears to have suffered no prejudice as a result of the facts and matters he put to me concerning Mr Rogers.

38 I am unable to see what relief could be granted to the appellant based upon the submissions which he has made and the evidence upon which he has relied in respect of Mr Rogers.

39 In summary, it seems to me, therefore, that there is no error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate which can be reviewed by this Court. Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the appeal with costs.</text>
