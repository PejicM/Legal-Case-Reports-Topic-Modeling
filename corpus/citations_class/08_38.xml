<text>15 In relation to Mr Rundle, ASIC relied upon evidence of asset dissipation prior to these proceedings. The transaction relied upon involved the transfer to his wife of his interest in their matrimonial home. It was described in my reasons for judgment given on 9 November 2007 in connection with consent orders affecting Mr Rundle: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 009 071 968 v Carey (No 18) [2007] FCA 1718. In that case, as I noted, ASIC was prepared to accept the proposed consent orders which dispensed with the continued appointment of a receiver to Mr Rundle's property on the basis that: 
1. The process of identification of the property was complete. 
 
 2. He had been generally cooperative with the receiver and ASIC expected that he would comply with the freezing orders then proposed.

16 ASIC drew something of a distinction between Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in its submissions on the basis that Mr Carey remains a key subject of its investigations. It placed particular emphasis on the disclosure, through the examination process and ancillary Court orders, of his involvement in overseas entities and the movement of certain funds overseas. He was said to have failed to disclose a significant involvement over many years with the entities under his control or acting on his behalf in relation to the movement of significant amounts of money at his direction into accounts under his control, located both in Australia and overseas.

17 ASIC pointed out that in proceedings in the Real Estate and Business Agents Supervisory Board Mr Carey deposed to having total assets with a current estimated value of $1,169,547. In disclosure affidavits in these proceedings he told the Court and the receiver that he had assets of a mere $69,457. One of the additional assets disclosed in the Real Estate and Business Agents Supervisory Board proceedings was an interest in the Westpoint Realty Pty Ltd (In Liq) rent roll said to have an estimated realisable value of $400,000.</text>
