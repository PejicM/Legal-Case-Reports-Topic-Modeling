<text>25 Tracey J usefully summarised the authorities as to the former s 298K in Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 , (2006) 160 IR 1 at [13] [22]. "Injury" is concerned with an adverse effect upon an existing legal right, or "compensable" injury. Prejudicial alteration of position goes beyond that concept. There are many examples in the cases. It is sufficient to refer to Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [37] and [38]; Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; 107 FCR 93 at [17] [22]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 ; and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329.

26 The decision in Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 is a good illustration of where the dividing line might be drawn. Cases on the non-contravening side of the line include Burnie Port Corp Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [2000] FCA 1768 ; (2000) 104 FCR 440 and Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; 106 FCR 482. A case with some similarities to the present is National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90. It dealt with a situation where there was a surplus of employees for genuine business reasons. A "spill and fill" selection and retrenchment process was held not to be capable of giving rise to an injury to any particular employee in his or her employment and could not be said to have altered the position of any individual employee to his or her prejudice.

<tocase>Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/318.html</AustLII>
<text>35 Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127). The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason. This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions. Examples include Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; 108 FCR 90 at [119] [126]; Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 , particularly at [66] [67]; CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326, particularly at [55] [60]; BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; 102 FCR 97 at [48] ; and Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 , particularly at [294] [302].</text>

<text>24 A "before and after" test is usually applied to see whether there has been any injury to, or prejudicial alteration of, the position of the employee by reason of any act of the employer (eg per Evatt J in Blair v Australian Motor Industries Ltd (1982) 61 FLR 283 at 289, 3 IR 176; per Branson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 329 at [127] ). Applying what had been said by the Full Court in an earlier interlocutory appeal ( BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 at [35] ), it was succinctly put by Kenny J in Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482 at [54] as follows:
 "Before s 298K(1) can apply, it must be possible to say of an employee that he or she is, individually speaking, in a worse situation after the employer's acts than before them; that the deterioration has been caused by those acts; and that the acts were intentional in the sense that the employer intended the deterioration to occur." 
The clarification of that approach by the Full Court in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 107 FCR 93 at [21] does not detract from it for present purposes. The same questions must be asked. Here, there should be a negative answer to each limb.

33 So far as s 793(1)(i) is concerned, the affected employees were, or are, entitled to the benefit of the Certified Agreement in common with all production employees. There is no discrimination between employees in that respect. There is no suggestion that persons with the benefit of the Certified Agreement were being discriminated against as compared with people who did not have the benefit of that Agreement. The fact that the employer was, or may have been, advantaged by not dismissing particular employees because of the way in which cl 21.5 worked, is not pertinent to this statutory obligation. The content and effect of an agreement may not always be irrelevant for example, if the way a particular clause operates is related to some relevant form of discrimination. The decision of the Full Court in Greater Dandenong City Council [2001] FCA 349 ; 112 FCR 232 may provide an example of that, although it is a difficult decision as Branson J said in CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [54] , it is not easy to derive a ratio decidendi. The decision in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329 may be another. In each case, the employer had work to be done by those employed pursuant to an industrial instrument. The proposed change meant that the work would be done by those who were willing to take alternative employment pursuant to different industrial instruments or perhaps no industrial instrument. That is not the case here.</text>

<text>30 There may be circumstances where the conduct of the employer towards an employee is such that the employee, upon leaving, can assert that he or she has been constructively dismissed, triggering whatever rights the employee may have upon dismissal ( Westen v Union des Assurances de Paris (1996) 88 IR 259 at 261; Brackenridge v Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 99 at 106; in the case of position redundancy see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; (2002) 125 FCR 9 at [27] ; cf Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corp Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 at [19] ).

<text>30 There may be circumstances where the conduct of the employer towards an employee is such that the employee, upon leaving, can assert that he or she has been constructively dismissed, triggering whatever rights the employee may have upon dismissal ( Westen v Union des Assurances de Paris (1996) 88 IR 259 at 261; Brackenridge v Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 99 at 106; in the case of position redundancy see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; (2002) 125 FCR 9 at [27] ; cf Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corp Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 at [19] ).

<text>25 Tracey J usefully summarised the authorities as to the former s 298K in Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 , (2006) 160 IR 1 at [13] [22]. "Injury" is concerned with an adverse effect upon an existing legal right, or "compensable" injury. Prejudicial alteration of position goes beyond that concept. There are many examples in the cases. It is sufficient to refer to Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [37] and [38]; Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; 107 FCR 93 at [17] [22]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 ; and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329.

33 So far as s 793(1)(i) is concerned, the affected employees were, or are, entitled to the benefit of the Certified Agreement in common with all production employees. There is no discrimination between employees in that respect. There is no suggestion that persons with the benefit of the Certified Agreement were being discriminated against as compared with people who did not have the benefit of that Agreement. The fact that the employer was, or may have been, advantaged by not dismissing particular employees because of the way in which cl 21.5 worked, is not pertinent to this statutory obligation. The content and effect of an agreement may not always be irrelevant for example, if the way a particular clause operates is related to some relevant form of discrimination. The decision of the Full Court in Greater Dandenong City Council [2001] FCA 349 ; 112 FCR 232 may provide an example of that, although it is a difficult decision as Branson J said in CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [54] , it is not easy to derive a ratio decidendi. The decision in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329 may be another. In each case, the employer had work to be done by those employed pursuant to an industrial instrument. The proposed change meant that the work would be done by those who were willing to take alternative employment pursuant to different industrial instruments or perhaps no industrial instrument. That is not the case here.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/513.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In short, whatever the employees suffered by way of psychological distress was not caused by any act of Tristar. Rather, the choice they made to continue in employment was the operative reason for the prejudice ( Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , (2002) 113 IR 326 at [53] and [54]). In my opinion, none of these employees was injured, nor was the position of any of them prejudicially altered by any act of the employer as required by s 792.

32 Even if the necessary injury or alteration of position had been established, a sole or dominant prohibited reason has not been established (s 792(4)). The selection of employees for retrenchment had no scintilla of connection with freedom of association. All employees covered by the Certified Agreement had the benefit of that agreement without discrimination between them. There is no suggestion that selection for retrenchment was made for any reason associated with union membership or non-membership, or union activity or non-activity, or because these employees were covered by the Certified Agreement and other potential persons affected were covered by some other agreement. There is simply no basis for suggestion of discrimination or victimisation in any relevant respect. The employees the subject of this proceeding are only a proportion of the workforce as it stood in 2006.

33 So far as s 793(1)(i) is concerned, the affected employees were, or are, entitled to the benefit of the Certified Agreement in common with all production employees. There is no discrimination between employees in that respect. There is no suggestion that persons with the benefit of the Certified Agreement were being discriminated against as compared with people who did not have the benefit of that Agreement. The fact that the employer was, or may have been, advantaged by not dismissing particular employees because of the way in which cl 21.5 worked, is not pertinent to this statutory obligation. The content and effect of an agreement may not always be irrelevant for example, if the way a particular clause operates is related to some relevant form of discrimination. The decision of the Full Court in Greater Dandenong City Council [2001] FCA 349 ; 112 FCR 232 may provide an example of that, although it is a difficult decision as Branson J said in CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [54] , it is not easy to derive a ratio decidendi. The decision in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329 may be another. In each case, the employer had work to be done by those employed pursuant to an industrial instrument. The proposed change meant that the work would be done by those who were willing to take alternative employment pursuant to different industrial instruments or perhaps no industrial instrument. That is not the case here.

35 Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127). The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason. This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions. Examples include Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; 108 FCR 90 at [119] [126]; Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 , particularly at [66] [67]; CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326, particularly at [55] [60]; BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; 102 FCR 97 at [48] ; and Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 , particularly at [294] [302].

36 There is no causal link between any injury or alteration of position which might be found to have been incurred and the alleged prohibited reason in this case. On one view, s 809 has no work to do in those circumstances (cf CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [56] [60]). In any event, the evidence that was led for Tristar is inconsistent with the existence of any particular reason or intent connected with s 793(1)(i) notwithstanding that I accept that the length of service of the employees was a factor taken into account in not dismissing them because of the size of the severance payment which would have to be made. As I have endeavoured to show, that does not establish that any conduct of Tristar was for a prohibited reason. The manner in which the particular clause in the Certified Agreement worked out in practice does not fall within s 793(1)(i) as construed in the context of the rest of s 793(1), the rest of Pt 16 and the objects and structure of the Act as a whole ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355).</text>

<text>26 The decision in Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 is a good illustration of where the dividing line might be drawn. Cases on the non-contravening side of the line include Burnie Port Corp Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [2000] FCA 1768 ; (2000) 104 FCR 440 and Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; 106 FCR 482. A case with some similarities to the present is National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90. It dealt with a situation where there was a surplus of employees for genuine business reasons. A "spill and fill" selection and retrenchment process was held not to be capable of giving rise to an injury to any particular employee in his or her employment and could not be said to have altered the position of any individual employee to his or her prejudice. (See also Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 , (2006) 160 IR 1 at [29] and [31].)

35 Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127).

It is sufficient to refer to Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [37] and [38]; Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; 107 FCR 93 at [17] [22]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 ; and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329.</text>

<text>36 There is no causal link between any injury or alteration of position which might be found to have been incurred and the alleged prohibited reason in this case. On one view, s 809 has no work to do in those circumstances (cf CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [56] [60]). In any event, the evidence that was led for Tristar is inconsistent with the existence of any particular reason or intent connected with s 793(1)(i) notwithstanding that I accept that the length of service of the employees was a factor taken into account in not dismissing them because of the size of the severance payment which would have to be made. As I have endeavoured to show, that does not establish that any conduct of Tristar was for a prohibited reason. The manner in which the particular clause in the Certified Agreement worked out in practice does not fall within s 793(1)(i) as construed in the context of the rest of s 793(1), the rest of Pt 16 and the objects and structure of the Act as a whole ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355).</text>

<tocase>Squires v Flight Stewards Assn of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155</tocase>
<text>29 There is a respectable argument that an employee cannot be indefinitely denied work to do if work of an appropriate kind is available ( Blackadder v Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 22 ; (2005) 221 CLR 539 , particularly per Callinan and Heydon JJ at [80]; Squires v Flight Stewards Assn of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155 at 164; Downe v Sydney West Area Health Service (No 2) [2008] NSWSC 159 at [410] [431]).

<tocase>Westen v Union des Assurances de Paris (1996) 88 IR 259</tocase>
<text>30 There may be circumstances where the conduct of the employer towards an employee is such that the employee, upon leaving, can assert that he or she has been constructively dismissed, triggering whatever rights the employee may have upon dismissal ( Westen v Union des Assurances de Paris (1996) 88 IR 259 at 261; Brackenridge v Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 99 at 106; in the case of position redundancy see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; (2002) 125 FCR 9 at [27] ; cf Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corp Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 at [19] ). In the present case, that may have included a claim pursuant to cl 21.5. That case could have been pursued by or on behalf of these employees. That course was adopted in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 1613 , (2001) 111 IR 241 (although set aside in the result on appeal Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; 125 FCR 9). Rather, the choice was made here to seek to use the freedom of association provisions to, in effect, act as a means of specific enforcement of cl 21.5.</text>
