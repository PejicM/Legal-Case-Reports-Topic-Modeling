<tocase>Health Insurance Commission v Freeman (1998) 88 FCR 544</tocase>
<text>9 It is not necessary to resolve that issue as, in my opinion, the objection cannot succeed in the face of the decision of the Full Court in Laing v Carroll [2005] FCAFC 202 ; (2005) 146 FCR 511 which concerned the operation of the predecessors to s 169 of the Act, namely, s 83BH and s 86 of the Act as it stood in 2003. The sections cannot be distinguished in substance and the reasoning in Laing [2005] FCAFC 202 ; 146 FCR 511 is directly applicable to the present circumstances. Lander J gave the leading judgment on this point (at [246] [286]). Kenny J agreed (at [82]) but added some observations of her own on this point ([90] [93]). On this reasoning, the powers in question are not spent, even by the institution of civil penalty proceedings. It seems that Spender J would agree ([76]). There is no need for me to repeat the analysis of the authorities to be found in those judgments. I would only add a reference to the judgment of Merkel J in Health Insurance Commission v Freeman (1998) 88 FCR 544 at 558 560 (agreed with by Von Doussa J and Carr J). The argument is weaker in this case than in Laing [2005] FCAFC 202 ; 146 FCR 511 as the proceeding had not been commenced at the time of the interviews. It can be concluded that a decision in principle to commence the proceeding had been taken by 2 December 2006. That is not incompatible with the necessity for completion of the investigation prior to actual commencement of the proceeding. I should add that there is no basis here for an argument that the interviews constituted a contempt of court. The evidence was not illegally obtained.</text>
