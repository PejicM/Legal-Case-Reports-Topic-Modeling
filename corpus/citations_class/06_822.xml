<tocase>State Electricity Commission of Victoria v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 1329 ; (1999) 96 FCR 22</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1329.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The definition of Manufacture-related activity , to the extent of pars (a), (b) and (c) as substantially extracted above, was described in the joint judgment of Heerey and Merkel JJ (with whom Carr J agreed other than to an extent not here material) in State Electricity Commission of Victoria v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 1329 ; (1999) 96 FCR 22 at 29, at [24], as follows:
 
 'Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Item 18(5) of the Exemptions Act deal with a continuum. The common feature is the application of a process or treatment. Paragraph (a) is concerned with the processing of raw materials prior to the stage of manufacture, whether the processor is or is not to be the manufacturer. Paragraph (b) is concerned with the actual process of manufacture. Again the processor can be the manufacturer or someone else. Paragraph (c) is concerned with a post-manufacture stage. But the person who is to market or use the goods has to be the manufacturer. Importantly, the paragraph contains an implicit assumption that bringing goods into a marketable form or condition need not necessarily form part of the process of manufacture of such goods.'

13 The Commissioner recorded that Chapter 2 ( Glossary of Terms ) of the Explanatory Memorandum to the STEC Act employed the term business inputs , though the Commissioner acknowledged that such a term did not appear in that legislation, and pointed out that the Explanatory Memorandum contained the following:
 
 'Road vehicles of a kind ordinarily used for the transport of persons or the transport or delivery of goods or other property will be excluded from the exemptions for goods for use in mining, primary production, manufacturing, printing and other businesses, unless they are for use exclusively in the exemption user's premises or in going between adjacent premises.' 


So much was said by the Commissioner to be reflected in the abovementioned Item 2 headed Primary production activities [R] , appearing in Sub-Chapter 1.1 in turn headed Mining and primary production , and also in Item 18 headed Manufacture-related activities [R] , appearing in Sub-Chapter 1.2 in turn headed Manufacturing and industrial etc . Lindsay drew attention to the exclusion provisions of subItem (3) appearing in the context of Item 18, in so far as the same is picked up by reference in Item 36 headed Subcontractors appearing in Sub-Chapter 1.5 headed Miscellaneous . I will return shortly to the critical operation of Item 36 in relation to the circumstances postulated by Lindsay as allegedly produced of the operation of Item 36 critically (and solely) in its favour.

14 It will have been noticed that each of the headings to Items 2 and 18 bore the insignia [R] at all material times, in relation to which s 9 of the STEC Act stipulated as follows:
 
 '9 Certain exemption Items available only to registered persons 
 
 
 
 Goods are not covered by an exemption Item marked [R] unless the exemption user is a registered person at the time specified in the Table in section 5.' 
 


Lindsay was not a registered person at any material time, being a matter upon which the Commissioner placed reliance, but as I have already foreshadowed, Lindsay's case at least on the appeal was confined to the operation of Item 36 upon the footing of its inclusion of reference relevantly and specifically to Item 18, and upon the further basis that unlike Item 18, the heading to Item 36 was not prefixed [R]. It was that critical circumstance of legislative drafting which Lindsay contended to have been overlooked or misunderstood by the Tribunal.

59 The Commissioner sought assistance also from State Electricity Commission , from which I have cited earlier the passage at [24] of the reasons for decision thereof concerning the operation generally of paras (a), (b) and (c) of Item 18(5). In that case, the Electricity Commissioner as taxpayer used transformers in its business to convert voltage and current so that it could be generated for domestic or industrial consumption, and it sought declaratory relief to the effect that a manufacture-related activity was involved by its use of transformers thus to apply a process or treatment within the scope of the subject subItem 18(5) expression. A Full Federal Court (Heerey Carr and Merkel JJ) held that neither of pars (a), (b) or (c) of subItem 18(5) applied in favour of the Commission. In relation to par (c), being that the subject of particular focus in the present dispute, all members of the Full Court agreed that electricity and electrical power constituted goods within Item 18(5)(c). At 30, at [28], of the reasons for joint judgment of Heerey and Merkel JJ, the following further appears:
 
 'In the context of the Exemptions Act, and in particular Item 18, the tangible "goods" brought into existence for sale in the present case is electrical energy. Energy is a function of power over time. That is the "Commodit[y] of commerce"... which is bought and sold. The commodity is electrical energy, rather than electric current having a particular voltage. On this view, a change in current or voltage does not result in the manufacture or production of a different commodity or different goods.' 


Those circumstances are materially removed from the circumstances of this present litigation.

60 The perishable goods in the form of foodstuffs here involved are to be apparently marketed by or on behalf of a manufacturer of the goods , each of them being a primary producer or manufacturer of the goods , or in relation to whom the goods are wholesaler's-materials goods within the s 3 definition of that expression , or otherwise are within the par (c)(iii) description of qualifying goods within in turn the s 3 definition of that further expression. Lindsay submitted that in the present context therefore, a 'process or treatment to goods' , which has the purpose of bringing goods into and keeping goods in a marketable or usable condition, within the purport of subItem 18(5)(c), need not involve a change in the form, nature or condition of the goods the subject of scrutiny. Lindsay contended rather that it is enough that some action is applied to the goods which results in preserving their marketability or usability in the hands of the manufacturer of the goods, and additionally as here its transportation consignee Lindsay.</text>

<text>18 In the determination of the issues of construction arising on the appeal, being issues on Lindsay's case related to the operation at least ultimately of Item 36 headed Subcontractors , it was submitted by Lindsay that a broad and beneficial approach is appropriate. I was referred in that regard to the Full Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd and others (1986) 18 FCR 29, where Burchett J observed generally at 46, in relation to the then Item 14 and the then definition of aids to manufacture of the precursor to the present STEC Act, that 'the beneficial purpose of the legislation with which this appeal is concerned is as apparent as was that of Div 10 in the cases to which I have referred '. That case involved the exemption or otherwise of sales tax in relation to a conveyor in operation from a mine to a refinery, and in particular whether (to cite the description of Beaumont J at 35) that conveyor should be seen as 'something ancillary to the activities at the mine site and therefore part of the mining operations...'. In that latter regard his Honour expressed the need for appraisal of the character of a conveyor by the adoption of a broad perspective. Earlier in relation to an issue involving modifications appearing in the Third Schedule to that precursor legislation, Olney J (sitting as a single justice) in Commissioner of Taxation v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 479 spoke of the need for 'a robust approach... to be taken to the construction of the Third Schedule, particularly in view of the fact that it is part of a statute imposing taxation... '. That latter dictum was subsequently cited with approval by Hope JA in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 643 at 654, in a context also of sales tax, and where his Honour observed that '[s]ales tax legislation is not intended to stultify trade and commerce but is intended to produce revenue for the government from trade or commerce'. More recently in Dick Smith Electronics Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 97 ATC 5089 at 5094, Carr J (with whose reasons Foster and Tamberlin JJ agreed) endorsed what he termed the need for a 'somewhat robust approach to the problem [as] appropriate in sales tax cases' , and Tamberlin J (at 5096) added that 'a presumption... should be given [to] the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances'. In that latter regard, his Honour referred to the High Court's decision in Downland Publications Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1983) 57 ALJR 286, where at 288, Gibbs CJ (with the concurrence of the other four members of the High Court) spoke of the need, in the context of construing an Item of the then sales tax legislation, '... to look at its form, its contents and its use', and endorsed earlier dictum of Stephen J Rotary Offset Press Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1972) 46 ALJR 609 that 'the test properly is one of popular usage and... that the matter is entirely a question of fact to be decided upon an inspection of the document guided by common knowledge'.

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 87 ATC 5110</tocase>
<text>20 Further as to Lindsay's case as to non-fulfilment of the statutory description of general-purpose road vehicle , the Commissioner drew attention nevertheless to dicta of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 87 ATC 5110, where at 5112, Gray J (with whom Kaye J agreed) said:
 
 'The test for inclusion in this category is that one can stipulate that the primary purpose of the vehicle and its customary use is to transport goods or persons in the course of commercial activity. In applying this test, the concept of "ordinarily used for" equals "whose primary but not necessarily exclusive purpose and customary use is". I say that because in my view the expression "ordinarily used" in the present context cannot be divorced from the concept of the primary purpose for which the vehicle is intended to be used and is in fact customarily used.' 


The Commissioner submitted on that footing that the expression general-purpose road vehicle is sufficiently wide as to connote any type of vehicle which travels on the road, provided it is used for the transport of persons or goods, irrespective of the vehicle not being capable of self-propulsion. Even if that be so, which in my opinion must be at least doubtful, the submission does not at least readily accommodate the statutory notion of a kind ordinarily used . A consideration of each of the descriptions of the relevant goods of Lindsay, at least when addressed individually, does not satisfactorily fulfil the ordinary or usual notion of vehicle, for instance as appearing in the Oxford and Macquarie dictionaries, nor that of road vehicle , so far as concerns the refrigeration unit and the rigid body in particular. The reefer is however at least more debateable as it potentially falls within the Macquarie Dictionary (Revised Third Edition) definition of vehicle as a 'carriage on wheels'.

21 The earlier foreshadowed s 13 of the STEC Act, which is headed Lower level operation of excluded property, and upon which the Commissioner placed reliance, provides as follows (so far as is material):
 
 
 '(1) In deciding whether exemption Item... 18... 36... applies, the exemption user cannot rely on: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the use of the exemption goods, so far as the use relates directly to: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) excluded property; or 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the use of other property so far as its use relates directly to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) excluded property; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (2) In this section: 
 
 excluded property means property that is expressly excluded from the exemption Item concerned....', 
 
 
 
 ... 


The exceptions or non-inclusions thereafter set out refer to Items not here material.

22 The note to Item 36, which I have earlier substantially reproduced, makes reference of course to s 13 of the STEC Act which is not readily comprehensible in its scope of application, addressing as it does exemptions or exclusions from excluded property. Before addressing s 13, I should perhaps observe that at least no aspects of the so-called generally-excluded property , as exemplified in subss 12(2) and (3) of the STEC Act, are here relevant, referring as the same respectively do to 'motor vehicles covered by Item 1 in Schedule 5 (other than vehicles known as four-wheel drive vehicles)' or '[p]roperty... for use mainly for or in connection with the preparation or preservation of food or drink for human consumption, if the preparation or preservation takes place in: 
 
 (i) a retail or catering establishment; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) premises that are occupied in connection with a retail or catering establishment;...' 
 


Section 12 may therefore be put aside.

53 On the appeal in Hamersley Iron , Lush J (with whom Kaye J agreed) said at 607:
 
 'The goods, so identified, are shown by the evidence to have been subjected to a desired change. If a chemical change is sought, the change wrought in the goods is a reduction of variability in the concentration of chemicals throughout the ore. If a change in form, nature or condition is sought, then the goods have been changed in such a way that, if they have not been made marketable, they have at least been made marketable to the better advantage of both seller and buyer. In a word, the change in the goods justifies the application of the word treatment to the mode of producing the change. If it be necessary, it should be held that in the context of item 14 chemical change is not of the essence of treatment.' 


And further at 607:
 
 
 'Even if the decision on the meaning of "treatment" and the concept of what are the goods be rejected, the individual fragments of mineral are "processed" by the blending because they are, intentionally and usefully, re-arranged vis-&agrave;-vis one another.... The Commissioner contended that a change in form or nature of the goods was required, but that is inconsistent with [certain English authority decided in 1957]..., and can be regarded as consistent with such cases as [certain further English authority decided in 1956 and 1966] only if goods the subject of the operation are regarded as a general mass of useful goods together with dirt, waste or impurities, and not the separate individual pieces intended for delivery or sale.' 


Establishing and maintaining a requisite low temperature to foodstuffs, in order to preserve marketability, would seemingly satisfy the present Schedule 1 (ie Item 18(5)(c)) notions above addressed in those authoritative descriptions.</text>

<tocase>Davis v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation 2000 ATC 4201</tocase>
<text>30 Section 5 of the STEC Act stipulates by subsection (1) that '[s]ome exemption Items require the exemption goods to be used in a particular way or by a particular person' , and in the Table thereafter set out in that section headed Use requirements for Schedule 1 , there appears ( inter alia ) under the column heading Use requirement that the ground for quoting must be the 'intended use by the quoter [maintained] during the whole of the statutory period' . The Commissioner pointed out uncontroversially that the operation of the statutory period in the subject circumstances was required by that Table to start at the time when the goods are first applied to a person's own use in Australia (the latter expression reflecting what I have earlier identified as the statutory abbreviation AOU ), and to end 2 years after the time of that first application to the person's own use. However the Commissioner contended controversially that '[i]t is to be inferred from the objective character of the relevant goods that it was [Lindsay's] intention at the time of purchase [thereof] to use the goods as part of or in conjunction with the road vehicles it used in its business of freight transport', being an intention 'borne out by the actual subsequent use made of the goods'. I was referred in that regard to the opinion expressed by Hill J in Davis v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation 2000 ATC 4201 to the effect that the best evidence of purpose will ordinarily be found in the use to which the goods are in fact put by the taxpayer, a principle the applicability whereof was common ground. However that assertion of the Commissioner as to Lindsay's intention understated Lindsay's reasons for purchasing the relevant goods, namely the critical objective of maintaining the temperature, and thereby the condition, of perishable goods in transit.

31 It is appropriate at this point of recording the respective principal submissions of the parties to revert to the threshold theme of the Commissioner's case in relation to the definition contained in s 3(2) of the STEC Act of a general-purpose road vehicle, and the qualified exclusion by subsection (3) of each of Items 2 and 18 of a general-purpose road vehicle , subject to exceptions not here material. The Commissioner's contention was that the words road vehicle are '... alone... sufficiently wide to connote any type of vehicle which travels on the road provided it is used for the transport of persons or goods'. As will be seen, however, more is required to render that broad contention wholly supportable by the provisions of Schedule 1 falling for consideration in the present context . The expression 'any type of vehicle' is too imprecise as such in the context of the complexity of the STEC Act and Schedule 1 thereto.

32 The Commissioner drew further attention nevertheless to the following non-inclusive definition of parts further appearing in s 3(2) of the STEC Act:
 
 'parts, in relation to road vehicles, includes: 
 
 
 
 (a) bodies for those road vehicles (including insulated bodies, tank-bodies, and other bodies designed for the transport or delivery of goods or other property of particular kinds); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) underbody hoists, and other equipment or apparatus of a kind ordinarily fitted to road vehicles for use in connection with the transport or delivery of goods or other property by those road vehicles.' 
 


The Commissioner emphasised in particular the words 'insulated bodies' and 'apparatus of a kind fitted to road vehicles for use in connection with the transport or delivery of goods... by those road vehicles', asserting that the same would cover the refrigeration unit. Whether however the definition extended to the rigid body or the reefer was not seemingly the subject of specific submission by the Commissioner.</text>

<text>47 The first basis was that it was unnecessary to adduce evidence to the effect that it is critical to refrigerate temperature-sensitive goods in the course of being transported; so much was described by Lindsay as 'so generally known that every ordinary person may be reasonably presumed to be aware of it'.

I was referred in that regard to the evidentiary principle enunciated in Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149 at 153, where Isaacs J (with whose reasons Barton ACJ concurred) said as follows:
 
 'The basic essential is that the fact is to be of a class that is so generally known as to give rise to the presumption that all persons are aware of it. This excludes from the operation of judicial notice what are not "general" but "particular" facts... .

Lindsay drew attention in particular to 'subjecting to... physical action...

After referring to Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299, Gobbo J observed at 269 in Hamersley Iron that authority 'supports a meaning of processing that does not require that there be a change producing a commercially distinct article...', and his Honour referred to recent English authority which had 'adopted the view... that alteration of the material was not necessary to involve subjecting it to a process'. That submission was soundly conceived.

57 The Commissioner submitted however that the reasons for decision in Hamersley Iron at first instance and on appeal did not support Lindsay's case, upon the basis that '[r]efrigeration is not a chemical change, and it is doubtful whether it would be regarded as a physical action on the goods of the sort contemplated by the definition of a manufacture-related activity within subItem 5(5)'. The difficulty for the Commissioner is that even if a chemical change is not effected by refrigeration, refrigeration must at least involve physical action. Lindsay pointed out that in Hamersley Iron, '[t]he stacker and reclaimer were machines which physically stacked, and then physically blended the iron ore to ensure homogeneity', which the Commissioner appeared to accept was sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a process or treatment was involved. However the Commissioner contended further that 'the mere cooling of goods during transport is qualitatively different from the process under consideration in Davies ', because there the winding of the yarn onto the cones and tubes was described as 'part of the process of bringing the ultimate product, namely the piece goods, into a form or condition in which they could be marketed' . The difficulty for the Commissioner flowing from any comparison of the factual circumstances in Hamersley Iron , and also in Davies , is that whilst the physical outcome of the process or treatment might be described in each case as more significant in terms of process and extent of change, the STEC notion of applying a process or treatment of goods appearing in the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity would clearly enough accommodate situations of varying degree, depending upon the nature and extent of the process or treatment the subject of application. I have not found the Commissioner's endeavours to distinguish the circumstances in Hamersley Iron (or Davies for that matter) from the present to be persuasive.</text>

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd 85 ATC 4276</tocase>
<text>54 The Commissioner sought to demonstrate, contrary to Lindsay's submissions, that the subItem 18(5) notion of process or treatment did not extend further to Lindsay's advantage, once comparison was made to the circumstances in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd 85 ATC 4276 (Gray J), and on appeal in 86 ATC 4406 (Crockett King and Beach JJ). The Supreme Court of Victoria there held that a machine which weighed, priced and labelled trays of meat in plastic bags could not be viewed as manufacture , and hence that the weighing machine was not an aid to manufacture . However I am unable to discern sufficient analogy between the circumstances the subject of that latter authority and those circumstances here postulated by Lindsay.

55 Lindsay emphasised moreover that the dicta in Hamersley Iron ( ante ) occurred in the context of determining whether certain stacking equipment was used in a process or treatment for the purpose of bringing goods into a marketable or usable condition within at least subItem 18(5)(c), that is to say, in order to put the iron ore as mined into a blended and stored condition ready for shipping. SubItem 18(5) being said by Lindsay to be analogous to Item 14 of the schedule to the precursor exemption legislation to the STEC Act. Lindsay further contended that the foregoing dicta in Hamersley Iron occurred in the further context of determining whether there was at any material time a change in the form, nature or condition of the goods. In that respect, Lindsay asserted that goods cannot be maintained and changed at the same time. Lindsay submitted therefore that on the tests stated in Hamersley Iron to the extent I have recorded, where incidentally the exemption related in part to '... apparatus... for use in the mining industry in carrying out mining operations and in the treatment of the products of those operations', no change in form, nature or condition of the goods is required. The description treatment appears of course throughout each of the definitions of manufacture-related activity appearing in subItem 18(5). The foregoing was described by Lindsay as an established conclusion, fortified by the statutory language having implicitly incorporated the notion of 'keep[ing] the goods refrigerated', as postulated by Mr Cooper in his expert evidence. Lindsay submitted therefore that by prescribing a sales tax exemption for equipment used in applying a process or treatment for the purpose of keeping goods in a marketable or usable condition, the Legislature did not require that any change in form, nature or condition must necessarily occur.

56 That thesis was said by Lindsay to be supported by the example given in the STEC Act, by way of footnote to par (c) of the definition of manufacturer-related activity appearing in the context to subItem 18(5) which I have earlier extracted, and which reads '... applying a coating of grease to manufactured hand tools to prevent corrosion' . It was said by Lindsay, rightly in my opinion, that the application of a coating of grease to a hand tool would not bring about any change in the form, nature or condition of the hand tool, but rather would serve to keep the hand tool in the condition in which it would be appropriately marketed by the manufacturer.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1349.html</AustLII>
<text>58 Lindsay further drew attention to the notion of process appearing in subItem 18(5)(c) as an aspect of the definition of manufacture-related activity, being a notion addressed in the patent case of ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214. The relevant subItem 18(5) expression is of course that of process or treatment to goods , being words of wide import and operation. In the reasons for joint judgment of the Full Court (Lee, Heerey and Lehane JJ) at [7], the following appears, upon which Lindsay placed reliance by way of illustration and analogy:
 
 'Refrigeration involves a transfer of heat. A refrigerant is contained within what is described as a refrigeration loop. Liquid refrigerant, under pressure, is released into an evaporator, where, now under low pressure, it boils, absorbing heat from the space to be refrigerated. In the course of that process, the liquid refrigerant is entirely evaporated. It is drawn into a compressor in which it is both compressed and further heated. Thence it passes through tubing to a condenser. There, still under pressure, it loses heat through the walls of the condenser, condensing into liquid. It is then piped once more to the evaporator. The process continues so long as the compressor operates. In general terms, that is the way in which both refrigerators, domestic and industrial, and air conditioning systems (including those installed in motor vehicles) work.' 


The Commissioner's response was that the foregoing dicta was of no assistance to Lindsay, emanating as it did from 'a different statutory and factual context', and moreover that ICI Chemicals referred to 'refrigeration abstractly as a process or treatment to goods, and cannot assist in determining whether the process concerned was a manufacture related activity process'. I have not found that response on the Commissioner's part to be persuasive, and such as to reflect any distinction relevantly of the authorities cited by Lindsay and identified above by way of illustration. Refrigeration does involve to my mind, both conceptually and realistically, a process or treatment by way of transfer of heat of temperature (as probably reflected in ICI Chemicals above), and I therefore am of the opinion that the analogy advanced by Lindsay was soundly or sufficiently conceived.</text>

<tocase>The Queensland Cement and Lime Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1986) 86 ATC 4771</tocase>
<text>61 So much was contended by Lindsay moreover to be no different in principle, materially or relevantly, from the process or treatment involved in maintaining the slurry in Queensland Cement &amp; Lime Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1986) 86 ATC 4771, being a decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland, in which the following views were expressed by de Jersey J (at 4773), albeit in the context of the 1935 precursor to the STEC Act:
 
 'I should add, with regard to a submission made on behalf of the defendant, that it would in my view be artificial to regard the conversion of limestone power to slurry, and the transporting of that slurry to Fisherman's Landing, as standing apart from the process of manufacture of the clinker. This is, of course, apart from what I have already referred to as a concession on the pleadings. As I have indicated, fairly read, the material before me suggests one continuous process of manufacture, commencing at the latest with the grinding of the limestone... 
 
 ... I should also record my view that the pumps were for use in the "processing or treatment" of the slurry. The defendant's submission appeared to me to involve the views first, that the transporting through the pipes was not part of the overall manufacturing process (the matter with which I have just dealt), and second, that the primary and principal use of the pumps was not in the "processing or treatment" of the slurry being confined to its transportation to Fisherman's Landing. In my opinion, the use of the pumps to move the slurry through the pipes, and manage it at homogeneous and therefore usable consistency, did involve their use in the processing or treatment of the slurry. Clearly such use was and is the "primary and principal" use of the pumps.'

62 The Commissioner asserted that there was a difference in the present factual context between 'maintaining the slurry' and Lindsay's 'activity of refrigeration', both being descriptions framed by the Commissioner, and sought to rely on the following passage earlier in the reasons of de Jersey J also at 4773: '... more than mere transportation is involved: the pumps continue the mixing process necessary for manufacture of the clinker by ensuring the homogeneity of the mixture delivered at Fisherman's Landing...' . Of course Lindsay disputed that any such notion of mere transportation was here involved, which I think to be correct as an evidentiary proposition, and significantly to my mind, the Commissioner nevertheless acknowledged that Queensland Cement and Lime constituted 'a further example of a process falling within the continuum of manufacture'. Of course, issues of the kind here arising fall ultimately to be determined having regard to their own circumstances, as well as of course in the light of legislative stipulations of sufficient operation.

63 The Commissioner further submitted that Lindsay '... only contracted to provide freight services between two points and on any view it did not have any subjective or objective purpose to manufacture goods', and that 'its purpose in carrying out the activity of refrigeration was extraneous to any purpose warranted or contemplated under subItem 18(5)(c) that was directed to a manufacture related activity'. So much seemingly boiled down to perhaps the essence of the Commissioner's case, and was of course disputed by Lindsay as not addressing the substance of Lindsay's case founded on subItem 18(5)(c), for reasons which I have generally as well as specifically outlined already at some length. The Commissioner further asserted that '... there is no evidence as to whether the goods once unloaded, remained at the temperature of the insulated bodies or were returned to room temperature, when for example, they are placed on display in a Woolworth's store'. That latter contention hardly bore upon the significance or otherwise of the condition in which Lindsay was required to deliver the transported foodstuffs etc to their appointed destination, and in any event was not only speculative but seemingly at odds with the thrust of Lindsay's extensive evidence.</text>

<tocase>Ranicar v Frigmobile Pty Ltd and Royal Insurance Australia Ltd (1983) TasR 113</tocase>
<text>64 It was therefore submitted by Lindsay that the evidence, which I have sought thus far to summarise, sufficiently established that its refrigeration unit was used in conjunction with the reefer or rigid body (all three of course together comprising the relevant goods the subject of the proceedings) in order to control the environment in which a manufacturer's temperature-sensitive goods were to be held and maintained in the course of transit, and in order thereby to prevent those goods from spoiling or perishing and to maintain their marketable condition for the benefit of the manufacturer or other principal involved. So much was described by Lindsay as reflective of 'a paradigm case illustrating the purpose which subItem 18(5)(c) was intended to serve'. In any event, so Lindsay's submissions continued, if contrary to that submission, the subItem 18(5)(c) notion of 'process or treatment to goods for the purpose of bringing them into, or keeping them in, the form or condition in which they are to be marketed or used by a person' does require change to occur in order for goods to be subjected to a process or treatment , the in transit refrigeration process applied by Lindsay did involve a physical change to the goods subjected thereto, being a change from that prevailing at the time prior to any process or treatment by way of establishment of the requisite degree of coolness in relation to the goods. I was referred in that regard, by way of purportedly analogous exemplification, to a decision of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in Ranicar v Frigmobile Pty Ltd and Royal Insurance Australia Ltd (1983) TasR 113, where Green CJ said as follows (at 117):
 
 'The question which remains is whether in the circumstances of this case that change in temperature amounted to damage in the scallops. In my view, it plainly did. An alteration in temperature undeniably involves a physical change to a substance and in this case that change had the effect of removing one of the primary qualities which the scallop had their exportability. As a result, it is plain that their usefulness was impaired and their value reduced. That is not to say, of course, that in every case a change in temperature would amount to damage. It would depend upon the circumstances and the nature of the goods.' 


Reliance was placed by Lindsay in particular upon the implications there stated of '[a]n alteration in temperature [involving] a physical change to a substance' . The Commissioner rejoined that when a supermarket places frozen chickens in its freezer, it could not be said that it was thereby engaging in part of a manufacturing process', but the analogy is hardly compelling. Either way, arguments by way of analogy so often carry at least marginal difficulty, but I do not think that the dictum in Ranicar can be so radically rejected merely by the analogy proffered by the Commissioner.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester [1934] HCA 17 ; (1934) 50 CLR 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1934/17.html</AustLII>
<text>65 For completeness, I should further record that attention was also drawn to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester [1934] HCA 17 ; (1934) 50 CLR 225, which related to precursor sales tax legislation, and where it was held that by preparing and cooking fish and chips, the defendant taxpayer had neither produced nor manufactured goods. In that earlier statutory context, manufacture was defined non-exclusively to include 'production and also the combination of parts or ingredients,... except such combination as... is customary or reasonably practical for users or customers of those articles or substances to undertake' . The statutory formula there prevailing is somewhat removed from the notion of applying a process or treatment to goods formulated in subItem 18(5). Each case must of course be considered in the light of its contextual circumstances, and that the retail example derived from Rochester was conceptually removed to my mind from that here subject to consideration.

66 Lindsay submitted in summary in relation to the Item 36 issue as follows:
 
 (i) the relevant goods were used mainly (being of course the Item 18(1) expression) in refrigerating temperature-sensitive goods;
 
 (ii) refrigeration is a process or treatment which was applied to temperature-sensitive goods ( process or treatment to goods being an element in each of pars (a), (b) and (c) of the subItem 18(5) meaning of manufacture-related activity ); and
 
 (iii) the refrigeration was 'for the purpose of... keeping [temperature-sensitive goods] in the form or condition in which they [were] to be marketed [or otherwise] used by... the... manufacturer of the goods', within the scope of subItem 18(5)(c).

67 Upon that footing it was concluded by Lindsay that the relevant goods were each used by Lindsay 'mainly in carrying out... a manufacture-related activity... in the course of a business' within subItem 18(1)(a) of Schedule 1 to the STEC Act, and thus involved the 'use [of] [g]oods... mainly in carrying out one or more activities described in subItem (1) of exemption Item 18... on behalf of one or more other persons (the principals)...' within subItem 36(1) of Schedule 1. As a consequence, so Lindsay further submitted, the goods qualified for sales tax exemption under subItem 36(1), provided that the condition in Item 36(2), which relates to 'use by the principal concerned mainly in carrying out the countable activity at the place at which the activity is to be carried out by the exemption user...' was satisfied. In that regard, it was Lindsay's case that subItem 36(2) 'will be satisfied as long as the relevant goods (or any of them) would be covered by subItem 18(1) and if the applicant's principals used the goods [ mainly ] in carrying out the same [ countable ] activities for instance the subject of Item 18, and further that 'the relevant goods will be covered by subItem 18(1) unless they are excluded either as a general-purpose road vehicle by subItem 18(3)(b) or by section 13 of the STEC Act'. I have of course earlier reproduced s 13, which is headed Lower level operation of excluded property. Item 36(1) requires for its operation that '... either the condition in subitem (2) of this Item or the conditions in subitem (3) of this Item must be met for each activity (countable activity) that is relied on to establish that this subitem applies' , and in the present circumstances, subItem 36(2) uses the more conceptually apposite expression place , and subItem 36(3) uses the perhaps less apposite expression premises .

68 The issues falling for resolution are of course complex, in relation to which both parties provided comprehensive written submissions by way of analysis of the legislation, judicial authority and the evidence tendered to the Tribunal below. In the course of presentation of the respective cases of the parties to the Federal Court, Lindsay appears to have chartered additions and modifications at least of detail to its case presented to the Tribunal below, a course which is perhaps understandable given the complexity and detail of the prospectively or conceivably relevant provisions of the STEC Act, and in particular of the extensive Schedule 1 thereto. In the context of a statutory appeal by way of review of administrative decision-making, an appellant tends to take the opportunity to vary, modify or refine the emphasis and scope of its case conducted earlier at first instance in an administrative tribunal below, and I think that the present application by way of statutory appeal has adopted that course to some extent.

69 Lindsay's contextual foundation for the relief invoked on the present appeal was of course its operations of road haulage and freight transportation which were undertaken as a subcontractor for principals whose business operations involved the production of fresh primary products, and the subsequent merchandising thereof at distant markets in that condition. In relation to the first of the five issues tendered by Lindsay for resolution on the appeal (being the issues set out in [5] of these reasons for judgment), Item 36 of Schedule 1 to the STEC Act was primarily invoked by Lindsay, and so invoked in its capacity as a transport subcontractor of those primary products. It was in relation to its capacity as a haulage subcontractor that Lindsay has sought to establish its fiscal status as an exemption user under the STEC Act, and hence within the scope more specifically of its activities in relation to exemption Items the subject of Schedule 1 to the STEC Act, and to do so in particular in respect of a countable activity within the scope of Item 36 headed Subcontractors .</text>
