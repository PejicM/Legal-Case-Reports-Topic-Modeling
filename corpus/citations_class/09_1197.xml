<tocase>Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship "Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya" and Anor (1997) 79 FCR 71</tocase>
<text>This notice to produce. The provision in the Federal Court Rules in relation to notices to produce is O 33 r 12. That rule provides: 
 
 (1) Where a party to any proceedings serves on another party notice, in accordance with Form 45, requiring the party served to produce at any trial or hearing in the proceedings, or before any Judge, officer, examiner or other person having authority to take evidence in the proceedings any document or thing for the purpose of evidence and the document or thing is in the possession, custody or power of the party served, the party served shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, produce the document or thing in accordance with the notice, without the need for any subpoena for production. 
 

 
 
 (2) Where the document or thing required to be produced in accordance with subrule (1) is not produced, the party serving the notice may lead secondary evidence of the contents or nature of the document or thing. 
 

 
 
 (3) Subrule (2) does not affect the power of the Court to order costs against a party who fails to comply with a notice under subrule (1). 
 
 Some principles have emerged in relation to notices to produce under O 33 r 12 from prior authorities. It is accepted that a notice to produce, properly issued in terms of O 33 r 12, has the same coercive effect as a subpoena. There is also authority that a notice to produce may be used even in respect of an interlocutory hearing. Though examples are to be found of such use it may perhaps require reconsideration at some stage in light of the remarks made in the Full Court in Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH v Owners of Ship "Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya" and Anor (1997) 79 FCR 71 at 93D (Bremerhaven), where the Full Court makes reference to adjectival rules to be applied at the hearing, being those appropriate to a final hearing. I proceed, though, on the basis that the desired use of a notice to produce by Mr Joyce to secure the production of particular documents for use in relation to the application to be heard on 14 December 2009 is, at least in theory, permissible under the Rules even though the application to be heard that day is not a final hearing.
 
I note that in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 , Hely J at 442, having voiced his general agreement with observations made by Hill J in relation to notices to produce, stated:

<tocase>Telstra Corporation v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1398</tocase>

<text>Those sentiments expressed by Hely J were quoted with apparent approval by Graham J in Telstra Corporation v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1398 (Telstra). One finds in Graham J's judgment in the Telstra case at para 44 through to, and including, para 54, a helpful recitation of authority in relation to practice and procedure concerning notices to produce. The Sunland parties do not challenge the prima facie ability of Mr Joyce to invoke the notice to produce procedure in support of his application on 14 December 2009.</text>

<tocase>Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation [2007] FCA 1928 ; (2007) 164 FCR 123</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1928.html</AustLII>
<text>There is, it must be said, something of an incongruity in respect of a party who, on the one hand, challenges the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the substantive proceeding and, on the other hand, seeks to invoke its compulsory process to support an application that that party is making. It may well be that, again prima facie, that course is impermissible: see Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation [2007] FCA 1928 ; (2007) 164 FCR 123 at [10] .

The application to be heard on 14 December 2009 has about it, though, as noted, an alternative predicated upon an absence of success as to the jurisdictional challenge. The Sunland parties, for their part, recognise the practicalities and also the service of the interests of justice by the hearing of the application for the relief Mr Joyce seeks on that day conjunctively rather than in some staggered way. For that reason there is no formal challenge to the ability to invoke the compulsory process reflected in a notice to produce made by the Sunland parties. Rather, they seek to meet whether the notice to produce should be set aside on the assumption that it is otherwise open to Mr Joyce to invoke that process.

That seems to me to be a just way to approach the question of whether the notice to produce should be set aside in the particular circumstances of this case. In other words, whilst I have a particular reservation as to the invocation of the process when jurisdiction is under challenge, I shall proceed on the assumption that it is otherwise regular to have sought to invoke the process.

Another question which emerges in terms of practice and procedure is the absence of a grant of leave to Mr Joyce for the issuing of any notice to produce, be it in the form quoted or in some other form. I say that because the notice seeks to have the documents it describes produced at a time other than the hearing which was to occur on 14 December.</text>

<tocase>BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 834</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/834.html</AustLII>
<text>In BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 834 , Nicholson J had occasion to deal with an application for leave to serve a notice to produce. His Honour made the observation - with respect, an unsurprising observation - that O 33 r 12(1) did not require leave, but that was in the context of where production was to occur at a trial or hearing, or otherwise as provided in r 12. His Honour further observed that leave was necessary in the case before him because the notice sought the production of documents other than at a trial or hearing.

Mr Joyce's counsel, upon this particular subject being drawn to his attention, applied orally for a grant of leave. Thus there are strictly two applications before the Court today. One is that brought by the Sunland parties for the setting aside of the notice to produce; the other is for a grant of leave for the production of documents on notice prior to the hearing on 14 December.

The Sunland parties describe the notice to produce as "a mere fishing expedition". Their submission is that fails to meet the requisite test of relevance in relation to notices to produce. An alternative submission is made in respect of paras 2, 5 and 6 of the notice; that it is oppressive.</text>

<tocase>Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/60.html</AustLII>
<text>The test, so far as the question of relevance is concerned, is one of adjectival relevance. Further, so far as any question of "fishing" is concerned, observations made in the Full Court in Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136 at 143 are pertinent: 
 
 [E]ven if the notices to produce are properly to be regarded as fishing, that concept has undergone substantial rethinking in this Court in recent years. In a number of cases it has been pointed out that O 15A r 6 (discovery before action) expressly contemplates what once might have been castigated as fishing and that it would be incongruous if the power to order discovery much less extensive in favour of a party to a proceeding properly brought in the Court than in favour of someone unable for lack of evidence to mount a case.</text>

<tocase>McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202</tocase>
<text>On 14 December 2009, insofar as the application turns on matters other than jurisdiction, it is evident that Mr Joyce will seek to persuade the Court that there is unjust prejudice to him in the continuance of these proceedings of a kind described in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 at 208. One factor to which Mr Joyce proposes to point is that it is, to say the least, likely that evidence in these proceedings, insofar as it is lawfully possible under our law for the same to be disclosed, will find its way to the authorities in the Emirate. So much is accepted by the Sunland parties.

The Sunland parties go rather further in terms of the particular qualities that are likely to attend them in relation to these proceedings and in respect of proceedings, both civil and criminal, in the Emirate.

That this is so is evident in terms of statements made publicly by the Sunland parties, the contents of which are in evidence before me in the form of a series of Australian Stock Exchange and Media Releases issued under the hand of a Mr Harrison, the company secretary of the Sunland Group. Thus, on 20 February, the Sunland parties have disclosed openly that: 
 
 Information has been provided by Sunland to the investigating authorities 
 

 
 
 [I interpolate "in Dubai"] 
 

 
 
 and the Sunland Group will continue to provide assistance where required.</text>
