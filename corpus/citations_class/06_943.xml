<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Cainero (1988) 15 ALD 368</tocase>
<text>49 The question, therefore, is whether the failure to consider this issue constituted a failure to consider the whole of the applicant's case. In Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Cainero (1988) 15 ALD 368, Foster J said (at 370): 
 
 'It could not be suggested that the Tribunal was under any obligation to isolate in its reasons every issue of fact and record a specific finding in respect of each of them. It is obviously sufficient, in light of the cases referred to above, and as a matter of common sense, that a sufficient compliance with the requirement of considering all issues of fact and giving adequate reasons occurs when the reasons themselves provide a sufficient indication that the ultimate facts to be decided have been fully kept in mind and that no significant area of primary fact has been ignored.'</text>

<text>36 In relation to this submission, the respondent submits that the Tribunal was not required to consider expressly every matter raised by the applicant: see Minister for Health v Charvid Pty Ltd (1986) 10 ALD 124. Further, the respondent says that the applicant expressly disavowed reliance upon the ground of aggravation before the Tribunal (see the portion of the transcript set out at [8] above), and that accordingly he was not entitled to raise it on appeal, and relies upon Coulton and Ors v Holcombe and Ors [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8.</text>

<text>38 The applicant says that the Tribunal should have considered the totality of the medical evidence and consider whether it suggested that the applicant had suffered an ' injury ' within the meaning of the SRC Act. The applicant submits that because of the comments in relation to 'aggravation' at the beginning of the hearing, the Tribunal failed to carry out its review of the material before it, and relies upon Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725.</text>

<text>36 In relation to this submission, the respondent submits that the Tribunal was not required to consider expressly every matter raised by the applicant: see Minister for Health v Charvid Pty Ltd (1986) 10 ALD 124. Further, the respondent says that the applicant expressly disavowed reliance upon the ground of aggravation before the Tribunal (see the portion of the transcript set out at [8] above), and that accordingly he was not entitled to raise it on appeal, and relies upon Coulton and Ors v Holcombe and Ors [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8.

57 In these circumstances, and even having taken into account the fact that the applicant was unrepresented, I consider that the evidence was insufficient to raise this question as a real issue in the proceedings. In coming to this conclusion, I bear in mind the observations of Woodward J in Charvid , where his Honour said (at 129):
 
 'Counsel relied ... on s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , which requires the Tribunal to give reasons for its decision, which, if in writing, "shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence ... on which those findings were based". Arising from this requirement, it is to be assumed that any matters not dealt with in the Tribunal's reasons must have been found to be not material to its decision: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 1 ALD 383; 20 ALR 323 at 353. There could, however, be two reasons for a matter raised in the hearing not being dealt with in the decision. It could be that the Tribunal took the view that, whatever the state of the evidence, the matter was not important or "material" to the issues which it had to determine; or it could be that, although the matter was potentially important, the evidence on it was so skimpy or uncertain that no useful conclusion could be drawn. The Tribunal need not attempt, in its reasons, to deal with every matter which has been covered by evidence before it, or even every matter dealt with in counsel's arguments. The requirement of s 43 is, in my view, that the Tribunal should deal with all the matters which it is bound by relevant legislation to consider, or which it has found persuasive, or which have been urged upon it and would have been persuasive had they been established by the evidence: Steed v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 4 ALD 126; 37 ALR 620 at 621.'</text>

<tocase>Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/85.html</AustLII>
<text>40 The respondent submits that the applicant is intelligent and was competent in the presentation of his claim before the Tribunal, which are factors to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal and the Court: see Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438.

41 The further amended supplementary notice of appeal contains five questions of law to be determined by this appeal (see at [33] above). However, I consider that in fact the appeal raises two real issues. The first issue, which corresponds to the second and third question of law, relates to whether the Tribunal erred in determining that the appellant could not have suffered a subclinical compression fracture during his period of army service.

42 The second issue, which corresponds to the first, fourth and fifth question of law, relates to the question whether the Tribunal considered the totality of the evidence, and in particular, whether the Tribunal erred by confining itself to propositions (a), (b) and (c) (reproduced at [9] above). Related to this issue is the submission that the Tribunal unjustifiably narrowed the scope of its inquiry because of the conversation with the applicant at the outset of the hearing.

52 The issue of assistance to be provided to unrepresented litigants was further considered by the Full Federal Court in Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . The Court there observed (at [27]):
 
 'In Abram v Bank of New Zealand [1996] ATPR 42340 at 42347, a Full Federal Court, faced with an unrepresented litigant's claim that the trial judge had not given him appropriate assistance to present his case, made this comment: 
 
 
 "What a judge must do to assist a litigant in person depends on the litigant, the nature of the case, and the litigant's intelligence and understanding of the case." 
 
 
 We respectfully agree with this observation. Because the duty of the judge varies according to the factors identified by the Full Court in Abram , the duty to assist an unrepresented accused in criminal proceedings is likely to be more extensive than that imposed on a judge hearing civil proceedings in which one or more of the parties are not legally represented ...'

53 The Full Court in Minogue then referred to the decision of Rajski, in which Mahoney JA observed (at 22-3 of his Honour's reasons):
 
 'Where a party appears in person, he will ordinarily be at a disadvantage. That does not mean that the court will give to the other party less than he is entitled to. Nor will it confer upon the party in person advantages which, if he were represented, he would not have. But the court will, I think, be careful to examine what is put to it by a party in person to ensure that he has not, because of the lack of legal skill, failed to claim rights or to put forward arguments which otherwise he might have done.'</text>

<text>52 The issue of assistance to be provided to unrepresented litigants was further considered by the Full Federal Court in Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . The Court there observed (at [27]):
 
 'In Abram v Bank of New Zealand [1996] ATPR 42340 at 42347, a Full Federal Court, faced with an unrepresented litigant's claim that the trial judge had not given him appropriate assistance to present his case, made this comment:

59 Certainly, if it had been squarely raised as a material issue by the evidence (see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 at [58] ), the Tribunal would have been required to consider whether the applicant had suffered an aggravation without suffering a fracture even if the applicant had not raised the issue. However, as outlined above, there was no recent or detailed medical opinion which supported the claim which the applicant now seeks to make. Brief references in dated medical reports were not sufficient to determine the issue in his favour. In these circumstances, the fact that the applicant was unrepresented was not enough to oblige the Tribunal to investigate the issue further.

60 I note the applicant's submission that the Tribunal improperly confined itself as a result of its question to the applicant at the outset of the hearing. I agree that, in the circumstances, if the Tribunal had in fact improperly confined itself, it would have been unfair of the Tribunal to rely upon the applicant's statement that he was not claiming aggravation to restrict its consideration of the issues. The applicant's statement was made in response to a question from the Tribunal. That question effectively asked the applicant to confine his claim, when there would have been no apparent advantage to him (and, in fact, a distinct disadvantage) in doing so. There was no indication from the transcript that the applicant understood the significance of the statement he was making, or that he could make submissions in the alternative. Without intending any criticism, I note that there is no suggestion in the transcript that this possibility was explained to him by the Tribunal or by counsel for the respondent. When an applicant is unrepresented, I do not consider that a Tribunal should exclude from its consideration a matter which is raised as a material issue by the evidence because an unrepresented party has agreed to do so, unless it is clear that the unrepresented party understands the implications of confining his or her claim.

61 However, as referred to above, I do not consider that the Tribunal failed to consider any material issue. The claim now pressed by the applicant was not a material issue before the Tribunal. Whilst it may have been possible for the applicant to have made a claim of the nature which he is now suggesting, it was not a claim which he made to the Tribunal, nor was it raised as a material issue by the evidence before the Tribunal. Accordingly, this ground of appeal must also fail.</text>

<text>51 It is a well-recognised principle that a tribunal (or a court) has a particular duty towards unrepresented applicants who appear before it. The High Court in Neil v Nott [1994] HCA 23 ; (1994) 68 ALJR 509 observed at 510 that:
 
 'A frequent consequence of self-representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy.'</text>

<tocase>Rajski and Anor v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd (unreported, Court of Appeal of New South Wales, 16 June 1986)</tocase>
<text>39 The respondent rejects the submission that the Tribunal 'manoeuvred' the applicant into a disadvantageous position. The respondent says that the applicant at no time requested assistance or guidance, and does not make any complaint that he was prevented from presenting his claim in the manner in which he intended. The Tribunal was merely refraining from interfering in the applicant's case: see Sullivan at 342-3. The respondent says that it was not incumbent upon the Tribunal to frame the applicant's claim on his behalf, and to have done so would have contravened the impartiality and neutrality which are vital to fairness between the parties: see Rajski and Anor v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd (unreported, Court of Appeal of New South Wales, 16 June 1986).

53 The Full Court in Minogue then referred to the decision of Rajski, in which Mahoney JA observed (at 22-3 of his Honour's reasons):
 
 'Where a party appears in person, he will ordinarily be at a disadvantage. That does not mean that the court will give to the other party less than he is entitled to. Nor will it confer upon the party in person advantages which, if he were represented, he would not have. But the court will, I think, be careful to examine what is put to it by a party in person to ensure that he has not, because of the lack of legal skill, failed to claim rights or to put forward arguments which otherwise he might have done.'

54 I note also the observations of Samuels JA in Rajski with respect to the limits upon the assistance that a court or tribunal should provide to an unrepresented litigant. His Honour observed (at 6 of his Honour's reasons):
 
 'In my view, the advice and assistance which a litigant in person ought to receive from the court should be limited to that which is necessary to diminish, so far as this is possible, the disadvantage which he or she will ordinarily suffer when faced by a lawyer, and to prevent destruction from the traps which our adversary procedure offers to the unwary and untutored. But the court should be astute to see that it does not extend its auxiliary role so as to confer upon a litigant in person a positive advantage over the represented opponent.'

55 I have set out above the medical evidence which was before the Tribunal at the time it made its decision. Much of that evidence relates to whether the applicant exhibited vertebral fractures. However, several medical experts linked the applicant's degenerative spinal change to his roping and climbing activities without specifically identifying vertebral fractures: see the reports of Dr Bull, Dr Millar, Dr Ness and Dr Garrick and the 1990 report of Professor Sambrook. The reports of Dr Cameron and Dr Billett, as well as the evidence of Dr Maxwell and Dr McGill, contradict the claim that the applicant's spondylosis was aggravated by his activities.

56 Some of the reports which formed part of the applicant's medical history raised the possibility that his spinal degeneration could be exacerbated without him having suffered a fracture. However, the evidence relating to this possibility was scant and derived from various medical reports which were part of the background to the applicant's claim, rather than the main portion of his medical evidence. Many of those reports were brief reports which were many years old. Despite the fact that the existence of compression fractures was clearly in dispute, none of the recent evidence of Professor Sambrook suggested that the applicant could have suffered an aggravation of his spondylosis even if the fractures did not exist. Further, the respondent's medical experts gave evidence that the applicant's condition was the result of normal degeneration, which is inconsistent with the position now pressed by the applicant. In these circumstances, the references in his medical reports mentioned above would have been insufficient, without further evidence, for the Tribunal to have made a finding that the applicant's spondylosis had been aggravated by his service without him having suffered a compression fracture.</text>

<text>50 In Riordan v Australian Sports Drug Agency [2002] FCA 858 ; (2002) 120 FCR 424, Gray J said at [50]:
 
 'The extent to which the Tribunal is obliged to be proactive is a difficult question. It is possible to have considerable sympathy with the proposition that the Tribunal is obliged only to determine the issues placed before it by the parties. It must be recognised, however, that at least in some circumstances, the Tribunal is obliged to look at issues that are not raised directly. It can only do so, however, if those issues are apparent on the material before it.'</text>

<tocase>Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323</tocase>
<text>37 The applicant responds that in view of the fact that he was unrepresented, it was unfair of the Tribunal to ask him whether he was claiming aggravation. That issue was essentially a medico-legal issue and the applicant, who had neither medical nor legal training, may have been unaware of the legal implications of his answer. The applicant points to the fact that the claim of aggravation had been before the original decision-maker, and that under s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), the Tribunal has the power to inform itself as it thinks appropriate. The applicant says that, if the Tribunal confined itself because of the applicant's answer to this question, the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant, and relies upon Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 342-3 per Deane J.

39 The respondent rejects the submission that the Tribunal 'manoeuvred' the applicant into a disadvantageous position. The respondent says that the applicant at no time requested assistance or guidance, and does not make any complaint that he was prevented from presenting his claim in the manner in which he intended. The Tribunal was merely refraining from interfering in the applicant's case: see Sullivan at 342-3. The respondent says that it was not incumbent upon the Tribunal to frame the applicant's claim on his behalf, and to have done so would have contravened the impartiality and neutrality which are vital to fairness between the parties: see Rajski and Anor v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd (unreported, Court of Appeal of New South Wales, 16 June 1986).

57 In these circumstances, and even having taken into account the fact that the applicant was unrepresented, I consider that the evidence was insufficient to raise this question as a real issue in the proceedings. In coming to this conclusion, I bear in mind the observations of Woodward J in Charvid , where his Honour said (at 129):
