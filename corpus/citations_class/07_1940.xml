<tocase>Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 148 ALR 46</tocase>
<text>18 On its merits the motion for review must fail. There is no basis upon which I could be satisfied that a determination over a Torres Strait regional sea claim area may affect any interest of Pastor Dorogori. In so concluding I have regard to the principles for the identification of relevant interests in Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 148 ALR 46 and various cases in which that case has been followed. A relevant interest, as was said in Arakwal 148 ALR 46, must be (at 51): 
 
 ... capable of clear definition and, equally importantly, ... of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application.

19 I took account of all the material relied upon by Pastor Dorogori. He asserts in reliance upon that material: 
1. That he has a link to the claim area. 
2. That he and the people he represents have a history in the Torres Strait claim area. 
3. That he is the owner of reefs, seas and waters in the claim area. 

The assertion of ownership of reefs, seas and waters is no more than that. No historical basis for such a claim is disclosed. The location of areas allegedly owned by Mr Dorogori and his people is not disclosed. The fact that he may be descended from people who came from an island in the Torres Strait does not, of itself, support the inference that there is some kind of interest which may be affected by a determination.

20 In my opinion the motion should be dismissed. 

 I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
