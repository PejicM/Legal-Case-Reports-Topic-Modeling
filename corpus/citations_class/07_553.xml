<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/58.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The case of the applicant was to the effect that before the power to cancel a visa may be exercised by the Minister, notice of intention to cancel the visa must be given to the visa holder, such service being rendered a jurisdictional fact by virtue of s 134(9) of the Act ( ante ). An initial issue immediately arising is that the subsection does not explicitly so provide, and that accordingly the applicant needs the support of implications arising from the operation of the Act according to its true construction. In any event, it was said by the applicant to follow from the said proposition that a finding of fact necessary to found jurisdiction by reason of the service of notice of intention to cancel may be reviewed by appropriate curial process. I was referred by the applicant in that context generally to the following dicta of the joint judgment of all members of the High Court presiding in Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177:
 
 'If, for example, it is an essential condition of the existence of jurisdiction with respect to a particular matter that a certain event or requirement has in fact occurred or been satisfied, as distinct from the inferior court's own conclusion that it has, there will be jurisdictional error if the court or tribunal purports to act in circumstances where that event has not in fact occurred or that requirement has not in fact been satisfied even though the matter is the kind of matter which the court has jurisdiction to entertain.' 
 

I was also referred to Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (1999) 199 CLR 135 at 148, where the following restatement of principle in the circumstantial setting there arising appears in the joint reasons for judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ:
 
 'The term "jurisdictional fact" (which may be a complex of elements) is often used to identify that criterion, satisfaction of which enlivens the power of the decision-maker to exercise a discretion. Used here, it identifies a criterion, satisfaction of which mandates a particular outcome... The determination of the question whether Collex proposed a "non-complying" development , which turned upon the application of the criterion of "special industry", was a condition upon the existence of which there operated the obligation that the Commission not grant consent... the answer depended, not upon the combined operation of fact and law, but upon the opinion on the matter of the Commission; an opinion based on the evidentiary material before the Commission.'</text>

<tocase>Saleem v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 234</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/234.html</AustLII>
<text>25 On the footing essentially of those submissions in summary of the applicant, the applicant contended that neither the Minister, nor the Tribunal standing in the Minister's shoes, had jurisdiction to cancel 'a business visa' under s 134 of the Act, unless the requirements of s 134(9) have been complied with. Reference was made for comparison to Saleem v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 234 (Allsop J), which involved the exercise of the power given by s 109 of the Act to cancel a visa by reason of ' non-compliance by the holder of [the] visa ' with the obligation pursuant to s 101 of the Act to '... fill in his or her application form in such a way that: (a) all answers on it are answered; and (b) no incorrect answers are given' , and where the Minister had decided that '... there was non-compliance by the visa holder in the way described in the notice' within s 108 of the Act.

26 Reference was thereupon made by the applicant to the provisions of s 494D ( infra ) relating to the appointment of an authorised recipient. By reason of the legislative scheme, the applicant submitted that it was Ms Tang who was the authorised recipient and who was the person to whom the notice of intention to cancel her visa was required to be given, and further that the notice was required to be given to her at 'RM 703, No. 9, Nan-King E. Rd. SEC. 3 Taipei City Taiwan R.O.C', being of course the original address appearing on the initial Form 956 dated 15 October 2001, but at no stage had appropriate notice of intention to cancel been given to her by the Minister at that address. It was further asserted by the applicant in that context that Ms Tang 'was authorised under the 2001 notice to receive on behalf of the applicant any documents or notifications relating to the business visa application made in October 2001'. It was emphasised in that regard that '[i]f a visa holder has notified the Minister that... all documents [are] to be given to an authorised recipient... then the authorised recipient is the person who must be given them', and that 'actual service on the visa holder, without service on the authorised recipient, is not effective service because of the operation of s 494D '.

27 The applicant contended that '... the critical question is whether as at 13 April 2005 (being the date of the Department's notice of intention to cancel her visa), [Ms Lo had] withdrawn the authority to Ms Tang', being withdrawn in the sense that Ms Tang was no longer the applicant's authorised recipient. The Tribunal was said to have relied upon what the applicant wrote on her Departmental Form 1010 sent to the Department in July 2004, which it will be recalled made reference to the address No. 3 Allenby Crescent Strathfield NSW 2135. The applicant pointed out, in any event, that what was written on the Form 1010 signed by her on 7 July 2004 was improperly obtained by the Minister's Department, and 'should not be relied upon as evidence of the applicant's intentions', because that Form 1010 was sent to her at Number 9 Rodd Road Five Dock NSW, yet at that time the applicant was in Taiwan, and that therefore the form should have been sent to Ms Tang as the applicant's authorised recipient. I should interpolate to further mention in that context that on 19 July 2004, what appears to have been the Australian company Saint Island (Australia) Pty Ltd was caused to be incorporated by the applicant and Hui-Sheng Lee, each having the address in the State of New South Wales of Australia of No. 3 Allenby Crescent Strathfield, NSW, as recorded by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It was thus the case of the applicant that the service of that Form 1010 'plainly did not comply with the requirements of s 494D(1) ', and that therefore the Minister 'should not be permitted to rely upon information it obtained from the applicant in a manner not permitted by the statute to support the legality of actions subsequently taken by it against the applicant'. Moreover the situation was said by the applicant to be 'analogous to the [Minister] being permitted to take advantage of material obtained by it in breach of the requirements of procedural fairness'.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2005/685.html</AustLII>
<text>32 The applicant further submitted that the question of whether an authorisation has been withdrawn or varied must be considered subjectively and where there is no direct evidence of intention 'this is assessed having regard to the circumstances', reference being made to Song v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 685 at [35] and Qiu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FLR 120 at [24] in support of that proposition. The applicant observed in any event that even if the issue of withdrawal needs to be assessed objectively, and the contents of Form 1010 are available for such an inquiry, 'at its highest the...form does no more than vary the authorisation to Ms Tang by providing that "written communications about business skills monitoring" were to be sent to the applicant'. Aside from any debate as to the materiality of '[a]ll written communications about Business Skills monitoring...' the subject of par 71 of Form 1010, the fact is that some two and half years or so after the signing by the applicant on 15 October 2001 of the original or initial Form 956, the applicant left blank and hence inapplicable in the context of Form 1010 the fourth box in Part H bearing the description or subject 'Authorised recipient'. To the extent that the hypothetically reasonable person may be taken to have assigned significance to filling out and signing that Form 1010, the evident intention of that person objectively speaking would have been to provide updated information to the Department, upon which the Department would be objectively presumed to place reliance.</text>

<tocase>Makhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 221</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/221.html</AustLII>
<text>38 The further issue next addressed by the Minister was whether in any event, a jurisdictional error would arise from a breach of s 494D(1) by not giving any requisite notice to Ms Tang in Taiwan. Nevertheless upon the hypothesis of breach of s 494D(1) on the Minister's part, the Minister made the following observations and submissions:
 
 (i) it was not in dispute that the Tribunal, like the Minister, has no power to affirm the cancellation of the holder of a business skills visa unless a written notice under s 135 of the Act has been given to that holder within the three year period prescribed by s 134(9) of the Act; in the present case, there was no dispute that the applicant had received the relevant notice of cancellation within the prescribed period of time; the issue arising at the instance of the applicant was whether s 134(9) should be construed as being subject not only to the giving of the statutory notice to the applicant but also to the service thereof upon her purportedly authorised recipient;
 (ii) subsection 134(9) does not in any event require the notice to be given to an authorised recipient; in that regard, the subsection refers only to '... notice... given to its holder [of the visa] ' ;
 (iii) section 135 neither requires that the notice be given to an authorised recipient, nor requires that the notice be given by any one of the methods specified in s 494B of the Act (which I have earlier summarised), unlike incidentally many other provisions of the Act; in those circumstances, the Minister is empowered to use any of the methods specified in s 494B but is not required to use those methods; in that regard s 494A stipulates relevantly that '... the Minister may give the document to the person by any method that he or she considers appropriate (which may be one of the methods mentioned in subparagraph b(i) or (ii) of this section) ';
 (iv) the issue involved therefore becomes whether the enactment of s 494D in 2001 has the effect of so qualifying s 134(9) such that a notice given to a visa holder within time is no longer sufficient to crystallise the operation of the cancellation power;
 (v) the Minister submitted that s 494D 'imposed a duty upon the Minister to provide correspondence to an authorised recipient', but submitted that it did not follow that when that duty is breached in circumstances where nevertheless the principal received the relevant notice, that such notice is ineffective until the authorised recipient is also given the notice;
 (vi) moreover the Court decided in Makhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 221 at [13] - [20] (Mansfield J) that deemed notification to a principal is effective, even if an authorised recipient is not given a document contrary to a provision substantially equivalent to s 494D ;
 (vii) nothing in s 494D has the effect that the actual giving of a document to a principal is deemed not to have occurred if the authorised recipient is not provided with a copy; so much was said to have been held in the course of the analysis of the Full Federal Court (Gray, Whitlam and Mansfield JJ) in VEAN of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 311 ; (2003) 133 FCR 570 at [6] , [9] and [27]; and
 (viii) in the present case there was no doubt that the applicant Ms Lo received actual notice from the Minister, as well as deemed notice irrespective of notification to any authorised recipient; in those circumstances the Minister submitted that there was no failure on the Minister's part to give the applicant a notice within the time prescribed by ss 134(9) and 135 of the Act.

39 As to the reasons for judgment in Makhu , I would observe that the applicant there involved sought to make out a case to the effect that he was not given the opportunity that would flow from the Tribunal's compliance with the invitation stipulated by s 359A of the Act. That section of the Act requires the Tribunal to 'give to the applicant in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, particulars of any information that [it] considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review' . Makhu concerned an applicant who had nominated a migration agent, in accordance with s 379G(1) of the Act, as the authorised recipient of communications under the Act. The Tribunal subsequently sent the applicant a letter for the purposes of s 359A of the Act, thereby highlighting certain deficiencies in his application and inviting him to address them. However, the letter was not addressed to the authorised recipient (the migration agent) at the migration agent's address, but rather it was addressed to the applicant care of the migration agent at the migration agent's address and it was copied to the applicant at his residential address. The applicant deposed as to not having received that letter.

40 Mansfield J observed at [18] to [19] in Makhu as follows: 
 
 
 '18. I do not accept that by nomination of his migration agent as an authorised recipient, under s 379G of the Act, the notice under s 359A must only be given to the applicant by being addressed to and sent to the migration agent. Section 379G(2) provides: 
 
 
 
 
 (2) If the Tribunal gives a document to the authorised recipient, the Tribunal is taken to have given the document to the applicant. However, this does not prevent the Tribunal giving the applicant a copy of the document.' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 19. As noted, the letter of 6 February 2003 was addressed to the applicant care of the migration agent at the migration agent's address and to the applicant at his residential address. Section 379G(1) applies where the Tribunal has given to the authorised recipient, instead of the applicant, the document. Section 379G(2) provides, firstly, that giving the document to the authorised recipient means that the Tribunal is taken to have given the document to the applicant. However, it also expressly preserves the right of the Tribunal to give to the applicant a copy of the document. That it did.'

41 The applicant submitted that the reasoning of Mansfield J assisted her case because 'his Honour concludes that personal service is permitted by s 359G(2) where there has been purported service on the authorised recipient under s 359G(1) as well, (and, by implication, not otherwise)'. The applicant submitted, in the alternative, that if his Honour's decision is construed as standing for the 'broader proposition that deemed notification to a principal is effective even if an authorised recipient is not given a copy, then the decision is distinguishable because the service of the s 359A notice in that case was a procedural requirement in the course of the exercise of jurisdiction'. It was contended therefore that in the present situation, the service of the notice of intention to cancel is necessary relevantly to found jurisdiction.

43 The parties provided post-hearing submissions moreover concerning the recent Full Federal Court authority of Le v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 20 (Emmett, Allsop and Middleton JJ). Whilst the Minister submitted that the reasoning of the Full Court in Le is not consistent with the reasoning of Mansfield J in Makhu , he made the qualification that this is not to 'concede that Le is correctly decided or, to concede the issue'. The Minister contended that unlike the situation in Makhu , Le concerned a situation where there had been no grant of the visa and the correspondence in issue was held to be covered by an authorisation of a person under s 494D(1) in relation to the visa application that was still pending in that case. The Minister further submitted that 'the comments by the Full Court in Le to the effect that an authorisation under s 494D(1) continues in force until withdrawn, does not say anything about the authorisation applying to matters outside the scope of the visa application'; in support of that proposition, the Minister relied on their Honour's reasoning at [29], which is as follows:
 
 'It is incumbent upon an applicant to remain in communication with a person who is authorised to receive documents under s 494D(1) until the applicant withdraws the notice given under that provision or varies it pursuant to s 494 (3). It is not for the Minister to ascertain whether or not an Authorised Recipient has died or is inactive. So long as the Minister is able to give documents to that Authorised Recipient by a method that the Minister considers appropriate, the applicant will be taken to have received the documents. Furthermore, the Minister must give a document to the Authorised Recipient.'</text>

<tocase>Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1000 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2005/1000.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The applicant further invoked Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1000 , where Raphael FM found that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was invalid because of the absence of compliance by the Tribunal with the terms of the former s 379G(iv) of the Act. In reaching that decision, his Honour made the following observations upon which the applicant seemingly placed reliance:
 
 
 '5. The fact that the Tribunal is entitled also to send a copy of the correspondence to the applicant, does not detract from the importance of the provision requiring it to send the document to the authorised representative for the reasons that Mr Dobbie posits. There is a similar provision in subsection 379G(iv) which I believe supports Mr Dobbie's view that the section itself is bent upon ensuing that at no stage shall the applicant's authorised representative be kept out of the loop. 
 
 6. In making the point that I have above, I am sensible of the fact that I appear to be flying in the face of the decision of his Honour Mansfield J in Makhu (supra). With respect to his Honour, whilst it may well be that his decision was correct when handed down, the views of the High Court concerning the importance of mandatory provisions of the Migration Act and the fact that his Honour may not have had the advantage of Mr Dobbie's assistance and his association of subsection 379G(iv) with subsection 379G(ii) permits me, I believe, to respectfully differ from the views expressed by him in that case. His Honour takes a view different to mine as to the work that is required of the word "instead". It appears to me that he uses it to give the Tribunal the ability to choose between which parties the Tribunal may address, whereas I believe that the Tribunal has no such discretion and that, in fact, there are no circumstances in which the authorised recipient should not receive a document.'</text>

<tocase>Le v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 20</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/20.html</AustLII>
<text>43 The parties provided post-hearing submissions moreover concerning the recent Full Federal Court authority of Le v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 20 (Emmett, Allsop and Middleton JJ). Whilst the Minister submitted that the reasoning of the Full Court in Le is not consistent with the reasoning of Mansfield J in Makhu , he made the qualification that this is not to 'concede that Le is correctly decided or, to concede the issue'. The Minister contended that unlike the situation in Makhu , Le concerned a situation where there had been no grant of the visa and the correspondence in issue was held to be covered by an authorisation of a person under s 494D(1) in relation to the visa application that was still pending in that case. The Minister further submitted that 'the comments by the Full Court in Le to the effect that an authorisation under s 494D(1) continues in force until withdrawn, does not say anything about the authorisation applying to matters outside the scope of the visa application'; in support of that proposition, the Minister relied on their Honour's reasoning at [29], which is as follows:
 
 'It is incumbent upon an applicant to remain in communication with a person who is authorised to receive documents under s 494D(1) until the applicant withdraws the notice given under that provision or varies it pursuant to s 494 (3). It is not for the Minister to ascertain whether or not an Authorised Recipient has died or is inactive. So long as the Minister is able to give documents to that Authorised Recipient by a method that the Minister considers appropriate, the applicant will be taken to have received the documents. Furthermore, the Minister must give a document to the Authorised Recipient.'

44 The Minister also observed that the Full Court in Le at [31], accepted that a breach of s 494D(1) may not constitute a jurisdictional error in a case where the principal received actual notice. It was asserted that in the present case that 'the principal did receive actual notice and the Minister relies upon his submissions to the effect that there has been no jurisdictional error in those circumstances'.

45 In reply the applicant submitted that the Full Court in Le made it clear that s 494D authorisation operates until it is varied or withdrawn and that the Minister's contention that the authorisation in this case did not extend beyond the grant of the visa must be rejected. In support of that proposition the applicant made reference to Le at [24] where the Court observed:
 
 'Nevertheless, an unequivocal requirement of s 494D(1) is that the Minister must give a document to the Authorised Recipient instead of to an applicant. Another unequivocal effect of s 494D(2) is that, by giving a document to the Authorised Recipient, the Minister is taken to have given the document to the applicant.' 
 

The applicant further submitted that the 'change of address form in Le (which notified the Minister of an applicant's change of address for correspondence) was not construed as revoking or varying the authorisation.

46 In regards to the Minister's reliance on Le in support of the argument that where actual notice has been received no jurisdictional error arises, the applicant submitted in reply that 'the comment by the Court in Le at [31] that a question may arise as to whether there is jurisdictional error when actual service has been effected is clearly obiter dicta , and does no more than pose the question without suggesting an answer'. The notice of intention to cancel was said to found the jurisdiction to make the decision, and that a failure to strictly meet all the requirements of the Act concerning service of it will be fatal to the jurisdiction which depends upon it.

47 In my opinion, the Minister is entitled to succeed, in the context of the circumstances of this case, essentially in line with his submissions of his case which I have outlined or reproduced. Those submissions seem to me to reflect the correct operation of the legislation presently in force as well as to produce an outcome that gives expression to the prevailing procedural requirements for effective notice of cancellation of visas, and, in particular, business or business skills visas.

48 I have difficulty with the applicant's characterisation of her case in the present litigation as one involving a jurisdictional fact. The situation propounded by the applicant seems to me more strictly to be approached as that of fulfilment or otherwise of statutory requirements for cancellation of a business visa. The issue arising for determination is whether in the events which happened, being events not at least relevantly in dispute, the Minister was required to give the subject notice of intention to cancel the applicant's business skills visa to Ms Tang at the address appearing in the applicant's original Form 956 bearing date 15 October 2001 and headed 'Authorisation of person to act and receive communication', being RM 703, No. 9, Nan-King E. RD., SEC 3 , Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C. Upon that footing the applicant postulated the conclusion that the Minister's sending by post on 13 April 2005 of that notice of intention to cancel addressed to the applicant (of course as the visa holder) at No. 3 Allenby Crescent Strathfield NSW 2135 was invalid and ineffective to cancel the applicant's visa. There was no suggestion raised by the applicant that she did not receive in due course that notice of cancellation bearing date 13 April 2005, her only case being that the notice was invalidated by not having been sent to Ms Tang at her Taiwan address, that address also having been of course that which was specified in the applicant's Form 47BU completed and sent to the Department earlier on 15 October 2001 in the context of the applicant's original visa application.

49 In my opinion, the Minister's response to the applicant's case, as framed in outline in [33] above, is soundly based on the operation of the Act, and in particular on the prescription concerning the giving of notice of a ' proposed cancellation ' of a visa in conformity with the stipulations relevantly of the Act, and ss 134 and 135 and also of ss 494A and 494D thereof in particular. I can see no substance in as well as no sensible basis for the applicant's case. The applicant's details regarding correspondence contained in the initial Form 956 bearing date 15 October 2001 was plainly and unequivocally overtaken and superseded by the applicant's subsequent Form 1010 and Form 956, bearing dates 7 July 2004 and 5 May 2005 respectively, and understandably so given the transpiration of events which had subsequently taken place, including the applicant's subsequent presence at least for some time in Australia. In expressing the foregoing reasons I have reached the same conclusion as that of Deputy President Professor Walker below. Whilst my reasoning is more expansive I think that is because of the additional arguments which counsel for the applicant placed before the Court. I would agree moreover with Professor Walker's approach to reasoning as well, geared as it was in substance as well as appropriately to the relevant events which happened. My approach to the material and circumstances otherwise placed before the Court, requires therefore that the applicant's present application transferred from the Federal Magistrates Court be dismissed.

50 It follows that the present application must be dismissed with the usual consequence as to the costs thereof, inclusive of the proceedings to the extent initially commenced in the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>
