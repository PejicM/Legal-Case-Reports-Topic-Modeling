<tocase>Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1972/69.html</AustLII>
<text>44 A question then arises as to whether a substantial purpose among any other purpose of carrying on the commercial activities of Australia Post satisfies s 7(4) of the FOI Act for the purposes of Part II of Schedule 2 thus rendering Australia Post exempt from the operation of the FOI Act in relation to the list for the purposes of s 7(2) of the FOI Act. In Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617, the High Court was called upon to consider the proper construction for the purposes of s 66B(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1965 1971 (Cth) of the phrase 'for the reason that' in the context of a provision of that Act in terms that 'a person (in this section called 'the supplier') engages in the practice of resale price maintenance if ... (d) the supplier withholds the supply of goods to a second person for the reason that the second person [has engaged in a particular conduct including withholding supply of goods]'. Although the context will, of course, influence the construction to be adopted in any particular given case having regard to the provisions of the Act as a whole, Barwick CJ made this observation at page 634:
 
 In my opinion, it is not correct to so emphasise the participle in the phrase "for the reason that" as to interpret the paragraph as requiring the withholding of the supply to be for one reason only. In my opinion, if the likelihood that the would be purchaser would sell at less than the specific price is an operative reason for withholding that supply, the supplier engages in the practice of resale price maintenance, however many other reasons the supplier may in fact have for not supplying the goods; it is enough if it is an operative reason, that is to say, a substantial reason in the totality of reasons for the withholding of supply. 
 
 [emphasis added]

45 The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (as amended) ultimately adopted provisions which expressly dealt with consequences in terms of the prescriptions in the Act of conduct engaged in for a purpose and whether, in the case of multiple purposes, the prescribed purpose was a substantial purpose. The remarks of the Chief Justice are directed to the general import of the construction to be given to the phrase 'for the reason that'. In Mikasa , Walsh J also took the view that the phrase 'for the reason that' ought to be construed to mean 'a substantial and operative reason' for withholding supplies (page 646). At page 658 of Mikasa , Stephen J said this:
 
 ... common experience suggests that decisions (at least of that nature) have lying behind them a process of decision-making involving the conscious or unconscious weighing of numerous factors, each no doubt of varying weight but each distinct from the others. In such a context each substantial and proximate reason will in my view answer the description of "the reason" in this paragraph.

<tocase>National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1970/51.html</AustLII>
<text>46 In National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13 ( 'National Mutual' ), Gibbs J considered the meaning of the phrase 'for the purpose of producing assessable income' in s 88(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936 1963 (Cth) in a provision which said, 'where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing assessable income and in the year of income [certain events occurred] a proportionate part of the amount of that premium ... shall be an allowable deduction'. Gibbs J at page 18 said this:
 
 The question then is whether the words "used for the purpose of producing assessable income" in s 88(1) and (2) on their proper construction apply to land ... only when it is solely used or chiefly used for the purpose of producing assessable income. The section itself contains no words restricting its operation in that way. If the provisions are literally construed, they apply when the land is used for the purpose of producing some assessable income even though it is used for other purposes as well. No doubt the application of the section might be excluded if the use of the land for the purpose of producing assessable income was so insubstantial as to call for the application of the principle de minimis non curat lex , but it is unnecessary to consider that situation ... 
 
 [emphasis added]

47 In National Mutual , at page 22, Gibbs J said this:
 
 I conclude that the words of s 88 should be given the broad meaning which, in their ordinary and natural sense, they are capable of bearing, and should be understood as including a reference to land which has in fact been used for the purpose of producing assessable income whether or not that was the main use of the land.

<text>48 A similar position was adopted in Hook v Rolfe (1986) 7 NSWLR 40 per Hope, Glass and Samuels JJA at pp 44 and 45. In Secretary to The Department of Treasury and Finance v Dalla-Riva [2007] VSCA 11 , Buchanan JA with whom Ashley JA and Smith AJA agreed considered the construction to be given to a provision which said, 'a document is an exempt document if it is (b) a document that has been prepared by a Minister or on his or her behalf or by an agency for the purpose of submission for consideration by the Cabinet; (ba) a document prepared for the purpose of briefing a Minister in relation to issues to be considered by the Cabinet' (s 28(1) Freedom of Information Act 1982 ). At [13], Buchanan JA said this:
 
 The purpose identified in the relevant paragraph of s 28(1) may be the dominant purpose or one of a number of significantly contributing purposes. Notwithstanding that the objects of the Act set out in s 3 appear to me to warrant construing the rights conferred by the Act liberally and the exceptions narrowly, in my view as long as a purpose meeting the statutory description was causative in the sense that but for its presence, "the power would not have been exercised" it need not have been the sole purpose for the preparation of the document in question.
