<tocase>Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278</tocase>
<text>51 Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts. It was put that by choosing not to adduce any expert evidence, Darrell Lea "effectively accepts the (Cadbury) expert evidence" and that in accordance with Browne v Dunn "Darrell Lea is now estopped from making any submissions that the expert evidence is incorrect". I do not accept this submission. In Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278, a copyright infringement case concerning house plans, Street J said at 286:
 In view of the volume of expert evidence, and the differing views expressed by the expert witnesses, I should state the use that can properly be made of that evidence in reaching a decision in a suit such as this. The decision upon the issue of similarity is an original decision for the court itself. It is to be reached upon an assessment of such similarities and dissimilarities as appear to the court between the plans or buildings under consideration. The fact that one particular expert of the highest authority and of unimpeachable credit is permitted to swear to an opinion on similarity or dissimilarity does not relieve the court of the responsibility of forming its own opinion on this issue. In this sense the expert evidence in a suit such as the present fills a somewhat unusual role. It is almost as if each side calls an expert to argue out with counsel in examination-in-chief and cross-examination the similarity or dissimilarity which that particular expert sees between the plans and houses. By attending to the progress of this argumentative process between counsel and expert the court is enabled to perceive and more readily to appreciate the points of similarity and dissimilarity. In this way the tendering of expert evidence is of value in exposing the facets of the ultimate question to which the expert opinion evidence is directed. But the important point is that, in distinction from the judicial process in relation to expert evidence such as is normally encountered in litigation, a court in the present type of litigation is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to form and act on its own original opinion. 

His Honour's approach would seem to apply a fortiori in a case concerning the retail marketing of everyday consumer products.</text>

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>39 Cadbury submitted that if Darrell Lea wished to challenge or qualify the conclusions reached by the witness on the basis of different factual assumptions the Rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 required the cross-examiner to ask the witness whether such matters resulted in any change to his opinion.

40 As well as Browne v Dunn itself, Cadbury cited in support of this proposition the decision of the Full Court in Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549. That case concerned an appeal from a jury's conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of his second wife and murder of her lover. Evidence was given by a Mr Saulwick of a survey of persons in the Australian Capital Territory as to their knowledge of the appellant's conviction five years earlier of the manslaughter of his first wife and the effect any such knowledge would have on their opinion as to his likely guilt of a similar offence in relation to the second wife. This evidence was adduced in support of an application for leave to challenge jurors as to cause. There was discussion at 557 by Drummond J (with whom Davies and Miles JJ agreed) critical of the usefulness of the survey. In substance his Honour found it was not useful and not a sufficient basis for its conclusion that at least one member of the jury would have connected the appellant with the 1987 killing and, for that reason, would have found the appellant guilty of the 1992 offences. Davies J at 551-552 also gave reasons for his conclusion that the survey questions were "misconceived". Mr Saulwick was cross-examined. It may be that some matters relied on by their Honours were not put to him. For example, in making the point that the sample was drawn from ACT voters and not the more limited population of the ACT eligible for jury service Drummond J said at 557: "This may or may not affect Mr Saulwick's opinion". If anything, the case seems contrary to Cadbury's argument. In any event, Browne v Dunn is not mentioned.

41 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15:
 The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn. See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207 8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119 20. It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. 

After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued:

 The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted.

42 Likewise in Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 236 Mahoney JA said:
 ...failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested. This was pointed out by Lord Herschell ([in Browne v Dunn] at 71). The nature of the defendant's case and the particulars given, and otherwise the conduct of it may make it sufficiently clear that such an assumption is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice concerning the matter.

43 As to the application of Browne v Dunn in modern commercial litigation, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR (Digest) |P 46-183 at 50,323, approved on appeal: J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [103] - [107] .

51 Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts. It was put that by choosing not to adduce any expert evidence, Darrell Lea "effectively accepts the (Cadbury) expert evidence" and that in accordance with Browne v Dunn "Darrell Lea is now estopped from making any submissions that the expert evidence is incorrect". I do not accept this submission. In Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278, a copyright infringement case concerning house plans, Street J said at 286:

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/119.html</AustLII>
<text>6 After hearing further argument the Full Court made orders in relation to costs of the appeal: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 ( Full Court III ). The Full Court ordered that Darrell Lea pay Cadbury's costs other than its costs of and associated with grounds 1-14 inclusive, 17 and 18 of the amended notice of appeal, and that Cadbury pay Darrell Lea's costs of and associated with those grounds.

7 Their Honours in Full Court III noted at [8] that at the hearing of the appeal some grounds of the amended notice of appeal were abandoned by Cadbury, namely grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18, and that grounds 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which raised challenges to substantive findings of the trial judge, were pressed only formally at the hearing of the appeal and were rejected by the Court.

8 On the further hearing Cadbury called its three experts and they were cross-examined by senior counsel for Darrell Lea. Darrell Lea had filed an affidavit by an expert in the same area, a Mr Hall, but did not read his affidavit.

9 Against that background, an initial question has been raised as to the findings made in the earlier judgment under the heading Summary of Findings at [95] to [112] as follows (I have added cross-references indicating grounds in Cadbury's amended notice of appeal which challenge the finding or seek a different finding on the same topic): 
 95 The evidence warrants the following findings. 96 There is wide awareness amongst Australian consumers of the use by Cadbury of a dark purple colour (i) in connection with the marketing, packaging and presentation of certain chocolate products particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk and other block milk chocolate products, and (ii) as a corporate colour. [Grounds 1, 2] 97 Cadbury does not have an exclusive reputation in the use of this dark purple colour in connection with chocolate. Other traders have, with Cadbury's knowledge, for many years used a similar shade of purple. Cadbury has not consistently enforced its alleged exclusive reputation. In relation to its chief competitor Nestl&eacute;, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products. [Grounds 1, 2] 98 Cadbury markets many chocolate products which have little or no purple in their packaging. 99 Cadbury products, regardless of the presence or absence of purple in the packaging, always bear the Cadbury name in a distinctive script. [Ground 2] 100 Cadbury's use of purple in marketing advertising and promotion is, and is seen by consumers to be, inextricably bound up with the well known name Cadbury in its distinctive script. Cadbury never uses the colour purple in isolation as an indicium of trade. [Ground 2] 101 Cadbury products, with insignificant exceptions, are not sold at retail level at premises owned or occupied by Cadbury. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 102 Cadbury's marketing of chocolate heavily emphasises specific products and in particular Cadbury Dairy Milk block chocolate. [Ground 8] 103 Darrell Lea is a name well known in connection with chocolate in those parts of Australia where it operates, even though not as well known as Cadbury. [Ground 10] 104 The names Darrell Lea and Cadbury are quite distinct in sound and appearance (especially with the respective scripts the parties have adopted) and not likely to be mistaken for each other. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury. There has been particular use at Christmas 2000 to 2004 inclusive and also uses at other times. Such usage has diminished and purple has been to a significant extent replaced by blue since 2004. [Ground 12] 106 Darrell Lea did not adopt the colour purple with the intention of leading consumers to believe its products were Cadbury products or that it, or its products, had some kind of association with Cadbury. [Grounds 3, 4, 5] 107 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in premises which it owns or occupies. Other retailing occurs from separate stands or displays in retail premises, such as newsagents, pharmacies, convenience stores and video stores. Darrell Lea has only a minor presence in supermarkets and only, in the past, to a very limited and transient extent in the major chains. Its products are not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 108 Darrell Lea's marketing gives less emphasis to particular products than does Cadbury. [Grounds 8, 10, 11, 12] 109 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 110 Darrell Lea uses its name in a distinctive script widely and consistently in marketing, packaging and point of sale presentation. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 111 Colour recognition or attraction can play an important part in consumer decisions to purchase chocolate. [Ground 9] 112 Consumer decisions to purchase chocolate are often made quickly and on impulse but not necessarily irrationally. Price and brand recognition can play an important part. [Ground 9]

10 After analysing Cadbury's case I reached the following conclusions (again, references to the grounds in the amended notice of appeal are inserted):
 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. [Grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] They have distinct identities in the market place. [Grounds 11, 12] Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur.</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/102.html</AustLII>
<text>4 Cadbury brought a motion to the Full Court seeking an order that the previous order remitting the matter to the trial judge for further hearing be varied to provide that the matter be remitted to the trial judge for a new trial: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102 ( Full Court II ). In rejecting Cadbury's motion the Full Court said:
 4 We do not understand Cadbury to be suggesting that an order remitting the matter to the primary judge for a further hearing was not open to the Court. Cadbury's motion appears to have been prompted by a directions hearing before the primary judge on 12 June 2007 during which his Honour indicated his understanding that the effect of the Full Court's order was that there would be a further hearing at which the excluded evidence would be adduced, but that that would be the extent of the further hearing. It would seem that that was not Cadbury's understanding of the effect of the Full Court's order of 21 May 2007. 5 It is clear that Cadbury sought a new trial as part of the relief claimed in the appeal. On the hearing of the appeal, one of the issues was whether, even if there had been an error on the part of the primary judge in excluding evidence there was nevertheless no miscarriage of justice and the orders made by the primary judge should therefore stand. The Full Court rejected that contention. The Court concluded that it could not be said that the disputed evidence was of so little weight that it could not influence the result of a new trial, so as to produce a different result (at [111]). 6 However, the Court did not consider that a new trial was justified. Rather, the Court was of the view that justice would be served by a further hearing before the primary judge, at which Cadbury would have another opportunity of adducing the disputed evidence. 7 The proceeding was remitted on the basis that it would be before the primary judge as though the case were part heard. Thus, it would be a matter for the primary judge to determine the extent to which, after entertaining all proper objections and making rulings on such objections, additional or further evidence should be admitted. That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence. 8 We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections. That would be an aspect of the management of the further hearing by the primary judge in the same way as it would have been had his Honour not rejected the disputed evidence in its entirety. That is to say, it would be for counsel for Darrell Lea to make such objections to the admissibility of the disputed evidence on formal grounds as they may consider appropriate. If, in the exercise of his discretion, the primary judge were to permit Cadbury the opportunity of adducing further evidence to overcome any objections, that would be a matter entirely for his Honour at the further hearing. 9 It is conceivable that, after hearing proper objections from Darrell Lea, none of the disputed evidence will be admitted. We do not, by that comment, indicate any view about the outcome of any objections one way or the other, except to the extent that we indicated the principles to be applied in our reasons of 21 May 2007. It is, of course, conceivable, and we make no comment one way or the other as to whether it is likely, that is Honour would still reject the disputed evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act . That is entirely a matter for the primary judge. 10 Further, there would be no reason why the primary judge should entertain any contention that he should reverse earlier rulings made by him that were not in any way dependant upon the rejection of the disputed evidence. His Honour should be in a position to conduct the further hearing as though he had admitted such of the disputed evidence as his Honour finds to be admissible after considering appropriate objections. 11 In so far as we referred to "a further trial" (at [129]) or "the new trial judge" (at [130]) we should be understood as having referred to a further hearing by the primary judge along those lines. As we said (at [114]): 
 
 In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing. Of course, if the primary judge were prepared to entertain a submission that he would not be able to bring an open mind to the resolution of the proceeding in the light of his Honour's earlier rulings both on the disputed evidence and in the final decision, it would be a matter for his Honour to decide whether he considered it was appropriate for the proceeding to be referred to another judge for a retrial ab initio. 
 
 12 Similarly, if the primary judge were persuaded that the conduct of the hearing to date was such that the admission of any part of the disputed evidence that his Honour was disposed to admit would cause injustice, it would be a matter for his Honour as to whether the trial should, for that reason, be aborted. The primary judge should be regarded as being in the same position as he would have been in had he not made the ruling of 31 March 2006. 
It is clear from the context that the term "rulings" in [10] is a reference to rulings on evidence and procedure and not substantive findings, as to which see [11]-[12] below.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/133.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Nevertheless s 80 of the Evidence Act deals only with the admissibility of evidence. It does not affect the approach to particular kinds of evidence in particular categories of cases. In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] in the context of a s 52 and passing off case (and well after the introduction of the Evidence Act ), Branson J, after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection, said:
 However, I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case, which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public, I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance. This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts. It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way. I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely 'impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight. These observations are not intended in any way to belittle the importance of market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour in other types of cases and for other purposes.</text>

<text>49 In Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] , a Full Court of this Court cited the above passage with approval and continued:
 22 Consideration of these difficulties shows the practical wisdom of the firm rule that the likelihood of conduct being misleading or deceptive is a question for the tribunal of fact and not for any witness to decide: General Electric Co (USA) v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729 at 738 per Lord Diplock, applied in a s 52 context by Gummow J, with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed, in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387. 23 Lord Diplock points out in General Electric that a different rule applies in the case of sales not to the general public but in specialised markets concerning persons engaged in a particular trade. In the present case the relevant market is that in which the consumers are business users of domain names. Such users constitute large sections of the public and are not participants in a specialised market in the sense discussed by Lord Diplock.

87 In its written submissions Cadbury cited numerous decisions which were said to involve facts or issues similar to the present case and statements of judges about the facts in those cases. For its part, Darrell Lea sought to draw different messages from those, and other, cases and statements. Without wishing to disparage the industry of counsel, I did not find this exercise particularly helpful. I repeat the statement of Lord Oliver in Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7, quoted in the earlier judgment at [120]. Mutatis mutandis , similar considerations apply to the trade practices claims. As was pointed out in Domain Names and Interlego (see [49]-[50] above), these are jury questions. A jury would not be asked to consider what was said by judges in other cases because a jury has to apply legal principle to the facts before it, and no other facts.</text>

<text>49 In Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] , a Full Court of this Court cited the above passage with approval and continued:
 22 Consideration of these difficulties shows the practical wisdom of the firm rule that the likelihood of conduct being misleading or deceptive is a question for the tribunal of fact and not for any witness to decide: General Electric Co (USA) v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729 at 738 per Lord Diplock, applied in a s 52 context by Gummow J, with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed, in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387. 23 Lord Diplock points out in General Electric that a different rule applies in the case of sales not to the general public but in specialised markets concerning persons engaged in a particular trade.

50 In Interlego AG v Croner Trader Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 Gummow J also said at 387:
 The issue of whether consumers have been or are likely to be deceived was described by Lord Diplock as a "jury question": General Electric Co (of USA) v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729; [1972] 2 All ER 507. His Lordship said (at 738; 515): 

 
 
 [W]here goods are sold to the general public for consumption or domestic use, the question whether such buyers would be likely to be deceived or confused by the use of the trademark is a 'jury question'. By that I mean: that if the issue had now, as formerly, to be tried by a jury, who as members of the general public would themselves be potential buyers of the goods, they would be required not only to consider any evidence of other members of the public which had been adduced but also to use their own common sense and to consider whether they would themselves be likely to be deceived or confused. 
 


 
 
 The question does not cease to be a 'jury question' when the issue is tried by a judge alone or on appeal by a plurality of judges. The judge's approach to the question should be the same as that of a jury. He, too, would be a potential buyer of the goods. He should, of course, be alert to the danger of allowing his own idiosyncratic knowledge or temperament to influence his decision, but the whole of his training in the practice of the law should have accustomed him to this, and this should provide the safety which in the case of a jury is provided by their number. That in issues of this kind judges are entitled to give effect to their own opinions as to the likelihood of deception or confusion and, in doing so, are not confined to the evidence of witnesses called at the trial is well established by the decisions of this House itself.

87 In its written submissions Cadbury cited numerous decisions which were said to involve facts or issues similar to the present case and statements of judges about the facts in those cases. For its part, Darrell Lea sought to draw different messages from those, and other, cases and statements.

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>58 Cadbury submitted that the failure of Darrell Lea to adduce evidence (expert or lay) as to the effect that third party use of purple has adversely impacted Cadbury's reputation in Cadbury purple meant that the Court ought to draw a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference that any evidence it might have sought to adduce would not have assisted its case in this respect. I do not agree. There was substantial evidence of the fact of third party usage given by Darrell Lea's Mr Michael Lea (earlier judgment [52]-[54]) and evidence of Cadbury's "Co-existence Agreement" with Nestl&eacute; under which Cadbury agreed not to object to Nestl&eacute;'s use of get-ups for Violet Crumble (a chocolate-coated honeycomb bar which might be said to verge on the iconic), Wonka, Quality Street and Polly Waffle, all of which featured purple ([55]-[56]). For its part Cadbury adduced evidence of its efforts to restrain third party usage, which met with mixed success ([57]-[67]). There was evidence of actual third party usage in the present case sufficient for the Court to make its own findings.

59 Mr Riches said that the third party products "did not come close to dominating the chocolate confectionery market in the same way as Cadbury Dairy Milk" and that no other brand consistently used purple as a "brand identity element" in promotional campaigns. Dr Stavros thought that purple used with Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble were "product specific instances of the use of a colour, rather than a corporate or master branding or mega branding". However, the lack of specialised knowledge of the confectionery market of these witnesses has already been noted.

60 Dr Stavros said that some consumers would pick up a Violet Crumble, see the Nestl&eacute; brand and "make the connection between those brands [ie Nestl&eacute; and Cadbury] and be aware that there's a distinction between those organisations". He continued:
 There's a scope though for other consumers to see the purple, relate that to the Cadbury brand and either believe that the product comes from Cadbury, or that there is some association between those organisations, I think that's possible it's very possible. 

Dr Stavros' hypothesis, involving as it does a very well known non-Cadbury manufacturer and a very well known non-Cadbury product, is speculative and quite unrealistic.</text>

<tocase>Parkdale Custom Built Furniture v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/44.html</AustLII>
<text>88 One additional aspect of trade practices law which should be mentioned is that conduct which results in mere confusion, or consumers being "caused to wonder", does not amount to misleading and deceptive conduct within the meaning of the statute. The position is to be distinguished from that in trade mark law. In Parkdale Custom Built Furniture v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198 Gibbs CJ said:
 In McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd v McDonalds System of Australia Pty Ltd (1980) 49 FLR 455 it was rightly held by Smithers J and by Fisher J that to prove a breach of s 52 it is not enough to establish that the conduct complained of was confusing or caused people to wonder whether two products may have come from the same source, and that Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 , a decision on the Trade Marks Act 1905 (Cth), as amended, is distinguishable. I need not add to what their Honours said on this subject (1980) 49 FLR, at pp 458-459, 475-476. 

Likewise in Taco Co (Aust) Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 201 Deane and Fitzgerald JJ said:
 Conduct which produces or contributes to confusion or uncertainty may or may not be misleading or deceptive for the purposes of s 52. In some circumstances, conduct could conceivably be properly categorized as misleading or deceptive for the very reason that it represents that confusion or uncertainty exists where, in truth, there is no proper room for either. Ordinarily, however, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish that conduct is of the type described in s 52. The question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52. 

Much of Dr Gibbs' opinions as to misinference and misassociation would seem to be examples of the "caused to wonder" reaction by consumers (and others such as employees and competitors). Insofar as they are, they would seem to raise matters outside the purview of the Trade Practices Act or the tort of passing off, even if they are matters of commercial concern to Cadbury.</text>

<tocase>Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1</tocase>
<text>41 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15:
 The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn. See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207 8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119 20. It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. 

After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued:

 The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted.</text>

 ...failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested. This was pointed out by Lord Herschell ([in Browne v Dunn] at 71).
