<tocase>Allstate Life Insurance Co and Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 1459</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1995/1459.html</AustLII>
<text>In Allstate Life Insurance Co and Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 1459 , where the respondents had been successful in meeting appeals dealing with a discrete question and the Court had ordered that the appellants pay the respondents' costs of the appeals, Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ observed: 
 
 [4] The proceeding has been set down for hearing commencing on 18 March 1996 and unless settled may subsist for a substantial time. The litigation is complex. It is unlikely that final judgment will be given until late 1996 or even later. The successful parties to the appeals before this Court will therefore, in the ordinary course of events, not recover their costs for a long time. 
 

 
 
 [5] It would be wrong if the successful parties do not enjoy the fruits of their order for costs for such a long time. The parties entitled to the benefit of the order for costs which this Court has made in appeals from interlocutory orders should not be deprived of that benefit until the case has been finally disposed of.

In my view similar principles apply in this case. The respondents, who were successful in respect of issues arising in relation to Pt A para 7 of the application, have incurred costs to which they are now entitled. The applicant's claims in the substantive proceedings will not be heard until early 2010. There is no justification for leaving a determination of costs arising from the separate hearing of Pt A para 7 of the application until that time. 2. Basis of costs award

The respondents submit that they should both be entitled to an award of costs on an indemnity basis. Mr Troy Thomas

In relation to Mr Troy Thomas, the applicant submits that there was no basis for a claim that Mr Thomas had incurred separate costs and in any case that an award of costs should not be on an indemnity basis. However the respondents submit that:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/536.html</AustLII>
<text>It is well settled that the purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 , De Alwis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 77. Although the usual rule is that costs be awarded against the unsuccessful party on a party-party basis, the Court has a discretion to award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases: Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 231-234. Circumstances where the Court may consider awarding costs on an indemnity basis include:

As I observed in the judgment, notwithstanding that Mr Troy Thomas was required to meet the proceedings, HFAT did not open a case against him, nor did HFAT produce evidence in support of its claims against him in terms of Pt A para 7. Indeed, the applicant conceded in its submissions that, given the state of the evidence, there was no sufficient basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to this aspect of the application. I consider that the claims against Mr Troy Thomas in terms of Pt A para 7 were of the nature described in Colgate-Palmolive (1993) 46 FCR and InterTAN [2005] FCAFC 54 , namely allegations which ought never to have been made, and which had no chance of success. Taking this view, and particularly in light of the fact that Mr Troy Thomas was required to take steps to defend himself against the applicant's case including engaging legal representation, I consider that the case against Mr Troy Thomas exhibits special features justifying the Court exercising its discretion to order costs incurred by him to be paid on an indemnity basis.

<tocase>Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas (No 2) [2009] FCA 1084</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1084.html</AustLII>
<text>In Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas (No 2) [2009] FCA 1084 ("the judgment") I dismissed the claim of the applicant. The applicant sought relief pursuant to Pt A para 7 of the application filed 13 May 2007. After delivering judgment I ordered the parties to file and serve separate submissions as to costs incurred in respect of hearings leading to the judgment.

Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court: s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Two clear issues for determination arise from these submissions. They are: Whether costs should be reserved until the conclusion of the substantive proceedings; and In light of the concession of the applicant that costs should follow the event whether the respondents' costs should be awarded on a party-party basis or an indemnity basis. 1. Should costs be reserved?

The applicant has submitted that costs should be reserved to the trial of the balance of the proceedings, when the Court will have a more extensive understanding of the parties' conduct, and will be able to form a more informed and balanced view of where costs should ultimately fall.</text>
