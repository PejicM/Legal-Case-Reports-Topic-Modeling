<text>25 This application is made under s 1337H of the Corporations Act . It is not suggested that there is a residual common law discretion to stay proceedings brought in defiance of the exclusive jurisdiction clause and that concession by Hood is, in my opinion, correct: see World Firefighters Games Brisbane, 2002 v World Firefighters Games Western Australia Inc [2001] QSC 164. The existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause is a relevant consideration in terms of the discretion to transfer, and in some cases is a very weighty matter: see Slater &amp; Gordon Pty Ltd v Porteous [2005] VSC 398.</text>
