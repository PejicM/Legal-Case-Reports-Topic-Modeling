 JUDGE: SACKVILLE J DATE: 5 MAY 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY 
 RULING ON EVIDENCE 
 
 THE EXPERT REPORT 
 
1 Objection has been taken to the tender of a report prepared by Mr Roy A Salter. Mr Salter is a Principal of the Salter Group and is based in the Group's Los Angeles office, where he directs the firm's overall practice and project management efforts. The Salter Group is said to be:
 
 'an independent financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the entertainment and media industry offering economic analysis, investment banking support, corporate development and other advisory services'.

26 In HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 ; (1999) 197 CLR 414, Gleeson CJ pointed out (at [39]) that the provisions of s 79 of the Evidence Act :
 
 'will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question.' 
 

His Honour also observed (at [44]) that:
 
 'in trials before judges alone, as well as in trials by jury, it is important that the opinions of expert witnesses be confined, in accordance with s 79 , to opinions which are wholly or substantially based on their specialised knowledge. Experts who venture "opinions" (sometimes merely their own inference of fact), outside their field of specified knowledge may invest those opinions with a spurious appearance of authority, and legitimate processes of fact-finding may be subverted.'</text>

 JUDGE: SACKVILLE J DATE: 5 MAY 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY 
 RULING ON EVIDENCE 
 
 THE EXPERT REPORT 
 
1 Objection has been taken to the tender of a report prepared by Mr Roy A Salter. Mr Salter is a Principal of the Salter Group and is based in the Group's Los Angeles office, where he directs the firm's overall practice and project management efforts. The Salter Group is said to be:
 
 'an independent financial and strategic advisory firm dedicated to the entertainment and media industry offering economic analysis, investment banking support, corporate development and other advisory services'.

27 Similarly, in Ocean Marine Mutual Insurance Association (Europe) OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1463 ; (2000) 120 FCR 146, the Full Court observed (at [23]) that the:
 
 'further requirement [in s 79] that an opinion be based on specialised knowledge would normally be satisfied by the person who expresses the opinion demonstrating the reasoning process by which the opinion was reached. Thus, a report in which an opinion is recorded should expose the reasoning of its author in a way that would demonstrate that the opinion is based on particular specialised knowledge.' (Emphasis in original.)

28 In my opinion, the report in its present form does not meet the requirements of s 79 of the Evidence Act . In particular, it is impossible to ascertain whether the opinions expressed by Mr Salter quantifying losses sustained by Seven because of its inability to pursue an IMC strategy reflect his specialised knowledge, based on his training, study or experience. The report must therefore be rejected.

29 Because Mr Sheahan SC foreshadowed the possibility that Seven would seek to adduce further evidence from Mr Salter to cure the evidentiary defects in his report, I think it is appropriate to make some additional comments.</text>
