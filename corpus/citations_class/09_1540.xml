<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>It is trite law to say that I have a discretion in relation to costs pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the only constraint being, speaking generally, that I am obliged to exercise that discretion judicially. The usual rule in relation to costs is that costs follow the event, in the absence of special reasons to the contrary: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235.</text>

<tocase>Fetherson v Peninsula Health (No 2) [2004] FCA 594 ; (2004) 137 FCR 262</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/594.html</AustLII>
<text>A departure from the usual rule requires a valid, special reason. When considering the exercise of discretion in relation to the exercise of costs, it is frequently submitted that other cases bear upon the issue, and provide guidance as to how those costs should be ordered, but it has been established in a number of cases that other cases are not particularly helpful where the facts are quite different, and I adopt the observations of Heerey J in Fetherson v Peninsula Health (No 2) [2004] FCA 594 ; (2004) 137 FCR 262 at par [12].

The defendant has submitted that the plaintiffs should pay his costs as he has succeeded on the whole of the claim in the sense that he is not liable to pay any of the amount claimed by the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs make a quite different submission. They submit that the defendant should pay their costs as they were successful in relation to all the substantive issues. The plaintiffs point to the fact that they succeeded in establishing the issues that the company was insolvent, that there were reasonable grounds to suspect insolvency and that the defendant was aware of those reasonable grounds. They also established that a reasonable person in a like position to the defendant would have been so aware of those reasonable grounds, and they succeeded in relation to the defences available under s 588H(2), which were not made out.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/6.html</AustLII>
<text>The situation which has arisen in relation to the interlocutory process is that at the time there was a reasonable basis for bringing it. That basis has now disappeared as a result of subsequent events. It is not appropriate that the Court try the whole of that interlocutory proceeding simply for the purpose of determining the costs, and there is clear authority for the proposition that, unless in those circumstances it is abundantly clear that the interlocutory process would have clearly succeeded or clearly failed, there should be no order as to costs in relation to it. I adopt and follow the reasoning of McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 , Finkelstein J in Gribbles Pathology Ltd v Health Insurance Commission (1997) 80 FCR 284 and Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194. 
 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Goldberg.
