<text>15 Third, at the time when the Draft Report was prepared, the Act contained no statutory requirement that it contain reasons. Subsection 106KD(1A), which provides that 'a draft report must set out the reasons for the preliminary findings' did not come into force until 1 January 2003. It does not apply to the present case see Item 118(1) Schedule 1, Health Insurance Amended (Professional Services Review and Other Matters) Act 2002 (Cth). Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which operates only where there is such a statutory requirement, did not apply to the Draft Report. Dr Mathews' contention to the contrary was rejected in Dimian v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCA 1615 at [78] [80] per Jacobson J. I agree with his Honour's view.

16 In any event, this ground cannot be sustained because the Draft Report does contain reasons see ground 4 below.

17 Ground 4 is as follows:
 
 ' [The Committee] failed to observe procedures that it was required to observe by law (ADJR Act, s 5(1)(b) or 5 (1)(e)), in the making of its Final Report in that it failed to make or set out: 
 
 
 
 (a) Findings or sufficient findings on material questions of fact; and it 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Failed to refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based (the Act, s 106L and Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , s 25D) and/or it 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Failed to expose its reasons or sufficient reasons for making its ultimate conclusions.'</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/431.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The Committee was required to prepare a Draft Report setting out its preliminary findings subs 106KD(1) of the Act. It was submitted that the fact that those views were unfavourable to Dr Mathews is not, of itself, evidence of bias or pre-judgment: see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431 at [11] . That is undoubtedly correct.

32 The Committee discussed Dr Mathews' submissions on the Draft Report in the Final Report at [95] [100]. It declared at [96] that after careful consideration of the submissions, it was not persuaded to change its finding that Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services. Dr Mathews characterises his submissions as 'careful, detailed and reasoned' and the amendments which the Committee made in its Final Report as 'grudging and minor', but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language, without more, is unhelpful. It was further submitted that, in essence, Dr Mathews' contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the Committee did not accept the changes to the Draft Report which he proposed. In my view, there is substance in that submission.

33 Dr Mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged pre-judgment. These were summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions as follows:
 
 ' (a) Appendix 1, service no. 4 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 30 October 2003 the applicant told the Committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist, ordered an IGE test, thinks he performed a spirometry test and that "the management plan for her was Ventolin." 
 
 In the Draft Report the Committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patient's presenting problem. 
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I do not accept this reason. I referred the patient to an allergy specialist; ordered an IGE pathology test and performed a spirometry test. I had also been prescribing her Ventolin. In my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan.
 
 In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. 
 
 
 
 (b) Appendix 2, service no. 1 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. At the Committee's request, he read out his clinical note: "Vomiting, Promethazine, 4 u.e., urea, electrolytes and creatinine which is in those days I think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days I think."
 
 In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that "At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache."
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I did record a selective history of "vomiting". I knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine. There was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of Promethazine and I advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function, kidney function and the state of her hydration."
 
 In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. 
 
 
 
 (c) Appendix 2, service 3 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. He read out his clinical note: "FOC, Ceclor CD, Ventolin and Becloforte. In answer to a question about whether he performed a peak-flow reading, he said: "I did not perform a peak flow reading, it is not written down. I do not know whether I did. Sometimes yes I did but it is not written down there so I do not recall.
 
 In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that "At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest. No peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma."
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I did record a selective history with my shorthand notation 'FOC'. The patient's history of asthma and smoking was known to me. I did record my management plan which was to prescribe Ceclor for his chest infection; Ventolin and Becloforte for the patient's asthma. The evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the Committee cannot make such a finding (see T p 26 line 31 ff)."
 
 In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. 
 
 
 
 (d) Appendix 3, service 15 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that: "I gave him the Ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner, Christine, who was an invalid. So in a fashion he was a carer, and as I said, his legs he had been my patient for probably 15 years."
 
 The applicant also told the Committee that: "The presenting complaint with Ron was that he was had massive anxiety because he was worried about Christine and his knees there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before, that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine, because when Christine fell over he would have to pick her up, and as I said he has I have asked him to have his knees x-rayed many, many times. He has never had it x-rayed. He is non-compliant.
 
 In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia: "No evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input, limited examination and management. In Dr Mathew's oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for Ducene for the pain to damaged knees."
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report that: "I do not agree with this view of the consultation. At T p 49 line 32, I said that I gave Ducene in an attempt to reduce the patient's alcohol consumption, not for pain. My oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patient's household. The patient's knees have been a matter of ongoing concern for some time."
 
 In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in its Draft Report.' (Footnotes omitted)

38 Pursuant to subs 106K(3), the Minister made Health Insurance (Professional Services Review Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ('the Sampling Determination'), which provides, inter alia :
 
 ' Part 1 Preliminary 
 
 1 ... 
 
 2 ... 
 
 3 Purpose 
 
 
 
 This Determination specifies the content and form of a sampling methodology that may be used by a Committee in making findings for an adjudicative referral. 
 
 
 
 4 Application 
 
 
 
 
 (1) This Determination applies if the Committee decides, in respect of conduct in connection with rendering or initiating the services included in a particular class of the referred services, to have regard only to a sample of the services included in the class. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The sampling methodology in Part 2 applies to: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of services; and 
 (b) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of patients. 
 
 
 5 Definitions 
 
 
 
 In this Determination: 
 
 
 
 
 
 Act means the Health Insurance Act 1973 . 
 
 class size , in relation to a sample, means the number of services rendered or initiated in the particular class of referred services from which a sample is chosen. 
 
 exploratory sample has the meaning given in section 8. 
 
 final random sample has the meaning given in section 10. 
 
 preliminary random sample has the meaning given in section 6. 
 
 Note 1 The following terms that are used in this Determination are defined in subsection 3 (1) of the Act: 
 
 
 &#8226; Initiate 
 &#8226; Patient. 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 Part 2 Sampling methodology 
 
 6 Preliminary random sample 
 
 
 
 In having regard, under subsection 106K (1) of the Act, only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services, a Committee must ensure that the sample (the preliminary random sample ) is a random sample. 
 
 
 
 7 Appropriate sample size 
 
 
 
 
 (1) The preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95% confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within +/- 10% of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled, at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50% of services rendered or initiated (the incidence requiring the largest sample). 
 
 (2) For a class of services specified in a referral, the appropriate sample size of the preliminary random sample is at least: 
 
 
 
 
 N 
 __________ 
 1+0.01(N-1) 
 
 
 
 
 where: 
 
 N = class size. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) If the appropriate sample size worked out is not a whole number, it must be rounded up to the next whole number. 
 
 
 
 
 8 Exploratory sample 
 
 
 
 In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services) (the exploratory sample ) , randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample; and 
 (b) determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice. 
 
 
 
 
 9 Percentage of inappropriate practice in exploratory sample 
 
 
 
 
 (1) After the Committee has determined which of the services in an exploratory sample constitute inappropriate practice, it must work out the percentage of services in the sample that constitutes inappropriate practice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The percentage must be expressed as a whole number (being, if necessary, rounded down to the nearest whole number). 
 
 
 
 
 10 ...'

39 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue. Paragraph (d) contains the first allegation of error. Dr Mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, in particular the words 'must ensure', when used in relation to the words 'that the sample (the preliminary random sample) is a random sample', effectively requires the Committee to undertake the sampling itself. Alternatively, it is said that if s 6 does not require the Committee to do the sampling itself, it requires the Committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services, included in a particular class of selected services, is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the Committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class, derived from a larger list of services of that particular class, 'fed' to them by the Director, even if the Committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample.

40 The primary submission can be rejected out of hand. On no construction of s 6 of the Sampling Determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the Committee itself.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>67 The question which arises is whether this error invalidates the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report, namely, that the conduct of Dr Mathews in connection with rendering MBS Item 23, 24 and 193 services that were the subject of Adjudicative Referral 223 was, in the Committee's opinion, unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners and constituted inappropriate practice as defined in s 82 of the Act. In my view it does and for the following reasons:
 
 1. The importance of complying with the sampling methodology in the Sampling Determination is borne out by all the provisions of s 106K of the Act, but in particular the deeming operation of subs 106K(2) and the fact that the Committee is, by subs 106K(4), prohibited from using a sampling methodology that is not specified in a determination made under subs 106K(3), unless it is ordered by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia that the sampling methodology is statistically valid.
 2. The opening words of s 8 of the Sampling Determination make it clear that its requirements are mandatory: 'In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must ...'.
 3. In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, the majority rejected (at 389 391, [92] [93]) the traditional distinction between 'mandatory' and 'directory' requirements, saying that: '[a] better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid'. In determining the purpose of the legislation, regard has to be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'.
 4. Nevertheless, having regard to the mandatory terms of s 8 of the Sampling Determination and its importance in the process of statistical sampling upon which the Committee's finding is ultimately made, I am of the view that it is a purpose of the Sampling Determination that a finding made in reliance on an act done in breach of s 8 of the Sampling Determination is an invalid finding: See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 per McHugh J at [72] [73]; per Hayne J at [205].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/7.html</AustLII>
<text>23 With respect, I also have difficulty with this ground of review. Indeed, counsel for Dr Mathews accepted that there is no 'general law' requirement that administrative decision-makers must give reasons: Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656. In that case, it was acknowledged by Gibbs CJ (at 670) and by Deane J (at 676) that there may be 'special circumstances' where natural justice requires reasons to be given, however, only one instance was cited in which 'special circumstances' have been found in the intervening period. This suggests that 'special circumstances' are particularly rare.

24 On behalf of Dr Mathews, it was submitted that the legislative context in the present case gives rise to such 'special circumstances'; the statutory provision regarding the drawing and provision of a draft report and permitting further submissions on it from an applicant would be meaningless unless the reasoning were to be exposed both as a necessary matter of statutory construction and as a matter of procedural fairness to Dr Mathews. Whether or not this is so, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the Committee did give reasons in its Draft Report see ground 4 above and it is idle to suggest that an applicant who is able to produce submissions responding to virtually every sentence in the Draft Report was not informed about the reasoning process which the Committee had adopted. I agree with this submission.

25 Ground 5 is as follows:
 
 ' [The Committee's] Draft and Final Reports, considered together, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, in that a fair-minded lay-person, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings and the matters in issue, who is aware of the evidence and submissions in the proceedings, including the further evidence provided by [Dr Mathews] after the hearing, would consider that [the Committee] was biased against [Dr Mathews] , in the sense that their mind was closed to the issues raised by [Dr Mathews] and nothing [Dr Mathews] said after the preparation of the Draft Report could have changed the view that [the Committee] had taken about [Dr Mathews'] case.'

26 The Application contains the following particulars with respect to this ground of review:
 
 
 '(i) Nowhere in the appendices to the Final Report, in which the purported reasons for the material findings were outlined, is there any express acknowledgment of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) But for formal acknowledgement that the submissions and evidence were received, and several minor modifications, no change to the findings or reasons for findings is made as a result of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) [Dr Mathews'] oral evidence, accepted with little comment at the hearing, is barely referred to in either the body of the report or the appendices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) [The Committee] failed to undertake its own random sampling in accordance with s 106K of the Act, relying instead on a pool of samples drawn by [HIC] and already examined in detail by the [Director] (in his investigation prior to the Adjudicative Referral) and already found by him (or his officers, servants and agents) to have been sufficiently deficient and/or adverse to [Dr Mathews] to cause him to refer the matter to [the Committee] . The pool was accordingly, no longer a random sample by any definition of that expression.'

27 Dr Mathews submits that the Final Report contains only the most grudging and minor amendments (styled by the Committee as 'clarification' see [98] of the Committee's Final Report), makes no acknowledgement of Dr Mathews' further evidence, and, in the main, ignores Dr Mathews' submissions entirely and is, for those reasons, affected by apprehended bias.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/97.html</AustLII>
<text>78 I agree with the submissions of counsel for the respondents that the Committee treated the deficiencies which it found in Dr Mathews' records as one only of the relevant factors which it took into account when making findings of inappropriate practice in respect of each of the three MBS item services. It did indeed treat adequate record keeping as a component of the clinical input necessary for proper treatment of the patient and that approach is consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97 at [82] where Tamberlin J said:
 
 'It is evident from the language of the Final Report that the Committee did not treat the failure to keep records, for example, in itself sufficient justification to arrive at its findings. Rather, the Committee took this into account as a relevant factor and in my opinion, it was entitled to adopt this approach and to enquire into this matter.' 
 
 

I agree with his Honour's approach.

79 For the foregoing reasons, this ground of appeal cannot be sustained.

80 It follows from the foregoing that the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report is invalid because it is predicated upon the Committee's failure to observe the sampling methodology of the Sampling Determination, in particular, the provisions of s 8. In the circumstances, the appropriate declaration and orders are that:
 
 1. The Committee's Final Report be declared invalid.
 2. Adjudicative Referral No. 223 be set aside.
 3. The matter be remitted to the Director with a direction that he establish a differently constituted committee to determine the reference to Adjudicative Referral No. 223 according to law.
 4. The first, second and third respondents pay the applicant's costs.

To fully appreciate what their Honours there said, one needs to refer also to the surrounding context of [27] [31] inclusive:
 
 ' [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of "a fair-minded lay observer" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private. 
 
 [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof. 
 
 [29] Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented. 
 
 [30] Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented -- often vigorously. Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question. Similar questions by a judge in curial proceedings in which the parties are legally represented may more readily give rise to an apprehension of bias than in the case of inquisitorial proceedings. 
 
 [31] Where, however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person whose evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated. If that should happen, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision-maker's view.

29 There is no submission on behalf of Dr Mathews in relation to this ground of apprehended bias that he was overborne or intimidated by vigorous testing of his evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses at the hearing before the Committee such as to lead a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person to infer that there is no evidence he could give which could change the Committee's view. The only basis of this ground is put in terms of [27] supra.

30 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Dr Mathews' contention that the Committee ought to have had regard to unspecified 'further evidence' allegedly incorporated in his submissions on the Draft Report should be rejected. It was submitted that while Dr Mathews was entitled to make '... written submissions suggesting changes to the Draft Report ...', he was not entitled to give evidence see subs 106KD(3) of the Act.</text>

<text>20 The majority in Yung (Burchett and Hill JJ) did not comment on the Committee's obligations under s 106L, but in Lee v Maskell-Knight [2004] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 207 ALR 362 at [43] , Hill and Marshall JJ quoted Beaumont J's remarks with apparent approval. Heerey J also commented on s 106L in Mercado v Holmes [2000] FCA 620 , overturned on appeal at [2000] FCA 1848 ; (2000) 111 FCR 160, but without any disapproval of this comment: 
 
 '... the task of the Committee is not to make a finding as to the occurrence or otherwise of a specific event but, pursuant to s 106L, to express an opinion in generalised and conclusionary terms by reference to a subjective and value-laden criterion, namely what members think the general body of general practitioners would think about the conduct in question: s 82(1)(a).'</text>
