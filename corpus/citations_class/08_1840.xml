<text>1 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, given on 22 August 2008 and published as SZMHQ v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1190. The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), dated 17 April 2008, and handed down or sent on 13 May 2008. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), the first respondent to this appeal, not to grant the appellant a protection visa.

2 The appellant is a citizen of Thailand, who arrived in Australia on 2 September 2007. On 12 October 2007, she applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a protection visa. The decision of the delegate of the Minister refusing to grant the visa was made on 20 December 2007.

3 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean, respectively, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to refer to these two documents, taken together, as the "Convention".</text>
