<tocase>Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1220</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1220.html</AustLII>
<text>I recently published my reasons in this matter and directed that the parties bring in draft Minutes of Orders: Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1220. While I gave them the opportunity to put on submissions on costs, I indicated my then present inclination was to make no order as to costs. That view reflected my appreciation of the balance of wins and losses on disputed issues and claims made in the proceedings viewed as a whole.

I need not reiterate the nature of the claims and cross-claims in any detail other than to say that, a discrete cross-claim for breach of confidence apart, collectively the various claims fell broadly into two classes. One large class related to claims for alleged breaches, and for wrongful repudiation, of a distribution agreement. These claims were surrounded by the predictable, satellite Trade Practices Act claims. The other class of claims related to intellectual property. The principal claims here related to trade marks owned by AMC and to breach of AMC's copyright although the latter both was surrounded by satellite claims such as passing off and was collaterally attacked initially in a Trade Practices Act claim (later abandoned by Hamilton).

My findings on AMC's claims resulted in my dismissal of all of its intellectual property related claims. On the contract claims I found Hamilton to be in breach of the Distribution Agreement in several respects but only nominal damages were awarded.</text>

<text>This narrative rather illustrates that while there were in substance two major areas of dispute between the parties, the parties' real successes were essentially defensive ones. It is appropriate to say, in my view, that as a matter of substance and reality, Hamilton won the claim. It is equally appropriate to say that the discrete breach of confidence claim apart, AMC won the cross-claim: cf Timms v Clift [1997] QCA 61 ; [1998] 2 Qd R 100 at 107. This outcome needless to say helped inform the inclination I foreshadowed as to an appropriate costs order.</text>

<tocase>Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333</tocase>
<text>The parties have now put on extensive submissions in relation to costs. It emerges that Hamilton on 29 February 2008 made an offer of compromise of the entire action which it says was in accordance with the principle stated in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333. That offer was rejected by AMC on 7 March and a counter-offer made. On 18 March 2008 Hamilton made an offer of compromise of AMC's claim in compliance with O 23 of the Federal Court Rules . It was not accepted. A subsequent O 23 offer was made on 17 June 2008. It likewise was not accepted. I am now asked to consider the appropriate incidence of costs in light of the offers to which I have referred. It is necessary to consider them seriatim.

Before so doing I should refer briefly to the breach of confidence cross-claim. Hamilton was entirely successful in its claim against AMC in establishing liability. An account of profits has been ordered. I dismissed a like claim made against Dr Keung. Hamilton's claim was a small, self contained and, in my view, routine breach of confidence matter. As will be seen from my reasons the liability question could be dealt with shortly. I am satisfied that, in relation to it, it should be ordered that AMC should pay Hamilton's costs of the claim on a party and party basis and that Hamilton should pay Dr Keung's costs in relation to its unsuccessful claim against him. 1. The Calderbank, "Entire Action Offer" of 29 February 2008

This offer was made by Hamilton to resolve "all issues in dispute" with AMC. The offer made was that, in consideration for the termination of the Distribution Agreement and in return for AMC (a) discontinuing its claim in the action and (b) providing an all-encompassing deed of release ("on terms to be agreed") in respect of any past or future claim whatsoever against Hamilton, Hamilton would take all steps necessary (and available to it) to affirm ownership of the Fuyunhon and Tuotoning marks by your client;
 release your client from its obligations pursuant to the restrictive covenant imposed upon your client by Clause 41.1.7 of the Distribution Agreement (thereby allowing your client to lawfully sell its competing "Fuyunhon" products in Hong Kong); 
 discontinue its cross-claim in the Action (including the proposed amendments to our client's cross-claim as advised in our 11 February 2008 letter); 
 forgive and write off the sum of $35,091.12 owed by your client to our client and subject of invoice no EXP 1768; 
 provide your client with any reasonable assistance that it requires to prosecute its litigation against Forward Company currently on foot in Hong Kong;
 grant your client a limited licence to sell its inventory of Hamilton products in Hong Kong;
 provide your client with an all-encompassing release (on terms to be agreed in a Deed) in respect of any present or future claim against your client;
 pay your client the sum of $250,000 AUD (inclusive of any GST payable) which amount is inclusive of any claim for costs and interest by your client; and

As is well accepted, the non-acceptance of a Calderbank offer can be a relevant matter for consideration on the question whether the discretion to order costs should be exercised on an indemnity basis rather than in accordance with the Court's usual practice of ordering party and party costs, if its non-acceptance is followed by a result to the offeree which is less favourable than the offer made: see MGICA (1992) Pty Ltd v Kenny &amp; Good Pty Ltd (1996) 70 FCR 236 ; on the primacy of the ordinary practice see Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 ; and see generally on Calderbank offers, Dal Pont, Law of Costs , [13.46]-[13.69] (2 nd ed, 2009).

The significance for costs purposes to be attributed to a rejected Calderbank offer falls, increasingly, for determination by reference to criteria of reasonableness: Was the offer a reasonable one in the circumstances? Was its rejection unreasonable when viewed in light of the circumstances existing at the time of its rejection? See eg University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 at 361; Dal Pont at [13.58]. In making that determination, the circumstances of the litigation and the parties' understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective cases can be relevant considerations: see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] .

In its Calderbank letter Hamilton indicated that, if AMC did not accept its offer, Hamilton would deliver a formal offer of compromise in accordance with the Federal Court Rules . It went on to indicate that the offer would be for a monetary sum only.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1996/1029.html</AustLII>
<text>As Mansfield J indicated in Smith v 600 Machinery Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 1029 , O 23 of the Federal Court Rules provides a structure which encourages the parties throughout a proceeding to offer and to consider a fair and reasonable compromise of their proceeding while also providing a party with the means of protecting its position in relation to costs against an opponent with unrealistic expectations of the proceeding's likely outcome. The Rules prescribes both the formalities for an offer to be characterised as one made for O 23 purposes and the costs consequences of unaccepted offers.

Relevantly for present purposes O 23 r 11(5) provides: 
 
 (5) If: 
 

 
 
 (a) an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant; and 
 

 
 
 (b) the applicant obtains judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable than the terms of the offer; 
 

 
 
 then, unless the Court otherwise orders: 
 

 
 
 (c) the applicant is entitled to an order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs in respect of the claim incurred up to 11 am on the day after the day when the offer was made, taxed on a party and party basis; and 
 

 
 
 (d) the respondent is entitled to an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs in respect of the claim incurred after that time, taxed on an indemnity basis.</text>

<text>So is created a rebuttable presumption of indemnity costs, it then being incumbent on the applicant to show reason why the Court should "otherwise order". As Hely J indicated in Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at [17]: 
 
 ... the prima facie position should only be departed from for proper reasons which, in general, only arise in an exceptional case. 
 

 
See also Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 40. While emphasising that it is impossible to state exhaustively the circumstances in which a discretion to the contrary might be exercised, it is established that the fact that an applicant acted reasonably in rejecting an offer of compromise is not itself a sufficient reason to displace the operation of the rule: Futuretronics at [11]. As Dal Pont has indicated (at [13.17]):
 
 
 ... a party who rejects an offer cannot reasonably compain if, due to [the] risks and vicissitudes [of litigation], his or her judgment proves unsound.</text>

<tocase>Sunlec International Ltd v Carroll Australasia Pty Ltd [2001] WASC 354</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2001/354.html</AustLII>
<text>I would note in passing AMC made a further counter-offer on 30 June 2000 in which (inter alia) it reduced the monetary sum it required to be paid to $1,250,000. See also Sunlec International Ltd v Carroll Australasia Pty Ltd [2001] WASC 354 at [14] .

At no stage in this matter prior to the publication of my reasons in the principal proceedings had AMC sought declaratory relief in relation to its proprietorship and beneficial ownership of the Fuyunhon and Tuotoning marks or to its ownership of the copyright in the Hong Kong packaging and the English language product indications for Urederm. While fact findings to the above effect in relation to the trade marks are implicit in my reasons and are explicit in relation to copyright ownership, I am not prepared now to make declarations to the above effect as AMC now seeks: on the potential significance of injunctions and declarations for the purposes of the O 23 r 11(5) comparison see Sunlec International at [16]. I will later return to this.

The second matter to be noted arises from the fact that the O 23 offer related only to AMC's claim and not to Hamilton's cross-claim. This split could well be perceived as a tactical manoeuvre given that the cross-claim asserted Hamilton's entitlement to AMC's trade marks. A decision by AMC so to agree to split the respective proceedings, in my view, was not to be expected. It was, in the context of the litigation, quite improbable.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/76.html</AustLII>
<text>There are two additional matters that need to be noted. First, the comparison which O 23 r 11(5) requires is between the "judgment on the claim to which the offer relates" and "the terms of the offer". If the "judgment" is less favourable than the offer, the presumption arises. As was observed by the Full Court in Digga Australia Pty Ltd v Norm Engineering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 76 at [20] : 
 
 The reference in the rule to "judgment" directs attention to "a judgment, decree or order ...": see s 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth); s 13 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth); s 4 ("judgment") of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). We do not think that the comparison between the judgment obtained and the terms of the offer to which O 23 r 11(5) refers embraces a reference to findings made in the reasons for judgment.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1946/19.html</AustLII>
<text>The principle to be applied to the taxation of costs in such cases was stated by Dixon J in Smith v Madden [1946] HCA 19 ; (1946) 73 CLR 129 at 133: 
 
 In such a case the taxation of the costs of the action and of the counterclaim is governed by the principle that the party receiving the costs of the claim should recover the general costs and whatever was reasonably incurred in bringing and maintaining or defending the action, as the case may be, considered as if there had been no counterclaim, and that the party receiving the costs of the counterclaim should recover the further or increased costs reasonably incurred in bringing and maintaining or defending the counterclaim. 
 

 
Nonetheless, his Honour acknowledged that where the successful (or unsuccessful) party on the claim or the counterclaim was not successful (or unsuccessful) on all issues, it may be appropriate to reflect this in any cost orders made by, for example, costs according to success or failure on costs issues in the claim or counterclaim (but not as between them: at 134-136) or by making a percentage or apportionment order in relation to the costs of the claim or counterclaim: at 133; and see Dal Pont [8.4].

Though they could be said, if only for reasons of their timing, to raise slightly different issues, I intend to treat the two O 23 offers together the more so as the change in the offer amount made is not material in the view I take of the matter.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1997/926.html</AustLII>
<text>The relief sought by AMC in its Further Amended Statement Claim sought declarations and orders in relation to the terms and effect of particular contractual provisions, rectification and damages for breach of contract, damages and injunctive relief at law and/or under the TP Act for, variously, misleading or deceptive conduct, passing off, copyright infringement and conversion as well as other ancillary relief. In light of my conclusions, it cannot be doubted that the judgment on AMC's claim will be less favourable to it than either of the offers made. In relation to the contractual claims for damages for breach of contract arising out of the parallel importation claim and for wrongful repudiation, AMC was claiming substantial damages. In relation to the parallel importation claim, only nominal damages were awarded. Given the apparent object of the claim made was to secure substantial damages and was not to establish a legal right irrespective of the monetary relief awarded, I do not consider that AMC could properly be regarded as having been successful on this issue for costs purposes. As was said in the Full Court in Nexus Minerals NL v Brutus Constructions Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 926 at 11-12: 
 
 An award of nominal damages ought not today be regarded as a "peg on which to hang costs": cf Beaumont v Greathead [1846] EngR 257 ; (1846) 2 CB 494 at 499; see McGregor on Damages , para404-para405, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, (1988, 15 th ed); see also Burrows, Remedies for Tort and Breach of Contract , 269-270, Butterworths, London (2 nd ed 1994).
