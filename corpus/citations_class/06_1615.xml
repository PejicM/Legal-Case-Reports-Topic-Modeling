<text>19 In an appropriate case it may well be permissible to tender evidence on review. However, whether it is an appropriate case will depend upon the grounds of review and the circumstances of the case. I refer to the judgment of Weinberg J in Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 where at 564, [454] he stated:
 
 I accept that, ordinarily, material not before the decision-maker at the time of the making of the decision will not be admissible in proceedings for judicial review.</text>

<tocase>MZWPK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1256</tocase>

<text>16 It is clear from the Tribunal's reasons for its decision that it found there was insufficient information to enable it to reach a level of satisfaction as to Australia's obligations to the appellant. The word 'information' in s 424A(1) imports at least some positive factual material and does not apply where the Tribunal has identified a lack of information: see SZBCS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1457 per Bennett J at [23]; MZWPK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1256 per Heerey J at [14]; and Tran v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1522 per Kenny J at [25]-[26]. Therefore, it is clear that s 424A(1) was not enlivened at the time it invited the appellant to the hearing and the Tribunal was not required to give the appellant notice pursuant to that section.</text>

<tocase>SZCJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609</tocase>

<text>14 His Honour dismissed that claim and stated at [22]-[23] that he considered that no obligation arose under that section given that at the time that the Tribunal notified the appellant that it was unable to determine the review in his favour on the material before it, the Tribunal had not reached any view on whether the adequacy of the material submitted to the delegate would be part of the reason for its decision. In support of his reasoning, his Honour indicated that he was bound to follow the decision of Heerey J in SZCJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [38] - [43] .

15 The reason for his Honour's focus upon whether the obligation under s 424A arose at the time that the Tribunal notified the appellant that it was unable to determine the review in his favour on the material before it was that this was how the appellant particularised the breach in his grounds in the amended application. His Honour did not go on to consider whether there was a breach of s 424A at any other time.</text>
