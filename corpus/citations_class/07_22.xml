<tocase>Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglon (1990) 12 AAR 515</tocase>
<text>12 In Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglon (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 519 Ryan J indicated that because O 53 was not qualified in any way by reference to the other Rules, it should in the first instance determine the practice and procedure applicable to appeals from the AAT. The parties made no submission to the contrary.

13 Indeed, the second respondent stressed that the Court should apply O 53 in its terms, rather than direct that the venue of the hearing of the appeal be changed to the Victoria District Registry under s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), or under O 30 r 6(1), or that the proceeding be transferred to that Registry under O 10 r 1(2)(f), having regard to the definition of the "proper place" in O 1 r 4 of the Rules.</text>

<tocase>Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 70 FCR 403</tocase>
<text>14 In Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 70 FCR 403, Hill J at 407 pointed out that, for the purposes of enlivening the Court's power to control access to certain documentation under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the "hearing of a proceeding" could extend to a directions hearing or an interlocutory process. See also E v Australian Red Cross Society (1991) 27 FCR 310. That view is reflected in, and consistent with, the definition of "hearing" in O1 r 4 of the Rules, namely that "hearing includes any hearing before the Court, whether final or interlocutory, and whether in open court or in chambers". Order 10, referring to the Court's powers at a directions hearing, apparently uses the term "hearing" in r 1(2)(c) in a somewhat more confined sense as a hearing in which the Court proposes to perform an adjudicative function (not necessarily a final adjudication). Order 30 r 1(2)(a) uses the term "trial" to include any interlocutory hearing. In Martin v Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd [1981] 2 NSWLR 430, Hunt J at 434-436 regarded an appeal "after a trial or a hearing on the merits" as including to an appeal from an interlocutory hearing. A similar conclusion was reached by Anderson J in Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works v Bevelon Investments Pty Ltd [1977] VR 473 at 475-477.</text>

<tocase>South Australia v Victoria [1911] HCA 17 ; (1911) 12 CLR 667</tocase>

<text>19 However, O 53 r 1 directs attention not to the District Registry of the AAT in which it heard the matter but to the geographical place, namely the State or Territory, in which the AAT heard the matter. The hearing must be the hearing of the issue in the matter which led to the decision the subject of the appeal. In the present appeal, that issue was the definition of, and extent of, the King Valley wine region. The President sat only in Victoria apart from giving his decision, which he gave in Sydney (so the hearing of the matter may be said to have taken place both in Victoria and New South Wales). The application does not complain of the orders made, or declined, at directions hearings. However, I do not consider it is possible to divorce the location of the directions hearings from "the matter" referred to in O 53 r 1. The hearing to which O 53 r 1 refers is that of the matter itself, and not a particular issue or issues, or a particular step or steps in the process. The term "matter" of course conveys the whole of the controversy before the AAT: South Australia v Victoria [1911] HCA 17 ; (1911) 12 CLR 667 at 675; Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 7 ; (1981) 148 CLR 457 at 507-509.</text>

<tocase>National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>24 The parties did not seek to rely on the jurisprudence concerning the transfer of proceedings or the determination of the "proper place" of proceedings under s 48 of the FCA Act, or O 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Rules. However, their submissions focussed upon the connection of the subject of the AAT proceedings and this appeal to Victoria and the respective convenience of the parties. Their submissions therefore in fact centred upon the sort of considerations discussed in National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155 and subsequent decisions concerning s 48 of the FCA Act and O 10 r 1(2)(f).

25 In this matter, there is no circumstance relevant to the efficient administration of the Court to be weighed. The appeal will be heard following the next Full Court callover with equal facility in Adelaide or Melbourne.

26 Clearly, the subject matter of the appeal is in Victoria. Nothing more need to be said on that point. The application to the AAT in its South Australia District Registry appears to have been made because the applicants were South Australian based, and had relevant interests in or in the vicinity of the King Valley area.

29 In my view, generally speaking, little weight should be given to the fact that counsel or the solicitors for a party are in a particular location. Principally, that is because the selection of counsel and solicitors is a matter for the parties. Their choice should not be of significance to the identification of the proper place of a matter. The Court is a national Court, with Registries in each State and Territory and can sit anywhere in Australia. However, to an extent, there is a tendency for parties to institute proceedings in a Registry of the Court convenient to counsel or the solicitors for the parties rather than in a Registry which has a real connection with the subject matter of the dispute, or indeed with the parties themselves or the witnesses. I do not think that the Registry where proceedings are instituted should be dictated by that consideration. Further, where that is the case, it may well be appropriate to transfer the proceeding to a proper place, having regard to the considerations discussed in Sentry and other cases.

30 For those reasons, I order that the Victoria District Registry is the appropriate Registry for this appeal and that the proceeding be transferred to the Victoria District Registry of the Court.

31 In my view, as the second respondent has succeeded on its motion, but only on one of the two matters it argued, the appropriate order is that the costs of the second respondent on the motion should be its costs on the appeal. The intention of that order is that, if the appeal is successful, there will in effect be no costs of the motion, but if the appeal is dismissed and the second respondent gets its costs of the appeal, those costs will include its costs of and incidental to the motion.

 I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.
