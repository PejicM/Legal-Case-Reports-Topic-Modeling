<tocase>Campomar Sociedad Ltd v Nike International Ltd (2000) 46 IPR 481</tocase>
<text>51 As earlier foreshadowed, UBI has pleaded further causes of action upon the footing of conduct on the part of TV Plus in trade and commerce in Australia in contravention of ss 52 and 53(a), (b) and (d) of the TP Act, said to be constituted by the making of false, misleading and untrue representations to members of the public, and/or persons interested in receiving ethnic television broadcasts, to the effect that:
 
 (i) TV Plus held the right to broadcast the BHT-1 channel in Australia; and
 (ii) The rebroadcasting of the BHT-1 channel by TV Plus and the efforts of TV Plus to obtain subscribers based on their purported right and capacity to broadcast the BHT-1 channel was duly authorised by JRTS. 

For the purposes of establishing moreover liability for misleading and deceptive conduct under s 52 of the TP Act, TV Plus emphasised that there must be a relevant misrepresentation in order to be actionable, the Court being referred by TV Plus in that regard to Campomar Sociedad Ltd v Nike International Ltd (2000) 46 IPR 481 at 508-509; however there had been no representation by TV Plus concerning UBI's own broadcasts, that is, those broadcasts in relation to which UBI might own the copyright, so the TV Plus submission continued, because TV Plus had made those broadcasts from Australia. Nothing in the advertising or promotional activity otherwise of TV Plus was said by it to have suggested any association with UBI , and therefore no issue with respect to ss 52 or 53 of the TP Act arose adversely to TV Plus , so TV Plus further asserted. Essentially or largely, the same circumstances pleaded by UBI for breach of copyright were relied upon to support those pleaded causes of action. Damages and injunctive relief were similarly or correspondingly sought by UBI , in line with the relief sought for breach of copyright.

52 As to the issue of contractual entitlement, TV Plus submitted that there could be no misrepresentation relevantly to be imputed to TV Plus , in view of the fact (being a fact in issue from UBI's perspective) that there was a subsisting agreement between TV Plus and JRTS reached earlier on 4 January 2005 and which, among other things, constituted TV Plus Operations in particular as an exclusive licensee of the BHT-1 Channel along with 'its programming contents together with all associated rights ...'. While the purported grant of broadcast rights in the nature of copyright to TV Plus may have been nugatory because broadcasts from Bosnia and Herzegovina are not protected in Australia under the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations 1969 , so that TV Plus submission continued, so much was said to indicate that there was in any event a pre-existing contractual relationship between JRTS and TV Plus . Moreover TV Plus asserted that although it was said by UBI to have been acknowledged by TV Plus that there had been an earlier rejection by JRTS of any subsisting contractual obligation on its part in favour of TV Plus , nevertheless that any such rejection had occurred otherwise than within the terms of the TV Plus/JRTS contractual arrangements, and had not been in fact accepted by TV Plus . In that context it was further said by TV Plus to be beside the point for UBI to assert that TV Plus had never made payments under those arrangements, since TV Plus had always acknowledged its contractual liability to make such payments, though it maintained that the time for making even the initial payment falling due to JRTS has not yet crystallised for payment in favour of JRTS . In that regard, TV Plus asserted that no payment was due and payable under that TV Plus/JRTS agreement during the first six months of its term, yet the purported termination by Mr Hadzijamakovic on behalf of JRTS took place before the end of that six months period.

53 The foregoing circumstances propounded by TV Plus were therefore said by TV Plus to provide a firm basis for its asserted continuing belief that TV Plus was entitled to take the broadcast signals from JRTS originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to distribute the same in Australia, and that accordingly the representation said to arise from the conduct of TV Plus was not misleading. Hence TV Plus submitted therefore that there was no prima facie case or serious question arising at least as to the first misrepresentation pleaded by UBI against TV Plus. Once again there needs to be pointed out the difficulties as to giving expression to the TV Plus case in circumstances where it has (at least thus far) withheld from joining JRTS as a third party to the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Select Personnel Pty Ltd v Morgan and Banks Pty Ltd (1988) 12 IPR 167</tocase>
<text>56 The occasioning of ongoing loss to TV Plus , if TV Plus was to be relevantly enjoined in this interlocutory proceeding at the instance of UBI , was asserted by TV Plus to be 'considerable and would potentially threaten its whole undertaking', for the following reasons set out in Mr Jeremic's affidavit evidence ( TV Plus used the anglicised description therein of PBS rather than JRTS in those submissions, but for consistency in these reasons I have at least for the most part maintained reference to JRTS ):
 
 (i) its primary subscription base involves the Balkan States and approximately 90% of its revenue is derived by reference thereto;
 (ii) the BHT-1 broadcasts are a significant part of the so-called 'Balkans package' offered by TV Plus and there are close linguistic similarities between broadcasts from each of Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia, being a factor which has the consequence that the BHT-1 broadcasts are not just taken up by members of the Bosnian community in Australia;
 (iii) restraining TV Plus from broadcasting BHT-1 would place the TV Plus in breach of its contractual obligations to its subscribers, since it would no longer be able to offer BHT-1 as part of its Balkans package; Mr Jeremic estimated that there would be cancellations of approximately 1,500 subscribers (out of its approximate 3000 subscriber base) with a consequential loss of revenue to TV Plus of $100,000 per month;
 (iv) Mr Jeremic also estimated a further loss of 350 subscribers likely to be sustained by its so-called website streaming platform amounting to $22,750 per month, so much involving more than a 50% reduction in the TV Plus' income flow;
 (v) enjoining TV Plus to the extent proposed would lead to staff reductions and cancellations of service contracts, both in Australia and abroad, and would alone jeopardise the survival of TV Plus ;
 (vi) there have also been threats to the TV Plus service providers, such as to Globecast Australia ( ante ); though I should observe that the nature and extent of those threats were not indicated, nor evidence adduced from an officer of Globecast in that regard, despite the extent otherwise of evidence tendered by TV Plus already;
 (vii) the evidence was said to suggest that UBI does not have the financial resources to meet any undertakings as to damages necessary in order for UBI to obtain interlocutory relief, TV Plus referring thereby to UBI's paid up share capital apparently comprising merely one share of $1 par value, and to its membership being confined to one person (Ms Regina Boulos), yet UBI's assets were subject to a registered charge to secure up to $60 million over all of its undertaking and assets; moreover no balance sheets or profit and loss accounts of UBI had been produced or made available to TV Plus ; accordingly no injunction should be granted in any event until an undertaking could be given by a natural person individually, such as the sole director and member presently of UBI earlier recorded Ms Boulos; I was referred in that context to Select Personnel Pty Ltd v Morgan and Banks Pty Ltd (1988) 12 IPR 167, cited with approval by the Full Court of this Court in First Netcom Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2000] FCA 1269 ; (2000) 101 FCR 77 at [23] - [24] , and also to Permanent Promotions Pty Ltd v Independent Distillers (Aust) Pty Ltd (2004) 62 IPR 538 at [25-26];
 (viii) the notice to produce which had been issued by TV Plus to UBI was said to have been in the following terms: 
 
 
 (a) the minutes of board meetings of the applicant for 2005 and 2006;
 (b) the most current balance sheet and profit and loss statement of the applicant; and
 (c) all subscription agreements entered into by customers of the applicant for its Balkan Bouquet package between July 2006 and 6 December 2006,

<tocase>Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 218 CLR 273</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/14.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The yet further matter advanced by TV Plus in the context of the copyright issues, in sequence of presentation, was that broadcast copyright is 'distinct' from copyright in other works in relation to what may constitute the taking of ' a substantial part ' of the copyright work within s 14(1) of the Copyright Act . I was referred in that regard to the decision of the High Court in Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 218 CLR 273, and in particular at 299-303. The particular copyright work there established by the High Court consisted essentially of identified televised programmes or certain segments of televised programmes, as established by a majority of the High Court, rather than merely single images. In the course of the reasons for judgment of the majority of the High Court, it was explained that television broadcast copyright concerns broadcasts ' made from a place in Australia ', and so made ' under the authority of a license...or class license ' issued under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), and thereby involved the notion that the maker of the broadcaster is taken to be ' the person who provided the broadcasting services by which the broadcast was delivered '. The statutory scope of ' provide ' or ' provision ' may therefore be seen to be comprehensive. TV Plus did not appear to explain at the present stage of the proceedings why the notion of ' substantial part' was not susceptible to satisfaction in the particular circumstances of the present proceedings.

50 TV Plus next advanced the submission that in order to establish infringement here on the part of any one or more of the TV Plus companies, it would be necessary in any event for UBI to establish interception and thereafter broadcast (or what may conceivably be termed as 're-broadcast') within Australia, and it would not be enough in that regard for UBI's copyright cause of action to demonstrate interception from a place outside of Australia. Given the complexity of the modern technology involved in television transmission of televised programs originating offshore, and the apparent need for TV Plus to comprehensively establish the circumstances as to interception etc, it would be inappropriate to resolve any such complex as well as apparently controversial issues at this interlocutory stage. In that regard I refer to what I have earlier merely outlined in [4] above of these reasons. Mr Jeremic testified broadly and in a sense imprecisely as to the signals being transmitted 'in part from within Bosnia and Herzegovina', and the signals thus supposedly standing outside any notion of an Australian broadcast. TV Plus also pointed to the need for UBI to demonstrate copying in a television context, explaining that '[s]imilarities alone, or even complete identity, between the parties' works or their subject matter, are not enough in the absence of copying, as copyright is not a monopoly right such as a patent'. It is enough from a practical perspective to merely record and not resolve any such issues at the present stage of the proceedings, particularly given that more evidentiary precision, and further expert evidence, would appear to be required.</text>

<text>64 As foreshadowed, TV Plus has to date withheld from joinder of JRTS , yet TV Plus seeks to obtain from UBI a not insignificant extent of security for costs, being interlocutory relief which at least seems to me to be inappropriate to award, at least at the present time and until such circumstances can be addressed in an appropriately established context. JRTS has made known to TV Plus explicitly for some time its stance as to cessation of any contractual entitlement of TV Plus to broadcast in Australia television signals sourced from JRTS . It would be seemingly inappropriate to the exercise of the Court's discretion in its favour in the somewhat unique context presently prevailing, if not also inequitable, on the present state of the evidence, for TV Plus to gain the benefit of security for its costs provided by its Australian competitor UBI , in circumstances where it has withheld, at least for the time being, from joining to the proceedings the very entity from whom it claims controversially to derive its source of broadcasting entitlement or authority. In that regard, the present state of the evidence is that JRTS has maintained the position (and has done so in the context of its comprehensive affidavit material) of denial of any present entitlement, contractual or otherwise, of TV Plus to broadcast the television signals of JRTS in Australia, and for TV Plus to seek to do so to the competitive detriment of UBI as JRTS's asserted exclusive appointee in Australia. The commercial reality of the stance adopted by TV Plus may be described as being at least equally aggressive to that of UBI : Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd (1988) 19 FCR 324.

65 Assuming that an early final hearing is reasonably achievable, the making of final procedural orders should obviously be addressed by the parties and the precise formulation of those orders should be resolved as early as feasible. Of course the presently prevailing circumstances may change in the context of further steps that may be taken by any of the parties in order to resolve this complex as well as volatile dispute, being steps which may conceivably justify a re-opening of interlocutory issues. For the time being however, the status quo is that TV Plus is continuing controversially to utilise the television signals of JRTS in circumstances where UBI alone, and hence to the exclusion of TV Plus , is said by JRTS to be authorised. In the meantime in the context of the presently somewhat deficiently structured proceedings not yet fully and formally pleaded, and from which there has been thus far absent the critical off-shore source (ie JRTS ) of the subject television signals, I am of the view that I should defer the consideration of the grant of any interlocutory relief at least until there has been further clarification of the critical issues inherent to the dispute, including issues as to joinder of all necessary parties.

66 I direct that UBI provide to the Court draft orders to give effect to these reasons within three clear hearing days. I further direct that TV Plus respond with any changes required within a further two clear hearing days. The proceedings should then be listed for mention, hopefully with a view to fixing the date for a final expedited hearing to take place, and as early as possible having regard to all the circumstances for the time being prevailing, and in any event in order to resolve any remaining disputes in relation to the context of interim orders required to be put in place. An indication should be provided as to the nature and scope of what evidence (if any) remains to be adduced by each party, and of any additional issues of law still intended to be pursued. The costs of the present interlocutory proceedings would normally be ordered in terms merely as to costs of the proceedings generally, but I will entertain nevertheless any contrary submissions from either party so long as the same are furnished in writing within the next seven days. Of course there must be liberty to either side of the record to apply on seven days' notice to the other, that time taking into account the overseas elements of the proceedings.

 I certify that the preceding sixty-six (66) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.
