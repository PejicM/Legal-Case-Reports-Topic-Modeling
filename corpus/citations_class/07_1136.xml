<text>81 Assuming that it can be established that the representations as to future matters were made, it would appear the respondents bear the burden of establishing that there were reasonable grounds for the statements to have been made; Ting v Blanche (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276 at [47] Emmett J suggested that the effect of the section might be more limited:
 
 That is to say, it does not ultimately reverse the onus but simply provides that the deeming takes effect unless [emphasis added] the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary. ... If an applicant elects to adduce no evidence as to that question then the only evidence before the Court would be that adduced by the corporation. Whether that is adequate to establish that the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representation is a matter for the Court. However once the corporation has adduced some evidence, there is no deeming arising from s 51A(2).</text>

<tocase>Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1929/24.html</AustLII>
<text>73 The fiduciary obligations of partners may vary with the terms of the partnership agreement but will include at least the duty to act in partnership matters in the utmost good faith and loyalty in the interests of the partnership; see generally Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 407-409 per Dixon J. It is not necessary for me to expand on this issue further as it seems to me that the relief sought is more appropriately to be found under the regimes set up by the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act .

74 Mr Lewarne claims that, at the three meetings described above (the Mosman, Rosebery and Alexandria meetings) and in the two documents that allegedly outlined the basis of his agreement with Momentum and Mr Scotts, Mr Scotts made various representations that were misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive. Mr Lewarne makes his case against both Momentum Productions (under the Trade Practices Act ) and Mr Scotts himself (under the Fair Trading Act ), although of course to the extent that the representations were allegedly made by Momentum, Mr Lewarne's case is that Mr Scotts made the representations in his capacity as director of Momentum. Those representations are:
 
 1. Mr Scotts and/or Momentum was the owner of the building adjoining the Hotel;
 2. Mr Scotts and/or Momentum would, as one of the initial plans for the business after the assignment date, demolish part of the wall between the hotel and the adjoining building and extend the area of use under the liquor licence into the adjoining building;
 3. Mr Scotts and/or Momentum had obtained approval from the South Sydney Council to install and operate poker machines in the adjoining building;
 4. Mr Scotts and/or Momentum would, as one of the initial plans for the business after the assignment date, construct a new poker machine area and install and operate poker machines in the adjoining building;
 5. Mr Scotts and/or Momentum would continue to operate the ten existing poker machines at the hotel and would, as one of the initial plans for the business after the assignment date, procure and operate 5 additional poker machines at the hotel;
 6. Momentum would enter into a lease of the hotel premises for a term of 22 years;
 7. Mr Lewarne could expect to receive in excess of $75,000 per year in profit share;
 8. The sum of $300, 000 paid by Mr Lewarne would be applied toward the purchase of, or as working capital to, the business;
 9. The first representation continued to remain accurate and that there was no doubt or dispute concerning the ownership of the adjoining building or about the ability of the second respondent to secure legal and beneficial title.

75 Mr Lewarne claims that the ninth representation was a representation by silence in that Momentum and/or Mr Scotts failed to disclose that the first representation was inaccurate or that there were any issues concerning the ownership of the adjoining building.</text>

<text>78 Whether a representation was made, and if it was made, whether it constituted contravening conduct is to be assessed objectively looking at the conduct as a whole: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at 604. In a case such as this, where the relevant conduct was directed towards a particular person (namely, Mr Lewarne), the preferred approach is to analyse the conduct from this perspective, rather than from the perspective of a class of persons within which the complainant may fall. In Butcher at 604, the High Court held that this required an analysis of:
 
 'the character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers, bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them, or which each may be taken to have known.'</text>

<text>46 I have no doubt that, viewed objectively, the conduct of Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts suggests that they intended their arrangements to have legal consequences and that a contract was made at the latest when Mr Lewarne paid his $300,000 to Mr Scotts; Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002] HCA 8 ; (2002) 209 CLR 95 at 105-6. It is clear from Mr Dempsey's evidence that they intended to enter into an agreement that had been formally drawn by a solicitor. It may be that they envisaged that this could be done before they needed to commit to a binding arrangement and were prepared to consider the solicitor's advice as to how their relationship should be structured. It is equally clear in my view that this intention was overtaken by events. Mr Scotts' need for funds to meet the imminent settlement of the business purchase from Wellfox intervened.

<tocase>GR Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631</tocase>
<text>47 The discussions between Mr Lewarne and Mr Dempsey two days after the money had been paid over indicate that Mr Lewarne, at least, had not abandoned the idea of entering into a more formal contract. Given Mr Scotts earlier participation in discussions with Mr Dempsey I think it more likely than not that this was also his position. In my view Mr Scotts and Mr Lewarne intended to be bound immediately but also intended to make a further contract which would substitute for the original contract; GR Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631. That substitute contract was never made and therefore the proposed terms of it are not relevant to the resolution of the present issues.

48 In the negotiations leading up to the agreement, Mr Scotts spoke both for himself and Momentum. Indeed, as I have earlier commented, Mr Scotts referred to himself and Momentum interchangeably and without apparent distinction. On balance I find the evidence supports the conclusion that Momentum, as well as Mr Scotts, was a party to this preliminary contract. It is likely that Mr Anthony Scotts was also a member of the partnership from the same date however I have only limited evidence on this point which I have not been asked to decide. In general, I do not find it necessary to distinguish between Mr Scotts' conduct when he was acting for Momentum and when he was acting for himself and shall not do so unless there is a particular need.</text>

<tocase>Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/52.html</AustLII>
<text>128 Similarly, Mr Scotts' claim that by June 2004 the problems with the roof structure had affected the hotel trade to such an extent that they took priority over any expansion plans is also not to the point. As McHugh J noted in Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459 at 502, in the context of a discussion about damages under the Trade Practices Act : 
 
 ' ... the wrong which s 52 of the Act prohibits is the making of, not the failure to honour, the false representation.'

129 Mr Lewarne admitted that the plan to go next door was 'swamped' by the problems with the building, and in particular the scaffolding which was erected to repair the building. Accepting for present purposes that when Mr Scotts made the representations he could not have foreseen this drop in trade and its effect on the working capital of the business it does not bear on whether Mr Scotts had reasonable grounds for making the representations at the time they were made. The obstacles described above were such that I am satisfied that neither Mr Scotts nor Momentum had reasonable grounds for making representations two and four and that they were therefore misleading.

130 Even though the legal obstacles described above may have prevented the plans to extend the hotel next door for the purpose of operating poker machines, it is, however, not immediately clear whether they would have been obstacles to the pursuit of the plan described in representation five (which does not expressly refer to the adjoining premises). The fifth representation relates only to the operation of poker machines and in particular to the procurement of a further five gaming machines. Mr Lewarne claimed that there was simply no room for a further five poker machines in the hotel unless the adjoining wall was knocked down and the adjoining premises used to house the poker machines. This was particularly the case because the wall enclosing the existing poker machine room (the internal wall) needed to be removed as a precursor to extending into the adjoining premises, a move which required the removal of at least four of the existing 10 poker machines from the premises. Mr Lewarne, in cross-examination said that he agreed to store the five poker machines at the premises of one of his other businesses:
 
 'Mr Lewarne: Because we had already demolished the existing poker machine room and there was nowhere to put them and Richard informed me that the situation is that you have got to mask or prevent people at the bar or in the bar area looking in at the machines. Richard informed me of all the clocks on the walls and things like that. There was nowhere to put them so we put them at the AWN [sic] premises and then what we were going to do was once the hole was punched through the wall and the room finished, replace them. 
 
 Mr Sahade: You agreed with that decision? 
 
 Mr Lewarne: To place them at our factory? Well there was nowhere else. There really wasn't anywhere else to put them.'

131 Mr Lee submitted that, at the time that the representation was made it would have been clear that unless it was possible to extend the space available for poker machines into the adjoining premises it would not be able to operate the existing 10 poker machines, let alone procure and operate a further 5 poker machines.

132 Mr Scotts gave evidence that the five additional poker machines would initially be installed on the stairwell landing of the hotel premises and that once the gaming room had been created in the adjoining premises that the poker machines would be moved into it. Mr Lee, in cross-examining Mr Scotts, referred to the Magin report's reference to the cost of the additional poker machines being $20,000 - $30,000. Mr Lee suggested that, given Mr Scotts intended to lease the poker machines, this figure undermined his evidence that he intended to sit the extra poker machines on the stairwell, since there was no capital expenditure associated with sitting them on the stairwell. Accordingly, Mr Lee suggested that the Magin report anticipated that the additional poker machines would be installed and operated from the gaming room next door. While it is clear that the Magin report assumed that the new poker machines would be placed in the adjoining building it does nor follow from this assumption that the adjoining building was the only place that these poker machines could have been stored.

155 Accordingly, Mr Lewarne will be limited to damages for losses he incurred that, as a matter of common sense and experience, would not have been incurred but for Mr Scotts' misleading or deceptive representations. See also Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459 at 508 per Hayne J and 496 per McHugh J. In Wardley at 525, the High Court indicated that reliance upon a misleading representation is a sufficient causal link:
 
 Here we are concerned with contraventions of s 52(1) in the form of misleading conduct constituted by misrepresentations. In this situation, as at common law, acts done by the representee in reliance upon the misrepresentation constitute a sufficient connexion to satisfy the concept of causation. And, if those acts result in economic loss...that economic loss will ordinarily be recoverable under s 82(1)...

156 There is no doubt in my mind that Mr Lewarne was careless of his own interests in relying on Mr Scotts. Indeed, in cross-examination of Mr Lewarne it seems that, at least in part, the respondents were attempting to defend themselves on this basis. Carelessness of the representee, however, is not a basis for excluding relief under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act , nor is it necessary for the misleading conduct to be the sole cause of the loss, as the comments of Gleeson CJ in Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459 at 468-9 make clear:
 
 It will commonly be the case that a person who is induced by a misleading or deceptive representation to undertake a course of action will have acted carelessly, or will have been otherwise at fault, in responding to the inducement. The purpose of the legislation is not restricted to the protection of the careful or the astute. Negligence on the part of the victim of a contravention is not a bar to an action under s 82 unless the conduct of the victim is such as to destroy the causal connection between contravention and loss or damage. 
 ... 
 For there to be the necessary causal relationship between a contravention of s 52 , and loss or damage, so as to satisfy the requirements of s 82(1) , it is not essential that the contravention be the sole cause of the loss or damage.

157 See also the similar view expressed at 505 by McHugh J, with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed.

158 Mr Lewarne repeatedly said that each and every one of the representations was influential in his decision to invest money in the partnership. This claim of reliance was not seriously challenged and I am satisfied that, to a greater or less extent, the representations that were made were factors in Mr Lewarne's decision to invest his money in the East Village Hotel business. I have discussed the question of reliance in relation to the first and ninth representations above at [99]-[103] and [106] respectively.</text>

<tocase>Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110</tocase>
<text>49 The fact that Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts did not set out their agreement in writing and that it is not susceptible to a textbook analysis of offer and acceptance does not preclude there being a contract. In this regard the comments and cautions of McHugh JA (while a member of the New South Wales Court of Appeal) in Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117 are directly applicable to the present circumstances:
 
 It is often difficult to fit a commercial arrangement into the common lawyers' analysis of a contractual arrangement. Commercial discussions are often too unrefined to fit easily into the slots of "offer", "acceptance", "consideration" and "intention to create a legal relationship" which are the benchmarks of the contract of classical theory. In classical theory, the typical contract is a bilateral one and consists of an exchange of promises by means of an offer and its acceptance together with an intention to create a binding a legal relationship.... A bilateral contract of this type exists independently of and indeed precedes what the parties do. Consequently, it is an error "to suppose that merely because something has been done then there is therefore some contract in existence which has thereby been executed" ... Nevertheless, a contract may be inferred from the acts and conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words ... The question in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances shows a tacit understanding or agreement. The conduct of the parties, however, must be capable of proving all the element of an express contract. ... Care must also be taken not to infer anterior promises from conduct which represents no more than an adjustment of their relationship in the light of changing circumstances.</text>

The commercial arrangement is not, however, sufficient per se, to establish the point; for a dramatic example see Tesco Stores Ltd v Costain Constructions Ltd [2003] EWHC 1487. In Evans Deakin Pty Ltd v Sebel Furniture Ltd [2003] FCA 171 at [492] , Allsop J, having referred to the comments of Steyn LJ in First Energy (UK) Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep 194 at 196 to the effect that the law should strive to protect the 'reasonable expectations of honest men', cautioned against too heavy reliance on the commercial nature of the arrangements:
 
 However, none of these expressions of principle and guidance suggests or sanctions an approach whereby the ethical or moral merits of a commercial set of circumstances is assessed and a body of obligations thereafter is imposed, implied, or sculpted to protect the reasonable expectations of the innocent party merely because it is the victim of the unworthy behaviour of the other.</text>

<tocase>Ting v Blanche (1993) 118 ALR 543</tocase>
<text>81 Assuming that it can be established that the representations as to future matters were made, it would appear the respondents bear the burden of establishing that there were reasonable grounds for the statements to have been made; Ting v Blanche (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276 at [47] Emmett J suggested that the effect of the section might be more limited:
 
 That is to say, it does not ultimately reverse the onus but simply provides that the deeming takes effect unless [emphasis added] the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary. ... If an applicant elects to adduce no evidence as to that question then the only evidence before the Court would be that adduced by the corporation. Whether that is adequate to establish that the corporation had reasonable grounds for making the representation is a matter for the Court. However once the corporation has adduced some evidence, there is no deeming arising from s 51A(2).</text>

<tocase>Toyota Motor Corporation Australia v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106</tocase>
<text>46 I have no doubt that, viewed objectively, the conduct of Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts suggests that they intended their arrangements to have legal consequences and that a contract was made at the latest when Mr Lewarne paid his $300,000 to Mr Scotts; Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA Inc [2002] HCA 8 ; (2002) 209 CLR 95 at 105-6. It is clear from Mr Dempsey's evidence that they intended to enter into an agreement that had been formally drawn by a solicitor. It may be that they envisaged that this could be done before they needed to commit to a binding arrangement and were prepared to consider the solicitor's advice as to how their relationship should be structured. It is equally clear in my view that this intention was overtaken by events. Mr Scotts' need for funds to meet the imminent settlement of the business purchase from Wellfox intervened. Although not legally sophisticated, both Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts are experienced businessmen. The commercial nature of their activities, their conduct in advancing and receiving money and their active co-operation in the running of a business (discussed in more detail below) all point to them intending to enter into a binding contract; Edwards v Skyways Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 349 at 355; Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106 at 177.

51 In Brambles Holdings at 177, Heydon JA, (also speaking from the Court of Appeal) observed that ' limited recognition has been given to the possibility of finding that contracts exist even though it is not easy to locate an offer or acceptance' (emphasis added). His Honour also noted that the 'offer and acceptance analysis is a useful tool' and approved the comment made by Tadgell J in Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd [1994] 2 VR 106 at 178, that situations where this is not the case are 'likely to be rare'.

52 Nevertheless Heydon JA pointed out, at 176, that there are many circumstances where this analysis does not work well:
 
 One example is a contract for the transportation of passengers on mass public transport ... Another is the contract between competitors in a regatta, they are bound by their conduct in "entering for the race, and undertaking to be bound by [the] rules to the knowledge of each other" ... Another example concerns the exchanges of contracts to sell land, which are hard to analyse in offer and acceptance terms ... Another example concerns simultaneous manifestations of consent ... Another example concerns contracts between numerous parties, or even two parties negotiated at meetings but not assented to until each party executes counterparts. Another is where the contract is made through a single broker acting for both parties. Another is where the parties are deadlocked and they agree to submit to a solution reached by a third party.

53 Where there is no clear evidence of offer and acceptance one must look to the conduct of the parties to determine if they have agreed to incur reciprocal promissory obligations; Toyota Motor Corporation at 178 per Tadgell J. Unlike the circumstances that confronted the Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540, the present issue cannot be resolved primarily as a matter of construction of the relevant documents.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/49.html</AustLII>
<text>72 As partners, Mr Lewarne and Mr Scotts had fiduciary obligations to each other. Even if I am wrong and there was no concluded partnership agreement, the obligations would still arise as is made clear by the comments of Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ in United Dominions Corporations Limited v Brian Proprietary Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 12:
 
 A fiduciary relationship can arise and fiduciary duties can exist between parties who have not reached, and who may never reach, agreement upon the consensual terms which are to govern the arrangement between them. In particular, a fiduciary relationship with attendant fiduciary obligations may, and ordinarily will, exist between prospective partners who have embarked upon the conduct of the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of any partnership agreement have been settled. Indeed, in such circumstances, the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary relationships are likely to be more readily apparent than in the case where mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal agreement.</text>

<text>154 In Wardley Australia Limited v The State of Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525 the High Court held that the word 'by' in this section requires a causal link between the loss or damage suffered and the contravention of the Act: 
 
 ...the word clearly expresses the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it. In this situation, s. 82(1) should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation recently discussed by this Court in March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1989) 15 NSWLR 679</tocase>
<text>79 The question of whether conduct is misleading or deceptive is slightly more nuanced where the representations complained about relate to future matters. McHugh JA noted in Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1989) 15 NSWLR 679 at 690:
 
 'A promise to do something in the future is to be regarded as a representation that it will be performed. It will be deemed misleading, therefore, unless the corporation proves that it had reasonable grounds for making the promise.'

80 Section 51A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) relevantly provides:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation with respect to any future matter, the corporation shall, unless it adduces evidence to the contrary, be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation.'</text>
