<text>21 Thirdly, the appellant complained that the Tribunal found that he could seek the protection of relevant authorities and the legal system in India. It is true that the Tribunal so found. It is impossible to characterise that conclusion by the Tribunal as an infringement of the requirements of s 430. Fourthly, he complained that the Tribunal failed to record the material facts for the reasons referred to above. It seems to me, in light of what I have just said, that that allegation is without substance. In any event, the argument could not be accepted in light of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2000) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

22 Ground five complained that the Tribunal had, by reason of the first three grounds, failed to carry out its review function. It is, of course, true that had the Tribunal failed to carry out its review function that it would have engaged in a jurisdictional excess. However, in the circumstances where I have found each of the other grounds not to have been made out it follows that this ground is not made out either. I should say for completeness that two particulars were provided for ground five. The first was that the Tribunal did not consider that the appellant had been under immense intimidating pressure from the RSS. It seems to me that that is not factually correct. The Tribunal recorded its findings about that. Secondly, it was said that the Tribunal did not consider the appellant's claim that RSS members would kill him if he returned to India. This is factually incorrect. The Tribunal did record that claim and, it seems to me, accepted it as well.

23 The appellant also filed written submissions in which he sought to impugn the Tribunal's conclusion that the confrontations after December 1998 had occurred because of the settlement. I have already rejected that argument. It was then argued that the Court below ought to have held that on the evidence it was open to the Tribunal to find that the appellant was a refugee. There was no occasion for the learned federal magistrate to reach such a conclusion. Her inquiry was limited to the identification of jurisdictional error.</text>

<tocase>Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155</tocase>

<text>11 Secondly, the appellant argued that the Tribunal had failed to make further inquiries in India. Had it done so, the appellant argued that it would have discovered his status in Kerala and it would have more clearly understood the political circumstances surrounding his membership of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the RSS party. Sections 424 and 427 (1)(d) of the Act both permit the Tribunal in its discretion to make further inquiries. However, it has been held that those provisions do not impose, generally speaking, any duty upon the Tribunal to make such inquiries. It may be that the decision of Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 provides the basis for an argument that in certain circumstances the existence of material which clearly calls for explanation or reconciliation may, as a matter of procedural fairness, generate a duty upon a decision-maker to make further inquiries. It is doubtful however whether the principle in Prasad has survived the enactment of s 422B of the Act .

12 At the time of the Tribunal's decision, s 422B provided:
 Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule (1) This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with. (2) Sections 416 , 437 and 438 and Division 7A, in so far as they relate to this Division, are taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters they deal with.

13 That provision is likely to have removed the operation of the Prasad doctrine. In any event, I do not think that the Prasad doctrine would have any applicability to the present facts. There were no circumstances calling for such an inquiry. Accordingly, I reject the argument that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to make further inquiries in India.

14 Thirdly, the appellant argued that if he were now to be returned to India he might be killed. It seems to me that the Tribunal accepted the correctness of that proposition. In that circumstance, it is difficult to discern how there can be a jurisdictional error involved in the Tribunal's treatment of the matter.

15 Fourthly, the appellant argued that the facts which occurred before 1998 were not related to the settlement but occurred for Convention reasons. The Tribunal dealt with that matter by finding that the provisions in s 91R applied to them; in other words, it found that they were insufficiently important to amount to persecution in the relevant sense.</text>
