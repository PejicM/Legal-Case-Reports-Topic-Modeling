<text>On 26 November 2009, I delivered Reasons for Judgment in these matters ( Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1393) ( the principal judgment ). On that day, I reserved all questions of costs for determination on the papers. I directed that the parties file Written Submissions on the question of costs. All parties have now filed Written Submissions.

In the proceeding between it and Flameglow Pty Limited ( Flameglow ), the applicant ( Bitech ) seeks to tender on the question of costs certain correspondence passing between its lawyers (DLA Phillips Fox) and the lawyers for Flameglow. That correspondence is to be found at pp 18 33 of Bitech's Written Submissions on Costs dated 3 December 2009. That correspondence will become Exhibit A in the costs applications.

Flameglow tenders on the question of costs in the proceeding against it a letter from its solicitors (Donaldson Walsh) to DLA Phillips Fox dated 23 May 2008. That letter will become Exhibit 1 in the costs applications.</text>

<tocase>Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1583</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1583.html</AustLII>
<text>It took virtually no part in the final hearing. At [8] in the principal judgment, I said: The unjustified threats Claim will turn on the resolution of the other issues referred to in [6] and [7] above. That Claim was adjourned on 21 October 2008 because Mr Ogilvie, the principal witness to be called by Flameglow in support of that Claim, was ill and could not attend Court when the hearing of the other liability issues took place. The orders made on that occasion and the reasons for them are to be found in Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1583. In addition, Flameglow did not participate to any real extent in the hearing before me. Its participation was confined to seeking to have its unjustified threats claim adjourned and to seeking to read an affidavit sworn by Mr Ogilvie, which I rejected.

After I published the principal judgment, I was informed that, on 2 June 2009, Flameglow had been placed into voluntary liquidation. Although there is no evidence of this fact before me at the moment, both parties have made their submissions on costs upon the basis that Flameglow is now in voluntary liquidation. I will proceed upon the basis that Flameglow was placed into voluntary liquidation on 2 June 2009. In due course, I will need to be satisfied by admissible evidence that this is the fact.

The effect of the voluntary liquidation of Flameglow is that, as and from 2 June 2009, no action or proceeding is to be proceeded with or commenced against Flameglow except by leave of the Court. Leave may be given on such terms as the Court may impose (s 500(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)).

As is apparent from the reasons which I gave on 21 October 2008, when the unjustified threats claim was adjourned (as to which see Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1583) , Senior Counsel for Bitech sought a special order in respect of costs as part of the terms upon which the adjournment requested by Flameglow should be allowed. At that time, I deferred dealing with those submissions but indicated that Bitech's position would be adequately protected.

At the directions hearing held before me on 3 December 2009, Flameglow sought a two week adjournment of the balance of its Cross-Claim in order to allow the liquidators of Flameglow to come to a view as to whether or not that Cross-Claim should now be prosecuted to finality. I agreed to that adjournment but indicated that I expected the liquidators to have come to a firm decision by 16 December 2009, the date to which the matter has been adjourned.

I am not presently dealing with the costs of that part of Flameglow's Cross-Claim which comprises its unjustified threats claim. The costs of that claim will be determined when the balance of Flameglow's Cross-Claim is resolved. Notwithstanding the fact that I am not currently dealing with the costs of the unjustified threats claim, the existence of that claim and its unresolved status are both matters which I am entitled to take into account in determining what orders for costs (if any) I should make at the moment.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/536.html</AustLII>
<text>The notion that Bitech should pay Garth Living's costs on an indemnity basis is based upon Garth Living's contention that Bitech unreasonably rejected a settlement offer made by Garth Living. The relevant principles are to be found in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 234; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 152 153 (per Black CJ) and at 156 158 (per Cooper and Merkel JJ); and in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 at [32] [33] (p 368). In order to justify an order for indemnity costs by reason of the rejection of a settlement offer, the claimant must show that the refusal to accept the offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances at the time when the offer was rejected. The settlement offer relied upon by Garth Living in the present case was made on 11 July 2008 in a letter from Garth Living's lawyers (Eales &amp; Mackenzie) to DLA Phillips Fox dated that day. Omitting formal parts, that letter was in the following terms: 
 Without Prejudice Save as to the Question of Costs 
 Dear Sirs,
 Re: Garth Living Pty Ltd and Anor -ats- Bitech Engineering 
 No. NSD 1681 of 2006 
 The First Respondent/Cross Claimant hereby offers to settle the proceeding inclusive of the Applicant/Cross Respondent's claim, interest and costs, on the following terms ("Offer of Settlement"): 
 
 The Applicant discontinue the proceeding; The Applicant pay to the First Respondent its costs to date in defending the proceeding; The First Respondent discontinue its cross-claim; There be no order as to costs on the cross-claim. 
 
 The Offer of Settlement is open for acceptance in writing until 4.00pm on Friday 25 July 2008 after which time it will expire.
 The Offer of Settlement is made in accordance with the principles applied in Calderbank -v Calderbank (1975) 3 All ER 333 and Cutts -v- Head [1983] EWCA Civ 8 ; (1984) 1 All ER 597 and adopted in the Supreme Court of Victoria in MT Associates Pty Ltd -v- Aqua Max Pty Ltd and Anor (No. 3) (2000) VSC 163 and on the basis of the policy considerations referred to by Hon. Justice Byrne in Mutual Community Limited -v- Lorden Pty Ltd (unreported Supreme Court of Victoria, Byrne J. 28 April 1993 at 12-13) as referred to in Stipanov -v- Mier (No. 2) (unreported Sup. Crt. Victoria, Hollingworth J. 22 November 2006); (2006) VSC 424 , at para 10.
 Should the Offer of Settlement not be accepted by the Applicant, the First Respondent reserves its right to produce this letter to the Court on the question of costs, and to make application to the Court for an award of indemnity costs against the Applicant for all costs of the proceeding from the date of the Offer of Settlement (including any trial).
 Should you require clarification in respect to any aspect of the Offer of Settlement, then please contact me.
 Please confirm receipt of this correspondence.</text>

<text>On 11 July 2008, Bunnings made a further offer of settlement in which it proposed that Bitech should discontinue its proceeding against Bunnings and pay Bunnings' costs of that proceeding. There was no element of compromise in this offer. It cannot assist Bunnings in its claim for indemnity costs (see Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] ; Vasram [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ). Bunnings has not made out a case for indemnity costs.</text>

<tocase>PAC Mining Pty Ltd v Esco Corporation (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 52</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/52.html</AustLII>
<text>At the time the offer of 11 July 2008 was made, all questions of liability in the proceeding had been fixed for final hearing in late October 2008. Although Bitech had not put a positive evidentiary case in answer to Garth Living's Cross-Claim, it had by 11 July 2008 undoubtedly expended some costs in seeking to defeat that Cross-Claim. In its Calderbank offer, Garth Living did not offer to pay Bitech's costs of its Cross-Claim. It should have done so. Nor did Garth Living offer to consent to the issue of a s 19 Certificate of Validity in respect of the Patent (as to which see PAC Mining Pty Ltd v Esco Corporation (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 52 at [11] and at [16]). In those circumstances, I consider that the offer which was made by Garth Living fell well short of what was required in July 2008 to found a claim for indemnity costs.

Further, by 11 July 2008, much of the expert evidence relied upon at the trial had been filed and served. There was a dispute between the parties' experts as to whether reflected light contributed at all to the flame effect observable on the viewing screen and, if so, to what extent and in what way. There was also a contest as to the true construction of the Patent. These issues were not so obviously weighted in favour of the respondent parties that Bitech should be held to have acted unreasonably in rejecting an offer which, in effect, required it to capitulate.

The additional matters to which I have referred in [18] above reinforce my view that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be inappropriate to make an order for indemnity costs in favour of Garth Living.

Bitech seeks its costs of the Cross-Claim brought by Garth Living against it. There was some overlap between the infringement proceeding and the Cross-Claim but not such a significant overlap as to justify a special costs order in respect of that Cross-Claim. As Bitech correctly submitted, the Cross-Claim raised substantial issues as to the validity of the Patent including lack of novelty and obviousness. A good deal of time, effort and expense was devoted to these issues both before and during the hearing. The following remarks made by the Full Court in PAC Mining Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 52 at [11] are apt: In the present case, the appellants might well have defended (and, as things have turned out, successfully defended) the respondents' case on infringement without putting obviousness or novelty in issue. By putting those things in issue, the appellants introduced into the litigation a range of substantial questions which were ultimately decided against them. Although we accept that an issues-based apportionment of costs is not always appropriate, particularly in a case in which conventional alternatives are agitated, the appellants' obviousness and novelty points in the present case were not merely alternative ways of arriving at the conclusion that they had not infringed the patents in suit. They were that, of course, but they were a good deal more: they challenged the basic validity of the patents. As a result of successfully fending off that challenge, the respondents succeeded in obtaining certificates as to validity which have themselves survived the appellants' appeal. In these respects we make no distinction between the appellants' challenge to validity as expressed in their Defence, and their corresponding challenge in the Cross-claim. From the viewpoint of awarding costs, the reality is that, once that challenge was made in both respects, there was a single case, as it were, on obviousness and novelty which the respondents had to meet.

In the present case, I do not think that the issue of fair basis was so significant as to require separate treatment. There will therefore be an order for costs in favour of Bitech in respect of Garth Living's Cross-Claim.

Cohen seeks an order for indemnity costs. It contends that Bitech unreasonably rejected a settlement offer made by its lawyers (Bradley Allen) to DLA Phillips Fox on 4 August 2008. That offer was in the following terms, omitting formal parts: 
 WITHOUT PREJUDICE SAVE AS TO COSTS 
 Dear Sirs
 Cohen Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Garth Living Pty Ltd ats Bitech Engineering Pty Ltd Federal Court No. NSD 1681 of 2006 
 Our client is willing to settle the above proceedings on the basis that the proceedings be discontinued with no order as to costs.
 This offer is put on a Calderbank basis which would be used on the question of costs if not accepted and a judgment is ultimately handed down which is on less favourable terms to your client than this offer.
 If the offer is not accepted within 21 days we will ask for orders that your client not be entitled to be paid costs, other than the costs of considering the offer, incurred after the receipt of the letter and that our client's costs after that time be paid by your clients and further that this be on an indemnity basis.

Bitech ignored this offer.

Cohen ceased all involvement with the MS-5 heater (the only model with which it had a connection) in February 2007. It behaved sensibly in meeting the infringement case against it. It made appropriate admissions.</text>

<tocase>Vasram v AMP Life Ltd [2002] FCA 1286</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1286.html</AustLII>
<text>The offer made by Cohen on 4 August 2008 was made some two and a half months before the trial. It represented some compromise in that it involved an abandonment by Cohen of any entitlement to its costs. This type of compromise will usually not be material when the Court is considering an application for indemnity costs based upon an allegedly unreasonable rejection of a settlement offer ( Vasram v AMP Life Ltd [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ). The offer required Bitech to abandon its claim altogether. The matters mentioned in [18] above are also relevant to my consideration of Cohen's claim for indemnity costs. For all of these reasons, I do not think that Cohen's claim for an order for indemnity costs has been made out.

I do not think that there are any other special circumstances in relation to this proceeding which demand any further departure from the usual rule that the costs should follow the event. I will therefore make orders accordingly.

DLA Phillips Fox holds in its trust account: 
(a) $150,000.00 as security for Garth Living's costs; and
 
(b) $150,000.00 as security for Cohen's costs of the proceedings.

On 11 July 2008, Bunnings made a further offer of settlement in which it proposed that Bitech should discontinue its proceeding against Bunnings and pay Bunnings' costs of that proceeding. There was no element of compromise in this offer. It cannot assist Bunnings in its claim for indemnity costs (see Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] ; Vasram [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ). Bunnings has not made out a case for indemnity costs.</text>
