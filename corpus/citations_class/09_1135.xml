<text>The orders sought in this case are orders refusing to enforce (in the sense of recognising for the purposes of the respondent' damages claim) provisions in the relevant property contracts. The orders sought seem to be similar to orders varying provisions of contracts and that is an order which could be made under s 87(1): see s 87(2)(b). The orders sought, or permissible variations of them, may, in the alternative, or in addition, fall within other paragraphs in s 87(2) (see, for example, s 87(2)(ba)). An order varying the contract price under a contract may be made under the section: Frith v Gold Coast Mineral Springs Pty Ltd [1983] FCA 28 ; (1983) 65 FLR 213 at 241 per Fitzgerald J.

It may be likely that Mr Humphries' case as a whole will stand or fall on his claim for rescission. However, having regard to the wide terms of s 87 and the authorities, it cannot be said that his alternative claim for relief is bound to fail. In other words, it is possible that Mr Humphries will succeed on his claims under the TPA and yet the Court will award the alternative relief claimed by him. In those circumstances, the respondent's challenge must fail. Paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim

The respondents seek an order that paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim be struck out on the ground that it is embarrassing and has a tendency to cause prejudice and delay. Paragraph 56 is in the following terms: 
 
 "Peter Humphries passed on to the applicant the effect of what was being conveyed to him as described in this pleading prior to the applicant entering into the contracts."</text>

<tocase>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) and Others [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/69.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents claim that this alternative claim is not maintainable as a matter of law and should be struck out. They rely on the Court's power in O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules to strike out part of a pleading which discloses no reasonable cause of action. In essence, their argument is that there are no circumstances in which Mr Humphries' claim for rescission would fail and yet his claim for alternative relief would succeed. In my opinion, Mr Humphries' claim for alternative relief is not unarguable in the sense referred to in the authorities ( General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) and Others [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125) and the respondents' application in relation to Mr Humphries' claim for alternative relief must be refused.

As I have said, Mr Humphries claims a right to rescind the property contracts, or an order under s 87 of the TPA that the property contracts have been rescinded, or are rescinded. He then makes the following allegations, in the alternative: 
 
 "106.6 Alternatively an order refusing to enforce the Contracts against the Applicant or alternatively that the Respondents be precluded from maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the market value or the settlement date being before the date on which allotments in Stage 3 commence to be sold or claiming that the Applicant is in default or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to them.
 106.7 In the alternative to paragraph 106.3 above, an order that the First Respondent and the Second Respondent be permanently restrained from calling upon the Bank Guarantees." 
 

 
The claim for relief in paragraph 106.3 is for a declaration that the applicant is entitled to the destruction or return of the bank guarantees.

The claims for relief in paragraphs 106.6 and 106.7 are based on earlier paragraphs which are challenged. Paragraph 82 is in the following terms: 
 
 "82 Alternatively, pursuant to section 87 , an order should be made refusing to enforce the Property Contracts and the second Marina Berth Agreement against the Applicant or alternatively that Newport Quays 2 be precluded from: 
 

 
 
 82.1 maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the Properties being $805,000 for terrace No 44 and $315,000 for sky home No 607;
 82.2 maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the second Marina Berth being $60,000;
 82.3 acting under clause 7.1 to claim that the Applicant is in default under the Property Contracts or the second Marina Berth Agreement or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to Newport Quays."</text>

<tocase>JAD International Pty Ltd v International Trucks Australia Limited (1994) 50 FCR 378</tocase>
<text>The authorities establish that the Court's power to award relief under s 87(1) is not constrained by common law or equitable principles: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 (" Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd ') at 407 [44]. The provisions of s 87 enable a Court to overcome some of the difficulties of the common law including those inherent in deciding whether to rescind or affirm a contract: Mister Figgins Pty Ltd v Centrepoint Freeholds Pty Ltd (1981) 36 ALR 23 (" Mister Figgins ") at 60 per Northrop J. Doctrines such as affirmation or the non-availability of restitutio in integrum which bar rescission in equity are no more than discretionary considerations in the exercise of the power in s 87(1): JAD International Pty Ltd v International Trucks Australia Limited (1994) 50 FCR 378 at 380. An order may be made under s 87(1) where, inter alia, a person is likely to suffer loss or damage and the order may be one that is appropriate to prevent or reduce that loss or damage. This gives the section a wide operation: Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Limited [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494 at 505 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited at 407. Although quite a different case on the facts, the relief granted in Mister Figgins is illustrative of the broad power in s 87(1). Rescission was refused partly on the ground that the innocent party had affirmed the contracts, but nevertheless an order was made under s 87(1) varying the contracts.</text>
