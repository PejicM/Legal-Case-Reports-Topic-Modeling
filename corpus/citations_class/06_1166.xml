<text>It is submitted on the part of the applicant that the decision to proceed failed to comply with the obligations of s 425 in the context of the Act as it then stood and was also a breach of the rules of procedural fairness sufficient to amount to jurisdictional error. I am not satisfied that this was a breach of s 425 of the Act for the reasons explained by Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (NAHF) [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359, particularly at [25] [30]. However, I am satisfied, in the particular circumstances of this case, that what occurred was an unreasonable refusal of an opportunity to present a case sufficient to breach the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness, again as generally explained by Hely J in ( NAHF ) at [31] [39], that reasoning being supported, at least, by the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553. I also refer to the passage relied upon by counsel for the applicant from the judgment of Gummow and Gaudron JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] .</text>
