<text>24 First, in order to constitute a well founded fear of persecution, any threat or relevant risk must be current or prospective, rather than historical only: VBAO 231 ALR 54, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559. However, it is reasonable that a Tribunal should have regard to events that have occurred, to assist in its decision as to whether it is likely that the claimant will in future be subject to persecution. As Brennan CJ and Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ observed in Guo 191 CLR at 575:
 
 "Determining whether there is a real chance that something will occur requires an estimation of the likelihood that one or more events will give rise to the occurrence of that thing. In many, if not most cases, determining what is likely to occur in the future will require findings as to what has occurred in the past because what has occurred in the past is likely to be the most reliable guide as to what will happen in the future. It is therefore ordinarily an integral part of the process of making a determination concerning the chance of something occurring in the future that conclusions are formed concerning past events."</text>

<tocase>NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/10.html</AustLII>
<text>37 Under the Migration Act it not the role of the Court to engage in a review of the merits of the appellant's claims or findings on the facts by the Tribunal: NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] . The appellant has claimed before me as a ground of appeal that the learned Federal Magistrate did not consider the issue before his Honour that physical ill-treatment by an officer of the Israeli Special Forces could by itself amount to serious harm. The first respondent submitted that his Honour did deal with this issue at [18] of his Honour's judgment which reads:
 
 "It was evident from the Tribunal's decision that it individually assessed each of the Applicant's experiences and considered whether each incident of harm amounted to 'serious harm'. Further it considered the incidents cumulatively and despite that matter was not satisfied that the Applicant's experiences amounted to persecution for a convention reason."

38 On the face of para [18] of his Honour's judgment, contrary to the submission of Ms Wheatley, it is not apparent that his Honour has dealt with the issue whether the physical ill-treatment of the appellant could constitute "serious harm". Indeed a general reference to the individual assessment by the Tribunal of each of the appellant's experiences, and a cumulative consideration by the Tribunal of relevant incidents, does not obviously demonstrate a specific consideration of the issue in question by the Federal Magistrate.</text>

<text>39 However as I noted recently in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 , although failure by a court to consider a claim clearly raised by a litigant can give rise to a miscarriage of justice ( QBE Insurance Ltd v Switzerland Insurance Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd (1996) 70 ALJR 281), it is also clear that the ground before his Honour, and raised on appeal before me, was not plainly arguable because no jurisdictional error is apparent from the decision of the Tribunal in relation to this issue. Even if para [18] of his Honour's judgment does not address the issue of physical ill-treatment of the appellant as claimed by the appellant, this is not a reason to allow the appeal from his Honour's decision or to remit the case to the Federal Magistrate for re-hearing because the ground would have no prospects of success.</text>

<tocase>VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1495 ; (2004) 139 FCR 405</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1495.html</AustLII>
<text>16 In that case the claimant was a national of Sri Lanka who claimed that, as a result of his political activities in Sri Lanka, he had received numerous threats to his life from members of an opposition political party. The Tribunal had accepted that the claimant had received intimidating and threatening phone calls and letters, but held these phones calls and letters did not involve serious harm to the claimant. The Tribunal upheld the decision of the delegate of the Minister to refuse a visa to the claimant. The claimant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to have the decision of the Tribunal set aside, wherein the claimant was successful. The Minister then appealed to the Federal Court. In considering s 91R , Marshall J found (his Honour's decision was reported at [2004] FCA 1495 ; (2004) 139 FCR 405) as follows:
 
 "(at 410) Counsel (for the claimant) submitted that the Federal Magistrate was correct to conclude that the making of a threat to life is serious harm for the purpose of s 91R(1)(b). Counsel contended that the apprehension attending a threat to life is the type of psychological injury to which the Refugees Convention is directed...
 ...(at 411) (The RRT) considered that the death threats did not constitute serious harm. In my view this finding was entirely open to the RRT...
 It could not, in my view, have been the intention of Parliament that threats in the form of declarations of intent, could prima facie constitute serious harm. Even with the qualification to s 91R(2)(a) , which the respondent submits must operate to exclude from its scope, threat which do not have the capacity to instil fear, it is clear that that application of the (claimant's) definition would be productive of anomalous consequences...
 ...
 (at 412) Counsel for the respondent contended in written submissions that 'if an applicant fears he or she will lose their life there is no doubt the harm feared would constitute persecution'. That is to elevate the element of fear to an impermissible level. All instances of alleged serious harm have the potential to agitate their victim but this is not the hallmark of their categorisation as instances of serious harm. Rather, serious harm contemplates that a person's livelihood or well-being will be jeopardised in a material way. This is not to deny that threats of the kind directed at the (claimant) can never constitute serious harm, but they do not, of themselves, automatically qualify for that description."

17 Accordingly, his Honour allowed the appeal and re-instated the decision of the Tribunal.

18 On appeal from Marshall J, the High Court considered the meaning of "threat" in s 91R. The findings of their Honours relevant to the proceedings before me include the following:
 
&#8226; In summary Gleeson CJ and Kirby J noted (at 545) that:
 
 
 o the word "threat" can mean either a communication of an intention to harm, or a likelihood of harm
 o section 91R(2)(a) gives, as an instance of serious harm, a threat to the person's life or liberty. The serious harm in question is future harm. Elsewhere in s 91R(2) , the word "threatens" appears three times in a context where it clearly bears the meaning of a likelihood of harm rather than a communication of intention to harm
 o in s 91R(2)(a) it is clear that "threat" is used in the sense of likelihood of harm. 
 
 
 
 
 "A past communication of an intention to harm a person may, or may not, be some evidence that there is a likelihood of future harm to the person's life or liberty, but the question for the decision-maker is whether there is such a likelihood. The decision-maker is required to consider future persecution that involves serious harm, and one instance of such serious harm is a threat to life or liberty. The decision-maker is to decide the risk of future harm, not the risk of future communications."
 
 
 

&#8226; Gummow J said in summary:
 
 
 o it was clear from para 19 of the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 6) 2001 (Cth), which introduced s 91R into the Migration Act , that Parliament intended that the degree of apprehended "harm" feared in the context of claims of persecution should not rise above the level of harm accepted by the parties to the Refugee's Convention as constituting persecution. This is made even more clear by s 91R(1)(b) and (c) (at 547-548)
 o the notion of "serious harm" for the purposes of s 91R(1)(b) is "given further treatment in s 91R(2)" (at 548), which states instances of serious harm for the purpose of s 91R(1)(b) 
 o Counsel for the claimant had urged a reading of s 91R(2)(a) which included a past or current communication of an intention to kill or deprive a person of liberty which, considered objectively, was capable of instilling fear in the person and does so. However the six paragraphs of s 91R(2) should be considered together, taking their colour from the specification of "serious harm" in the opening words of the subsection. His Honour observed: 
 
 
 
 
 "This reading of the whole of the text of s 91R(2) suggests that no less an element of comparable gravity is involved in the stipulation of a threat to the life or liberty of the person in question. More is required than a possibility which is capable of instilling a fear of danger to life or liberty" (at 549)
 
 
 
 
 
 o a "threat" in such circumstances may be an indication of evil to come, but may not have been based upon any direct statement to that person by any official source (at 549). 
 

&#8226; In summary, Callinan and Heydon JJ held:
 
 
 o section 91R is not concerned exclusively with, or applicable to events in the past, rather than current or future circumstances. If any threat or relevant risk is not current or prospective, there can be no well founded fear of persecution (at 555)
 o neither the Refugees Convention nor s 91R of the Migration Act can be read as if a threat of sufficient gravity which has passed, has not been renewed or revived, and is unlikely to be renewed or revived for a Convention reason, will suffice to give rise to the requisite well founded fear (at 555).

19 Accordingly, their Honours dismissed the appeal.

21 In these proceedings the appellant submits that verbal threats, if they are likely to be repeated in the future, are capable, in themselves, of amounting to serious harm for the purposes of s 91(1)(b) depending on the circumstances of the case. In particular, Mr Rangiah for the appellant submitted that:
 
&#8226; the Tribunal accepted that on three separate occasions in 2001, 2002 and 2004 the appellant was detained and threatened by members of the Israeli Special Forces, including verbal threats to the effect that if remained in Israel he would "get a bullet in his head", and the physical threat of having a gun pointed at him
 
&#8226; even if, as the Tribunal found, the Israeli Special Forces did not intend to carry out the threat to shoot him if he remained in Israel, there remained the distinct possibility that similar threats would be made in the future. In this case, however the Tribunal did not consider whether such threats were likely to be made in the future and did not consider whether such threats could, by themselves, amount to "serious harm"
 
&#8226; the making of threats in the future, which are designed to intimidate and frighten and do have that effect, can amount to serious harm within s 91(2)(b). Threats such as pointing a gun and indicating that the person will be shot unless he or she complies with a demand are capable of inflicting serious psychological harm
 
&#8226; in VBAO 231 ALR 54 the High Court did not directly consider the broader issue of whether threats can, in some circumstances, amount to "serious harm" within s 91R(1)(b) 
 
&#8226; section 91R(2) merely provides instances of conduct which may constitute "serious harm"
 
&#8226; Marshall J in VBAO [2004] FCA 1495 ; 139 FCR 405 accepted that verbal threats directed at the respondent can in some cases constitute serious harm, although they do not, of themselves, automatically qualify for that description. The High Court approved the judgment of Marshall J.</text>

<tocase>VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 231 ALR 54</tocase>
<text>15 The leading case considering the term "threat to person's life or liberty" in s 91R is the High Court decision in VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 231 ALR 54. Both Counsel in the proceedings before me addressed issues arising from this case in considerable detail.

20 The key issue arising in respect of grounds 1 and 2 in these proceedings concerns the meaning of "threats" in the context of "serious harm" in s 91R Migration Act . As is clear from perusal of s 91R , Art 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution unless the persecution involves serious harm to the person: s 91R(1)(b). Without limiting the meaning of "serious harm" in the context of s 91R(1)(b) , s 91(2) gives examples of "serious harm", including "a threat to the person's life or liberty" (s 91R(2)(a)). Further, it is clear from the decision of the High Court in VBAO 231 ALR 54 that, as a general proposition, verbal threats will not of themselves constitute serious harm within the meaning of s 91R.

21 In these proceedings the appellant submits that verbal threats, if they are likely to be repeated in the future, are capable, in themselves, of amounting to serious harm for the purposes of s 91(1)(b) depending on the circumstances of the case. In particular, Mr Rangiah for the appellant submitted that:
 
&#8226; the Tribunal accepted that on three separate occasions in 2001, 2002 and 2004 the appellant was detained and threatened by members of the Israeli Special Forces, including verbal threats to the effect that if remained in Israel he would "get a bullet in his head", and the physical threat of having a gun pointed at him
 
&#8226; even if, as the Tribunal found, the Israeli Special Forces did not intend to carry out the threat to shoot him if he remained in Israel, there remained the distinct possibility that similar threats would be made in the future. In this case, however the Tribunal did not consider whether such threats were likely to be made in the future and did not consider whether such threats could, by themselves, amount to "serious harm"
 
&#8226; the making of threats in the future, which are designed to intimidate and frighten and do have that effect, can amount to serious harm within s 91(2)(b). Threats such as pointing a gun and indicating that the person will be shot unless he or she complies with a demand are capable of inflicting serious psychological harm
 
&#8226; in VBAO 231 ALR 54 the High Court did not directly consider the broader issue of whether threats can, in some circumstances, amount to "serious harm" within s 91R(1)(b) 
 
&#8226; section 91R(2) merely provides instances of conduct which may constitute "serious harm"
 
&#8226; Marshall J in VBAO [2004] FCA 1495 ; 139 FCR 405 accepted that verbal threats directed at the respondent can in some cases constitute serious harm, although they do not, of themselves, automatically qualify for that description. The High Court approved the judgment of Marshall J.

24 First, in order to constitute a well founded fear of persecution, any threat or relevant risk must be current or prospective, rather than historical only: VBAO 231 ALR 54, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559. However, it is reasonable that a Tribunal should have regard to events that have occurred, to assist in its decision as to whether it is likely that the claimant will in future be subject to persecution. As Brennan CJ and Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ observed in Guo 191 CLR at 575:
 
 "Determining whether there is a real chance that something will occur requires an estimation of the likelihood that one or more events will give rise to the occurrence of that thing. In many, if not most cases, determining what is likely to occur in the future will require findings as to what has occurred in the past because what has occurred in the past is likely to be the most reliable guide as to what will happen in the future. It is therefore ordinarily an integral part of the process of making a determination concerning the chance of something occurring in the future that conclusions are formed concerning past events."

26 Third, it is clear from VBAO 231 ALR 54 that verbal communication of threats without more does not constitute "serious harm" within the meaning of s 91R(1) or s 91R(2) Migration Act . Mr Rangiah submitted that threats such as pointing a gun at a person's head and indicating verbally that the person will be shot unless he or she complies with a demand can constitute "serious harm". However the Tribunal in its decision thoroughly reviewed the incident including where a gun had been pointed at the appellant and verbal threats made, and considered that this did not constitute serious harm. As I have already said, the High Court in VBAO 231 ALR 54 has held that verbal threats, without more , do not constitute "threats" amounting to serious harm for the purposes of s 91R. It is useful to compare the facts of this case with those in VBAO 231 ALR 54, where the claimant had not only been verbally threatened but also had claimed to have been beaten and had his hair cut by rival political groups, but the court declined to quash the decision of the Tribunal that "serious harm" had not been caused to the claimant. In these proceedings the Tribunal considered the evidence of additional events upon which the appellant relied, but was not satisfied that "serious harm" had been or would be occasioned. This finding was open to the Tribunal on the facts before it.

27 Fourth, although Mr Rangiah also submitted that a series of threats designed to intimidate and frighten could cause serious psychological harm, which would itself be "serious harm", it is for the appellant to make the case of well founded fear of persecution before the Tribunal. On the material before me there appeared to be no evidence that the appellant had sustained such serious psychological harm or would sustain such harm if he returned to Israel.

28 Finally, and notwithstanding Mr Rangiah's persuasive arguments, I am satisfied that the High Court's findings in relation to the meaning of the word "threat" as an instance of serious harm in s 91R(2)(a) Migration Act extend to the concept of threat as "serious harm" within s 91R(1)(b). I do not consider that a "threat" as a species of serious harm for the purposes of s 91R(1)(b) is, for example, of potentially broader application in that section in comparison with its meaning in s 91R(2)(a). The section makes it plain that, in considering serious harm within the meaning of s 91R(1)(b) , while not limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of para (1)(b), regard should be had to the specific instances in s 91R(2). In my view, the findings of the High Court's in VBAO 231 ALR 54 in relation to the meaning of "threat", while specifically referable to s 91R(2(a) , are equally applicable to any concept of "threat" as "serious harm" within the meaning of s 91R(1)(b). To find otherwise would, in my view, ignore the plain meaning of s 91R , the fact that categories in s 91R(2) are clearly meant to assist in the interpretation of s 91R(1)(b) , and the clear findings of their Honours' in VBAO 231 ALR 54.

29 It follows that in my view no jurisdictional error in this respect is apparent from the decision of the Tribunal.

30 The Federal Magistrate similarly found that no jurisdictional error appeared from the decision of the Tribunal, because the Tribunal had applied the correct test in this case in relation to whether verbal threats could constitute "serious harm" within s 91R. In making this finding, his Honour relied on VBAO 231 ALR 54 and the Federal Court decision in VBAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212. His Honour did not, as claimed by the appellant, decide that threats of disappearance and death could not, by themselves, amount to "serious harm". His Honour's findings were limited to the case before him (in particular at [27]-[30]). I find no error in either his Honour's approach or decision in relation to this issue.</text>
