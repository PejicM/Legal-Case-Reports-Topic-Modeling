<tocase>Ngurli Ltd v McCann [1953] HCA 39 ; (1953) 90 CLR 425</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1953/39.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The Court has power in equity and under the Act to set aside a resolution made in circumstances where there has been a fraud on a power by the members ( Ngurli Ltd v McCann [1953] HCA 39 ; (1953) 90 CLR 425 at 438-439 per Williams ACJ, Fullagar and Kitto JJ) or by directors (e.g. Whitehouse v Carlton Hotel Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 11 ; (1987) 162 CLR 285 at 289-290, 293-294 per Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ). The provisions of s 233 give the Court broad powers to make 'any order ... that it considers appropriate in relation to the company'. In their natural and ordinary meaning the introductory words of the section justify the making of an order setting aside a resolution and substituting another. Indeed, s 233(b) contains an express power to modify or repeal a company's constitution. Ordinarily, that could only be done by a special resolution passed by a general meeting. I am of opinion the general power given in the chapeau to s 233 authorises the Court to set aside and substitute resolutions of directors or members. The purpose of s 233 is to enable the Court to remedy a situation brought about by the conduct of members or directors of companies. The remedial power extends to ordering the company to do directly what could have been done by it through the proper exercise by its members or directors of their powers sourced in its constitution or in the Act.</text>

<tocase>Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281</tocase>
<text>35 In Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287 [34] Hely J reviewed the authorities and concluded that conduct of a defendant in failing to accept a Calderbank offer had to be shown by the offeror to be unreasonable in all of the circumstances so as to justify a departure from the normal rule as to costs. Hely J also recognised that while the policy of the law favours the sensible compromise of disputes, there was also a policy against deterring parties from pursuing claims to which they reasonably believed themselves entitled ( Braverus 212 ALR at 289-290 [46]). I am also of opinion that the policy of the law entitles the parties to pursue defences against claims in circumstances where they reasonably believe they cannot achieve a compromise on commercially acceptable grounds.

36 Here, the plaintiffs were seeking to keep their options open in the offers on which they rely. The defendants did not have to accept that stance. The absence of any clear offer capable of acceptance which would have resolved the whole dispute, other than those which the defendants were reasonably entitled not to accept, leads me to conclude that I should dismiss the application for indemnity costs.
 I certify that the preceding thirty six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<tocase>Singleton v Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd (unreported, 22 November 1989; BC8902891)</tocase>
<text>33 During the course of oral argument the plaintiffs referred to the decision of Rogers CJ in Comm D in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Singleton v Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd (unreported, 22 November 1989; BC8902891). There, no offer of settlement had been made under the provisions of the then Pt 22 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) or in the form of a Calderbank letter. However, the plaintiffs there had offered to settle for a sum which was less than ultimately they were found to be entitled to receive. Rogers CJ in Comm D said that during the course of the proceedings it became apparent that the defendant had sought to put in the forefront of its resistance to the plaintiffs' claims an argument or defence that should have been perceived as unsustainable on the evidentiary material (BC8902891 at 12). He pointed out that the provisions in the Court's rules gave substantial guidance on the question of whether an order for indemnity costs should be made. The Chief Judge said (BC8902891 at 16):
 
 'Where, prior to the hearing, a party offers to settle on a basis of an amount less than that ultimately recovered, then, all other things being equal, costs incurred thereafter may be appropriate on an indemnity scale.'

34 While I agree with that expression of principle, the plaintiffs here are unable to point to any offer which they put forward which it was unreasonable for the defendants not to have accepted. Indeed, the only offers on which the plaintiffs rely are the terms of the draft deeds as negotiated and the course of negotiations up to 11 January 2006.</text>
