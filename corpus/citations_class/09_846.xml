<tocase>Barclay Mowlem v Tesrol Walsh Bay [2004] NSWSC 1232</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/1232.html</AustLII>
<text>Two cases relied on by Mr Gould are distinguishable. They are Barclay Mowlem v Tesrol Walsh Bay [2004] NSWSC 1232 and Commissioner of Taxation v Ryan (1998) 82 FCR 345 ( Ryan) . Neither concerned a payment of a final dividend to creditors. Mr Gould's submissions did not refer to the decision of the High Court on appeal in Ryan which, if anything, is unfavourable to his argument (see Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Ryan [2000] HCA 4 ; (2000) 201 CLR 109). The intention to be found in the Trinbay DOCA is that in the absence of an actual payment, it would be a matter for the creditors, or for the Court upon application by a person referred to in s 445D(2), whether the DOCA was to terminate.</text>
