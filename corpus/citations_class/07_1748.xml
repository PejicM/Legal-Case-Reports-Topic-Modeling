<text>1 This is an appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Jarrett ( BRGAB of 2007 v MIAC [2007] FMCA 823) in relation to the appellant's application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa ('a protection visa'). Jarrett FM dismissed the application. Subsequently, a Judge of this Court made an order under Order 80 rule 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Order 80') that the appellant be provided pro bono with legal advice as to her prospects of success in this appeal. The Order 80 stated that, if there were prospects of success, counsel could continue to act generally for the appellant; otherwise the assistance would end.

2 The matter was called on this morning and the appellant has made two applications. The first is an application that I disqualify myself from hearing the matter. The second is an application for adjournment.

3 As to the application that I disqualify myself, the appellant raised four bases.</text>
