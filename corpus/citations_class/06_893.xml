<text>7 On 17 September 2001, the appellant joined the Muin and Lie proceedings in the High Court: see: see Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal ; Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal in [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601. Ultimately, his application was remitted to the Federal Court and was refused on 30 April 2004: see S1775 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 872 per Emmett J. As the first respondent has not sought to rely on those proceedings as the basis of any estoppel argument, it is unnecessary to discuss them further.</text>

<text>10 It is plain from a reading of the Tribunal's reasons that it placed no reliance on the date when he started his bus driving business. The Tribunal relied on the fact that the incident that gave rise to the appellant's protection visa application occurred in 1998, which the appellant does not dispute. It was open to the Tribunal, on the evidence before it, to make the findings it did concerning the appellant's eye condition and medical treatment. The appellant did not dispute that he had authorised the Tribunal to speak to his doctor and that he had been invited by the Tribunal to comment on the doctor's evidence. It is clear from the reasons of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate that the submissions he made to the Tribunal concerning the discrepancy in dates were the same submissions he made to the Federal Magistrate and to me. The Tribunal considered these submissions. The authorities establish that credit issues and findings of fact are generally matters for the Tribunal alone: see NACV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) FCA 411 at [2] ; appeal dismissed in [2002] FCAFC 250 ; also W148/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 679 at [64] . The Tribunal is not obliged to explain its thought processes to an applicant before making a decision. There is no discernible error in his Honour's judgment below.</text>
