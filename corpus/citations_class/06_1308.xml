<text>51 Both McHugh J and Finkelstein J recognised that in cases of this kind the factors referred to by Santow J are cognate with the similar kinds of factors which judges sentencing in criminal matters would take into account in assessing what was the appropriate penalty for that conduct. As Finkelstein J said (145 FCR 65 [33] and see too Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Beekink (2006)57 ACSR 284 at [99] per Nicholson J):
 
 'The sentence must be exemplary and sufficient so that members of the business community are put on notice that if they break the trust which has been reposed in them they will receive a proper punishment. It is vital, not only in the interests of the business community but in the interests of society, that leaders of that community will act honestly in all their dealings. Any slip from the high standards demanded of directors can put at risk the fortunes of their company and also the fortunes (large or small) of those who invest in them. In extreme cases, the misconduct can affect the economy as a whole.'</text>

<text>48 The question for me is whether I am satisfied that the proposed order under s 206E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that Mr Haddad be disqualified from managing corporations for a period of five years is appropriate: N.W. Frozen Foods Pty Limited (No 2) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 298G to 299B per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Limited [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 per Lindgren J. In considering the period of disqualification it appears to me that I should have regard to the 15 propositions formulated by Santow J in Re HIH Insurance Limited (in prov liq) ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at 97 to 99 [56]-[57].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1037.html</AustLII>
<text>50 As the majority of the Court recognised, orders under s 206E are not susceptible of the classification that they are simply protective of the public; they have a punitive effect such that, inter alia, they give a personal defendant the right to claim privilege against self exposure as to penalties (220 CLR at 147 [37]). The effect of that decision was summarised by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard [2005] FCA 1037 ; (2005) 145 FCR 57 at 65 [35] as making clear that a disqualification order can be imposed not only to protect the company's shareholders against further abuse, but also by way of punishment and, importantly, for general deterrence.

<text>48 The question for me is whether I am satisfied that the proposed order under s 206E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that Mr Haddad be disqualified from managing corporations for a period of five years is appropriate: N.W. Frozen Foods Pty Limited (No 2) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 298G to 299B per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Limited [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 per Lindgren J. In considering the period of disqualification it appears to me that I should have regard to the 15 propositions formulated by Santow J in Re HIH Insurance Limited (in prov liq) ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at 97 to 99 [56]-[57].

49 Those factors were summarised by McHugh J in Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 220 CLR 107 at 152-154 [49] as follows:
 
 'The 15 propositions formulated by Santow J are as follows ( Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at 97-99): 
 
 
 
 1. Disqualification orders are designed to protect the public from the harmful use of the corporate structure or from use that is contrary to proper commercial standards. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. The banning order is designed to protect the public by seeking to safeguard the public interest in the transparency and accountability of companies and in the suitability of directors to hold office. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. Protection of the public also envisages protection of individuals who deal with companies, including consumers, creditors, shareholders and investors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. The banning order is protective against present and future misuse of the corporate structure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. The order has a motive of personal deterrence, though it is not punitive. 
 
 
 
 6. General deterrence is an object of the legislation. 
 
 
 
 7. In assessing the fitness of an individual to manage a company, it is necessary that the individual have an understanding of the proper role of the company director and the duty of due diligence that is owed to the company. 
 
 
 
 
 
 8. Longer periods of disqualification are reserved for cases where contraventions have been of a serious nature such as those involving dishonesty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 9. In assessing an appropriate length of prohibition, consideration is given to the degree of seriousness of the contraventions, the propensity of the defendant to engage in similar conduct in the future and the likely harm that may be caused to the public. 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. It is necessary to balance the personal hardship to the defendant against the public interest and the need for protection of the public from any repeat of the defendant's conduct. 
 
 
 
 
 
 11. A mitigating factor in considering a period of disqualification is the likelihood of the defendant reforming. 
 
 
 
 
 
 12. The eight criteria to govern the exercise of the court's powers of disqualification set out in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs (WA) v Ekamper ((1987) 12 ACLR 519) have been influential. It was held that in making such an order it is necessary to assess: 
 
 (a) the character of the defendant; 
 (b) the nature of the breaches; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the structure of the company or companies and the nature of its or their business; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the interests of shareholders, creditors and employees; 
 
 
 
 
 (e) the risks to others from the continuation of the defendant as a director; 
 
 
 
 
 (f) the honesty and competence of the defendant; 
 
 
 
 
 (g) hardship to the defendant and to his or her personal and commercial interests; and 
 (h) the defendant's appreciation that future breaches could result in future proceedings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13. Factors that have led to the imposition of the longest periods of disqualification (that is, disqualifications of 25 years or more) include: 
 
 (a) large financial losses; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) high propensity that the defendant may engage in similar activities or conduct; 
 (c) activities undertaken in fields in which there was potential to do great financial damage such as in management and financial consultancy; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the defendant's lack of contrition or remorse; 
 
 
 
 
 (e) disregard for the law and compliance with corporate regulations; 
 
 
 
 
 (f) dishonesty and intent to defraud; and 
 (g) previous convictions and contraventions for similar activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 14. In cases in which the period of disqualification ranged from 7 years to 12 years, the factors that led to the conclusion that these cases were serious though not the "worst cases", included: 
 
 (a) serious incompetence and irresponsibility; 
 (b) substantial loss; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the fact that the defendant had engaged in deliberate courses of conduct to enrich himself or herself at others' expense, but with lesser degrees of dishonesty; 
 (d) continued, knowing and wilful contraventions of the law and disregard for legal obligations; and 
 (e) lack of contrition or acceptance of responsibility, although that must be weighed against the prospect that the defendant may reform. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15. The factors leading to the shortest disqualifications (that is, disqualifications for up to 3 years) were: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) although the defendant had personally gained from the conduct, he or she had endeavoured to repay or partially repay the amounts misappropriated; 
 (b) the defendant had no immediate or discernible future intention to hold a position as manager of a company; and 
 (c) the defendant had expressed remorse and contrition, acted on advice of professionals and had not contested the proceedings against him or her.'</text>

<tocase>Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>36 So much must be taken from his admission that the declarations are appropriate since in order to be knowingly concerned in order to aid or abet the making of a contravention of s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), s 12DB(1)(c) of that Act, and s 1041H(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), it was essential for Mr Haddad to have had knowledge of the material ingredients of the offence (see Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 667 to 669 per Mason ACJ and Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ).

37 Moreover, I am satisfied that Mr Haddad, on the evidence, did have actual knowledge of the material ingredients of each contravention of the law, the subject of his admissions in the consent declarations.

38 Mr Khoury submitted that Mr Haddad is a young man who had not aimed his conduct at vulnerable persons in the community; he submitted that I should accept that Mr Haddad had not aimed to take advantage of persons who were vulnerable but dealt principally with business people at arms length, and although Mr Haddad's evidence showed that he believed that the policies were underwritten by Zurich, he had been misled into that belief by Mr Dano's evidence. Mr Khoury submitted that Mr Haddad had been cooperative and had complied with Court orders and had not held information back from the Commission or the Court. Mr Khoury submitted that Mr Haddad had been foolish and naive, that he had learned his lesson, that he would not offend again and that he had lost virtually everything as a result of his business and his judgment in involving himself in, among other things, the business the subject of the current proceedings.</text>
