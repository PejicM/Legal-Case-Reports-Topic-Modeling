<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/18.html</AustLII>
<text>There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities.

(ii) Those standards cannot provide an "absolute guarantee" of protection: Hovath , at 510; the measures taken to protect the lives and safety of citizens must be "reasonable": Respondents S152/2003 ; but they cannot be expected to protect against "individual and random" incidents of harm: at [119].

(iii) There must be a reasonable willingness and ability by the State and its agents to invoke those laws and mechanisms against the perpetrators of violence: Respondents S152/2003 at [21]; Hovatt , at 511; and this may necessitate examining how State agents act at a "local level" regardless of the State's "leaders' good intention": see SZAIX at [37].

(iv) If the State or its agents condone, approve, tolerate: Khawar , [31]; or are indifferent to: Respondents S152/2003 at [119]; the criminal conduct concerned, or are unwilling or unable to afford protection: Horvath at 510-511; Khawar , at [29] 
 ... then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state [or its agents]: Khawar, at [31].

Having regard to what was said by members of the High Court in Khawar and in Respondents S152/2003 the Tribunal perceived its task to be that (Reasons [85]): 
 I am required to consider whether the applicant has shown State Tolerance or condonation of domestic violence in Vanuatu. Further to that, or as part of that analysis, I am required to consider whether Vanuatu provides its citizens, or the members of the particular social group more specifically, with a reasonable level of protection from persecutory conduct. In assessing the level of protection offered, and assessing whether it is reasonable, I am required to assess that in accordance with international standards.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar (2002) 210 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities.

(iv) If the State or its agents condone, approve, tolerate: Khawar , [31]; or are indifferent to: Respondents S152/2003 at [119]; the criminal conduct concerned, or are unwilling or unable to afford protection: Horvath at 510-511; Khawar , at [29] 
 ... then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state [or its agents]: Khawar, at [31].

(v) Proof merely of maladministration, incompetence or ineptitude of State agents would not convert personally motivated domestic violence into persecution on one of the grounds set out in Art 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention: Khawar at [26].

The issue in this appeal, as it was in Khawar and SZAIX , relates to proposition (iv) above.

Having regard to what was said by members of the High Court in Khawar and in Respondents S152/2003 the Tribunal perceived its task to be that (Reasons [85]): 
 I am required to consider whether the applicant has shown State Tolerance or condonation of domestic violence in Vanuatu. Further to that, or as part of that analysis, I am required to consider whether Vanuatu provides its citizens, or the members of the particular social group more specifically, with a reasonable level of protection from persecutory conduct. In assessing the level of protection offered, and assessing whether it is reasonable, I am required to assess that in accordance with international standards.

I should at the outset deal with one factual circumstance in this matter which differs from the circumstances in Khawar (which also was a domestic violence case). In Khawar the abused woman went to the police on four occasions to report the violence and no action was taken by them. In the present matter the appellant, to quote the Tribunal, "not once has ... sought the protection of the police to test [her] presumption" (ie that the authorities would not provide her with a reasonable level of protection). Some significant, though unstated, importance appears to have been given to this failure: see Reasons [86].

If the Tribunal was suggesting that actually seeking the protection of the authorities was a prerequisite for a finding of absence of adequate State protection, then it clearly was in error. If cultural norms, practices or widely held assumptions in a particular society engender a reasonable apprehension that such an approach would only exaggerate a victim's predicament, I can see no conceivable reason why the law would require a victim to expose herself to likely future harm to substantiate that she was being persecuted for Convention purposes.

This in turn leads to a larger issue which reveals what is a major silence in the Reasons. While the Tribunal was aware that Vanuatu was "attempting to grapple with domestic violence" and has pursued reforms in its laws and has instituted new mechanisms, the Reasons themselves engage in no explicit evaluation of the efficacy of those mechanisms or of the traditional cultural norms and practices which, both on the appellant's case and in light of the country information, might bear on the police's willingness or ability "to take reasonable measures to protect the ... safety" of victims of domestic violence. I would emphasise in this, for example, the evidence of the role of chiefs in settling family and domestic violence disputes and of the police's utilisation of the chiefs. The absence of evaluation I have noted seems the more surprising given the Tribunal's treatment of country information a treatment which simply diluted the potential significance of what the reports clearly were intending to convey. So the State Department report that "courts occasionally prosecuted offenders using common-law assault" is expressed as "there are laws of general application against assault under which the perpetrators of domestic violence have been prosecuted". Likewise the Tribunal's observation that the country information "provides some support" for the appellants information suggesting "that the police are, in some circumstances, reluctant to intervene in domestic matters", rather mutes, for example, the State Department's comment that "police frequently were reluctant to intervene" or Freedom House's comments to like effect.</text>

<tocase>Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 1 AC 489</tocase>
<text>There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities.

(i) It is the obligation of a State to provide an adequate or reasonable armoury of laws and other mechanisms capable of providing international standards of protection: Respondent S152/2003 at [27]; Horvath , at 510; against the perpetration of violence on its citizens: Respondent S152/2003 , at [26].

(iv) If the State or its agents condone, approve, tolerate: Khawar , [31]; or are indifferent to: Respondents S152/2003 at [119]; the criminal conduct concerned, or are unwilling or unable to afford protection: Horvath at 510-511; Khawar , at [29] 
 ... then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state [or its agents]: Khawar, at [31].

I make the above comments, not because I consider that, as a matter of merits review, a different conclusion would have been preferable. Merits review, as is well accepted, is no part of the Federal Magistrates Court function in judicial review proceedings under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 . Rather, when one has regard (i) to the material before the Tribunal; (ii) to the issues raised by the appellant's case as to whether the police would be unwilling or unable to provide her with effective protection; and (iii) to the content and emphases of the Tribunal's reasons, I consider the only proper inference to be drawn: cf Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360; is that, howsoever the Tribunal may have formulated its task, it did not appreciate the actual nature of, nor did it undertake, the legal inquiry it was required to undertake as to whether the protective measures which it considered were available in Vanuatu, were ones the State's agents were willing or able to utilise in providing protection. The reasons do not suggest any adequate or reasonable consideration of that issue at all and that was the issue before it on the appellant's case.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<text>I am in the circumstances satisfied that the Tribunal's failure properly to consider whether the police were unwilling or unable to afford State protection constituted jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [82] . I likewise am satisfied that the decision of the Federal Magistrate disclosed an appellable error.

Accordingly, I will order that: 
1. The appeal be allowed.
 
2. The orders of Lindsay FM made on 3 March 2009 be set aside and in lieu thereof:
 
 2.1 An order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Second Respondent signed on 4 October 2008 and sent on 15 October 2008 in RRT Case Number 0802686.
 
 2.2 An order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Second Respondent to review the decision made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 17 April 2008 according to law.
 
 2.3 An order that the First Respondent pay the Appellant's costs of the application.
 The First Respondent pay the Appellant's costs of the appeal. 
 I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.
