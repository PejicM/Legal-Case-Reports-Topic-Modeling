<text>On 10 January 2001, a Mr Horst Fischer was issued with a fishing permit which had a quota allocation calculated in accordance with his catch history. He challenged the Authority's decision in the Tribunal on the ground that the policy applied by the Authority in determining the quota allocation was unfair because it ignored the fact that, in practice, permits were transferred and had a capital value. Mr Fischer was successful before the Tribunal and an appeal to this Court by the Authority was dismissed ( Re Fischer and Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2002] AATA 857 ; (2002) 71 ALD 665 ; Australian Fisheries Management Authority v Graham [2003] FCA 231 ; (2003) 127 FCR 436).

<text>The first respondent's submission that the Panel may, for the purposes of reviewing the decision, exercise a power or discretion conferred on the Authority even where the Authority did not exercise the power or discretion is correct: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Donald [2003] FCAFC 318 ; (2003) 136 FCR 7 at 15 [29] - [30] per Kenny J. That is so, it seems, even where the original decision-maker, in reaching the decision it did, was not bound to consider the exercise of the particular power or discretion: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [1992] FCA 338 ; (1992) 37 FCR 32. However, these principles do not assist the first respondent's argument because, for the reasons I have given, the Authority did not have the power or discretion to vary or revoke a condition attached to the first respondent's fishing permit in the course of making the decision it did.</text>

<tocase>Fischer and Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Re; Tapley and Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Re; [2005] AATA 936 ; (2005) 41 AAR 417</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2005/936.html</AustLII>
<text>The buy-back scheme was introduced in 2001 and, under the scheme, the Commonwealth made offers to buy back fishing permits held by operators who did not wish to participate in the move from regulation by input controls to regulation by output controls. The buy-back scheme was described by Downes J in Re Fischer and Australian Fisheries Management Authority ; Re Tapley and Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2005] AATA 936 ; (2005) 41 AAR 417 , a decision I discuss below, in the following terms (at 431 [67]): 
 
 "There was, however, a legal market which does provide some evidence of market value. Prior to the introduction of quotas, operators were given the opportunity to take part in a buy-back scheme. AFMA established an adjustment assistance program for those who did not wish to change to the proposed scheme of output controls. Under the scheme operators were paid $8000 per gillnet unit for gillnet permits and $25 per hook for hook permits. Forty permit holders took part in the scheme. They gave up their fishing permits but they retained the right to allocation of quota. However, the quota could not be utilised otherwise than by transfer or by acquisition of a fresh fishing permit. Under the new scheme the quota allocated could be sold to someone with a permit. Although the buy back does not amount to an open market it was voluntary and does provide some evidence of the value of permits severed from the quota entitlements about to be introduced. I note that at the time of the buy-back the Jenkinson panel had already announced its proposal that quota should be based on catch history."

The first respondent was one of the forty permit holders who participated in the buy-back scheme which was known as the Southern Shark Industry Development Program. His participation in the scheme included an application by him dated 6 February 2001 to surrender his fishing permit in the Southern Shark Fishery pursuant to s 32(9) of the FM Act. On the same day, that is, 6 February 2001, the first respondent executed a Deed of Release.

The application by the first respondent to surrender his permit contained the following: 
 
 "I acknowledge that the effect of this surrender is that my having held a permit in the Southern Shark Fishery and South East Non Trawl Fishery will not be a consideration in any future decision by AFMA in relation to an application by me for a permit in this fishery. 
 

 
 
 I further acknowledge that my having held permits in the Southern Shark Fishery and South East Non Trawl Fishery or the catch history associated with such permits, will not be a consideration in any allocation of quota decisions apart from decisions in relation to the grant of quota for school shark and gummy shark."

Mr Horst Fischer and Mr Graham Tapley applied to the Tribunal for review of the quota allocations allocated to them for the 2004 calendar year. Their ground was that "the decision should have allocated quota wholly by reference to the permit itself, taking no account of catch history, or should have placed much less emphasis on catch history" ( Re Fischer and Australian Fisheries Management Authority ; Re Tapley and Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2005] AATA 936 ; (2005) 41 AAR 417 at 421 [12] per Downes J). I will refer to this proceeding as the Fischer No 2 proceeding. The first respondent was added as a party to the application for review. Downes J expressed his conclusions on the review as follows (at 438-439 [107]): 
 
 "Two applications are before the Tribunal. They challenge quota allocations for the year 2004 for gummy and school shark allocated to Horst Fischer and Graham Tapley. No grounds specific to Messrs Fischer and Tapley are relied upon. Messrs Fischer and Tapley say that the quota should not be determined by reference to the quantity of shark they had caught in the past. They say that equal quota should be awarded to all operators holding the same permits. I have found that the quota system under review by which quota calculations are based partly upon equality between permits, representing the right to fish, or access entitlement, and partly upon catch history, is the preferable way to allocate quota. I have also found that the way the two have been integrated are the appropriate and preferable methods."

As to the first respondent, Downes J said (at 436 [88]): 
 
 "Trevor Gilmore took part in the buy-back. Under the Fischer and Tapley proposal he would not be entitled to any quota because he no longer has a permit. Persons who took part in the buy-back were informed they would be entitled to quota. The quota allocation under review will give persons such as Mr Gilmore an entitlement to quota although less than under the Jenkinson Panel scheme. The system under review seems to me to be appropriate for persons who took part in the buy-back."

The events leading up to the decision made by the Authority are as follows.

By a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette of 21 December 2006, the Authority invited interested persons to apply to be registered as eligible persons for the grant of SFRs for shark species under the Management Plan. The notice was given under s 24 of the FM Act. After the registration period had closed, a register of persons eligible for the grant of SFRs was finalised.</text>

<tocase>Jadwan Pty Ltd v Secretary, Department of Health and Aged Care [2003] FCAFC 288 ; (2003) 145 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/288.html</AustLII>
<text>Neither the Authority, nor the Panel, had a general discretion to depart from the provisions of the Management Plan. The provisions of the FM Act and the Management Plan are clear. Section 29(3) of the FM Act provides that the selection process is to be carried out in accordance with the procedures specified in the Management Plan. Put another way, that means in conformity with procedures which, it is envisaged by the FM Act, will be laid down in the Management Plan. Full particulars of those procedures are to be specified in the notice under s 24 of the FM Act which starts the process whereby SFRs are to be granted (see s 25(b)). The Management Plan is quite clear in the procedures it specifies. It would have been open to the makers of the Management Plan to confer a general discretion but they did not do that. Section 27 of the Management Plan deals with eligibility for registration and does so by reference to the quota units a person is authorised to take. The authorisation to take is the fishing permit. Section 28(2)(j) of the Management Plan sets out the formula to be applied and it is even more explicit. It refers to what a person was authorised to take in the fishery in accordance with a fishing permit held by the person immediately before the end of the notice period. The matter is put beyond any doubt by s 25 of the Management Plan which links the quota units which are to be translated directly to the units specified in the permit and registered in the Register. The relevant fact is the number of quota units specified in the fishing permit and Register, not what the number of quota units might be after a review as to the merits ( Jadwan Pty Ltd v Secretary, Department of Health and Aged Care [2003] FCAFC 288 ; (2003) 145 FCR 1). I would also note that a general discretion to examine entitlement by examining the merits of a condition attached to a fishing permit may lead to delay and that does not appear to be contemplated by the process envisaged by ss 24-31 inclusive of the FM Act and the relevant provisions of the Management Plan.

In my opinion, these considerations also lead to a rejection of the narrower submission that it was open to the Panel to exercise the power in s 32(8) of the FM Act. There is an additional reason why this submission must fail. The power to make a decision as to the availability of a grant of SFRs is dealt with in a different section of the FM Act (s 29(3)) from the power to make a decision to vary or revoke a condition attached to a fishing permit (s 32(8)). The decisions are subject to different review procedures, the first is subject to review by the Panel under s 142 and the second is subject to review by the Tribunal under s 165. The first respondent had the opportunity to challenge the quota allocation attached to his fishing permit by seeking review by the Tribunal. He may, in fact, have exercised that right by his involvement as a party in the Fischer No 2 proceeding. However, I do not need to decide that question because the important point is that the FM Act provides for a separate procedure for such challenge.</text>

<tocase>Lamason v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 245</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/245.html</AustLII>
<text>The Authority may make plans of management under the FM Act. They are legislative instruments under the FM Act ( Lamason v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 245 at [149] - [150] per Spender J). The process by which plans of management are made and the information or material they may contain are dealt with in ss 17-20 inclusive of the FM Act. A plan of management is relevant in this case and it is the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery Management Plan 2003. The plan commenced on 1 October 2003 and it has been amended twice. I will refer to it as the Management Plan.

The FM Act deals with the granting of statutory fishing rights. There are a number of steps involved in the process. In a case where a grant of a statutory fishing right is not to be conferred by auction or tender, the FM Act provides that the relevant management plan will set out the procedures for determining the person to whom a grant is to be made available (s 29(3) of the FM Act).

There are a range of decisions the Authority is required to make under the FM Act. A number of them may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). Section 165 of the FM Act grants rights of review from decisions of the Authority. The decisions which may be reviewed include a decision by the Authority under s 32 of the FM Act, that is to say, a decision to grant a fishing permit or a decision to impose a particular condition on a fishing permit.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>As I have said, for completeness and in case there is a further appeal, I will set out my conclusions as to the approach taken by the Panel. I bear in mind that the Panel's reasons are not to be construed minutely and with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.

The Panel was under an obligation to give each party a written statement setting out its decision and the reasons for its decision (s 160 of the FM Act). The Authority submits that the Panel was also under the obligation as to reasons contained in s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). I do not need to deal with that submission because I have reached a clear conclusion about the Panel's reasons without having to rely on the Authority's submission based on that section.

In my opinion, the Panel did not proceed by reference to the power in s 32(8) of the FM Act. It proceeded on the basis that there was a general discretion to depart from the provisions of the Management Plan. There is no reference in the Panel's reasons to s 32(8) of the FM Act. There is no reference to the fact that the Authority did not address the power in s 32(8). There is no reference to the question whether, in those circumstances, it was open to the Panel to exercise the power in s 32(8) having regard to its powers in s 142 and s 150 of the FM Act. There is no reference to the question whether, in selecting the person to whom a grant is to be made available, it is open to the decision-maker to in effect exercise the power in s 32(8) of the FM Act before exercising the power of selection. There is no reference to the particular merits of exercising or not exercising the power in s 32(8). I have considered the matters to which the first respondent referred, including the matters in the transcript, but none of them persuade me that the Panel considered it was exercising the power in s 32(8) of the FM Act. The Panel made its decision on the basis that it was free to depart from the provisions of the Management Plan where it would be unreasonable not to do so.</text>

<text>The first respondent's submission that the Panel may, for the purposes of reviewing the decision, exercise a power or discretion conferred on the Authority even where the Authority did not exercise the power or discretion is correct: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Donald [2003] FCAFC 318 ; (2003) 136 FCR 7 at 15 [29] - [30] per Kenny J.

<tocase>Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2000/79.html</AustLII>
<text>There was a good deal of debate before me as to whether the power in s 32(8) to vary or revoke a condition attached to a fishing permit could only be exercised during the period of the permit and for a purpose related to the fishing activities undertaken, or to be undertaken pursuant to the permit. That question raises difficult issues which I will refrain from addressing because it is not necessary for me to do so. I would only say that the decision to which the first respondent referred, Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79 , is, with respect, of no real assistance because it is a decision dealing with quite a different statutory scheme (see at [30]-[41] per Wheeler J).</text>
