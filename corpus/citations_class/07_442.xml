<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>9 The High Court considered the principles applicable to the grant of an interlocutory injunction in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457. At [65] , Gummow and Hayne JJ applied Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622-3 where it was observed that the two main enquiries are as follows:
 
 'The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief...The second inquiry is...whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.'

10 GenRx must show sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. This depends on the nature of the rights and the practical consequences likely to flow from the orders sought ( O'Neill at [65] [72] per Gummow and Hayne JJ). It is in this context that the formulation "serious question to be tried" has effect when the Court asks whether an applicant has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the applicant's entitlement to relief, that the applicant is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction ( O'Neill at [19] per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J). In considering the balance of convenience, the Court may take into account whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if the injunction is granted to a party who fails to establish its right at trial or in failing to grant an injunction to a party who succeeds at trial ( Bradto Pty Ltd v State of Victoria [2006] V ConvR 54-722 at [35]).

18 I accept that there is a serious question in the O'Neill sense.

19 There is little evidence on the number of advertisements presently "in the pipeline" or the difficulties faced by Servier if it were ordered not to place further advertisements asserting improved stability. I conclude that no serious inconvenience or injustice would be suffered if no further advertisements referring to stability were to be placed until further order.

20 It is therefore appropriate that Servier be prohibited from placing any further advertisements containing the reference to "improved stability" until further order.</text>
