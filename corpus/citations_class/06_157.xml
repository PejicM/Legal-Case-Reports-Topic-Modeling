 SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 
1 I delivered reasons for judgment in this matter on 24 February 2006 ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd (ACN 095 154 108) (in liquidation) [2006] FCA 146) and stood the matter over until today to enable orders to be made. My attention has been drawn to the fact that I did not explicitly deal with the form of order for compensation to be made in respect of Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited insofar as there was a claim for contingent loss.

3 I am satisfied that the terms of s 87 are wide enough to authorise the inclusion of orders which have the effect of indemnifying Carlon Pty Limited from claims by the sub-distributors. Burchett J made a similar order in Oraka Pty Ltd v Leda Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-558. That judgment was set aside on appeal but not because of any fault in the relief granted ( Leda Holdings Pty Ltd v Oraka Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-601). Beaumont J, who dissented in the Full Court, expressly approved that order (at 40,509). It was supported by the authorities referred to by Burchett J. (See also State of Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 261 and Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 545). Whether such an order should be made is for the discretion of the Court in each case.</text>
