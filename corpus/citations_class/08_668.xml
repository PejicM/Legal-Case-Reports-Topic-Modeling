<text>16 In my view, there can be no real doubt that the effective or operative decision was the second decision. First, it was a review or reconsideration of the first decision; second, it was made by a delegate of the Deputy Commissioner who, at the relevant time, was at a higher level to the delegate of the Deputy Commissioner who made the first decision: see Amcor Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1988) 79 ALR 221 at 226; Corinthian Industries (Syd) Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs &amp; Ors (1989) 86 ALR 387 at 388; Universal Magazines Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs [1990] FCA 244 ; (1990) 21 ALD 502 at 503, 504; and Post Office Agents Association Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Postal Commission (1988) 84 ALR 563 at 571.</text>

<tocase>Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 51 ATR 1</tocase>
<text>19 Subsections 8AAG(3) and 8AAG(4) are true alternatives. Subsection 8AAG(5) is intended to cover cases which are not within subs (3) and (4): Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 51 ATR 1 at [45].

20 The Commissioner is required to reach a state of satisfaction as to the elements in subss 8AAG(3), (4) and (5).

21 If the Commissioner is satisfied as to the matters referred to in one of the subsections, then the Commissioner is required to remit all or part of the GIC. Use of the expression 'the Commissioner may remit' the GIC if satisfied as to specified matters, does not confer a residual discretion not to remit all or part of the GIC: Webb v Commissioner of Taxation (No. 2) [1993] FCA 612 ; (1993) 27 ATR 459 at 469; followed in Elias at [46]. On the other hand, the expression '... all or a part of the charge ...' gives the Commissioner a residual discretion as to how much of the charge is remitted even if he is satisfied as to the specified matters in subs 8AAG(3), (4) or (5).

22 Subsections 8AAG(4)(c) and 8AAG(5)(a) require the Commissioner to be satisfied that it would be 'fair and reasonable' to remit all or part of the GIC. In determining the issue whether it would be fair and reasonable to remit the GIC, the Commissioner is entitled to take into account in the exercise of that discretion the policy of the TAA that additional tax is payable as at a certain date. That is a matter to be weighed in determining the fairness and reasonableness of remission: Webb at 469, followed in Elias at [47].</text>
