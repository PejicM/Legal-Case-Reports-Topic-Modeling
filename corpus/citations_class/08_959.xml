<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/1099.html</AustLII>
<text>1 This is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on 11 July 2007 dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('Tribunal'): SZJRW &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1099. On 19 October 2006, the Tribunal published its decision to affirm a decision of the delegate of the first respondent ('the Minister') to refuse to grant each appellant a protection visa under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').

2 Appellant SZJRW, the primary appellant, is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('China') who sought a protection visa based upon a contended well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of his participation in protests against the government of China, that is, by reason of his political opinion. Appellant SZKEM is his wife and sought a protection visa as a family member of the primary appellant.

3 In these reasons, I will use the term 'the appellant' as a reference to the circumstances, findings and contentions concerning the primary appellant unless otherwise apparent.</text>

<text>48 The appellant says a proper inference can not be drawn from the country information relied upon by the Tribunal that an applicant for a passport is of no interest to PRC authorities on grounds of prior protest conduct for reasons of political opinion, simply because the applicant obtains a passport and achieves an objective of lawfully leaving China. However, five things should be noted. First, the Tribunal was entitled to prefer the country information it obtained and rely upon it in discharging its fact-finding role ( NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 [11] and [41], relying upon VTAG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 91 ; (2005) 141 FCR 291 and VAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 161 at [25] ). Secondly, the finding is primarily supported by the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's evidence. Thirdly, the appellant accepted that he had not engaged in protest activity and explained the conjunction of circumstances causing that to be so. Fourthly, even if no proper inference arises out of the older country information, the Tribunal did not act on 'no evidence' in reaching its finding as evidence (that is, the appellant's own evidence) supported the finding. Fifthly, the question of whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law just as whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, clearly enough, there is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact. In addition, even if the reasoning upon which the decision-maker reached its conclusion of fact is demonstrated to be unsound, that would not amount to error of law ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2002) 65 ALD 141 per Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ at [34]). Even if it is accepted that the earlier country information did not support an inference drawn by the Tribunal, there was nevertheless evidence before the Tribunal supporting the findings of fact.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/17.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The Tribunal's reference to the country information upon which it relied is said to reflect a less rigorous standard for assessing prospective risk and reflects an approach on the part of the Tribunal of simply relying upon out of date and irrelevant information rather than an inquiring or analytical approach to the question before it. Two things should be noted about this contention. First, it is clear from the Tribunal's reasons that it comprehensively reviewed all of the evidence both in terms of the appellant's written evidence and the evidence of the witnesses at the hearing. Thus, the Tribunal did not simply rely upon 'old decision templates'. Rather, the Tribunal asked itself whether it could be satisfied on all the material that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason should he return to the PRC. Secondly, to the extent that the appellant's contention raises the notion of bias on the part of the Tribunal, there is no basis for such a ground of challenge. There is no evidence of pre-judgment by the Tribunal ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 , per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J at [71] and [72]). If the contention is one of apprehended bias rather than actual bias, no fair-minded lay observer examining the reasons of the Tribunal could reasonably apprehend bias ( Re Refugee Review Tribunal &amp; Anor; Ex parte H &amp; Anor [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [27] - [32]; Ebner v Official Trustee [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 176 ALR 644 at 647 at [6] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (No. 2) [2006] FCA 392 ; (2006) 151 FCR 160).</text>
