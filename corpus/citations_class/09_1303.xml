<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/30.html</AustLII>
<text>The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal accurately set out the appellant's claims and evidence before it and the further material provided by the appellant and his representative in October 2007 and January 2008 but noted that it did not make findings on all the issues raised in the material when it rejected the entirety of the appellant's evidence and case because of its adverse credit findings: par [9] above. The Federal Magistrate said that: The Tribunal roundly disbelieved the appellant because of the matters set out in par [9] above and that each of those matters were findings that it was open to the Tribunal to make; Those matters were in the scheme of things important matters which were not peripheral to the issues before the Tribunal, including the very important credit issues. Once the Tribunal found that it did not believe the appellant in relation to these matters it was not illogical for the Tribunal to form the view that the entirety of the appellant's evidence about his conversion was untrue. Once the Tribunal decided that it did not believe the appellant, it was open to the Tribunal simply not to believe any of the rest of his evidence, applying the approach adopted in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at par [49] and WADU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1252 at par [45]. 
 
The Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the reasons the Tribunal gave were sufficient, relying on Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at pars [65]-[67].

Counsel for the appellant criticised the Tribunal for focussing on the manner in which the appellant came to Australia, namely as an occupational trainee, rather than examining whether the appellant was a genuine convert to Christianity. Counsel relied upon the reasoning in NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 and submitted that the present case was an example of the observations of the Full Court at par [115]: 
 
 "By and large fact-finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 ; 73 ALD 1 ; [2003] HCA 30. Where fact-finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described, as here, as in substantial respects unreasoned, and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation, at times as plainly and ex facie wrong and as selective of material going one way, these considerations may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might, or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. ..."

Having rejected the fundamental basis of the appellant's claims, it was not necessary for the Tribunal to make specific findings or reach specific conclusions in relation to other aspects of the evidence of the appellant, such as the letters from clerical persons in Nigeria and Australia supporting his claims, and the Special Rapporteur's Report as the Tribunal found they were outweighed by "serious flaws" in the appellant's evidence. As Gleeson CJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (supra) at par [12]: 
 
 "It was contended that this passage shows that the tribunal member adopted a flawed approach to her evaluation of the evidence, failing to assess the evidence of the applicant/appellant in the light of the corroborating evidence, and giving no weight to the evidence of the corroborating witness for reasons that had nothing to do with the quality of that evidence. The essence of the complaint is that the tribunal failed to consider the evidence as a whole, but first considered, and disbelieved, the evidence of the applicant/appellant, without taking account of the corroboration, and then considered and rejected the corroboration because of the rejection of the evidence of the applicant/appellant. I do not accept that this is a fair criticism of the tribunal's reasons. In my view, all that the member was saying was that, for reasons already given at length, she found the applicant/appellant's story implausible, and in some important respects unbelievable, and that she also rejected the evidence of the corroborating witness, even though she had no separate reason to doubt his credibility other than the reasons that she had already given for rejecting the claim she was considering. The member could have expressed herself more clearly. It is not necessarily irrational, or illogical, for a finder of fact, who is convinced that a principal witness is fabricating a story, which is considered to be inherently implausible, to reject corroborative evidence, even though there is no separate or independent ground for its rejection, apart from the reasons given for disbelieving the principal witness."

The Tribunal did not ignore or disregard the appellant's claim or the evidence upon which he relied. In the section of its decision headed "CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE" the Tribunal set out in considerable detail the claims and evidence upon which the appellant relied. In particular the Tribunal noted that the appellant feared persecution because he was a convert. It is also clear from this section of the Tribunal's decision that it included in its consideration the Tribunal's Guidelines on Credibility. The Tribunal referred to them in its decision and was not obliged to comply strictly with the guidelines given that they are not statutory in nature. In any event, failure to comply with the guidelines does not give rise to an apprehension of bias. It is also clear that the Tribunal took into account and had before it in the consideration of its decision the psychologist's report which, according to the Tribunal: 
 
 "Stated that he will have difficulty presenting his case well at an RRT hearing. He is likely to become anxious and confused. He has trouble remembering dates and incidents."</text>

The Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the reasons the Tribunal gave were sufficient, relying on Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at pars [65]-[67].

These findings were squarely within the province of the Tribunal. As McHugh J said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (supra) at par [67], a finding on credibility "is the function of the primary decision-maker par excellence".

Counsel for the appellant accepted that the Tribunal had to be satisfied that the appellant was a genuine convert and criticised the Tribunal for not asking one question during the hearing about the appellant's knowledge of Christianity. It was submitted that the Tribunal misdirected itself by focussing on how the appellant came to Australia and the circumstances surrounding his occupational training visa. It followed, said counsel for the appellant, that the Tribunal could not have been in a position to be satisfied that the appellant was not a genuine convert without having examined that fundamental issue. This submission, even if it be correct as a matter of factual analysis of what the Tribunal did, does not give rise to a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. The fact finding and assessment of credibility is quintessentially the task for the Tribunal. It is not for the Court, on review, to dictate to the Tribunal the method by which it is to undertake its factual analysis and assessment of the credibility of an applicant.

The Tribunal may not have asked a specific question about a specific aspect of the appellant's knowledge of Christianity, but what is clear from a reading of the transcript of the hearing and listening to the audio recording of the hearing is that the Tribunal asked the appellant questions relating to his activities and actions as a Christian. The Tribunal asked the appellant whether, and when, he was baptised as a Christian, when he converted to Christianity, and what was involved in the classes to which he went for preparation to be baptised. In short, this submission of the appellant is no more than a claim to obtain merits review.</text>

<tocase>Fuduche v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 45 FCR 515</tocase>
<text>In relation to the medical evidence, the Federal Magistrate observed that: 
 
 "the Tribunal was not disbelieving of the Applicant's medical practitioner. The Tribunal was rather saying that whatever illness the Applicant might have been suffering from had not been observed by it to prevent the Applicant giving his evidence" , 
 

 
and said that this was not an error such as was found in Fuduche v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 45 FCR 515. Furthermore, the Federal Magistrate noted that the selection and assessment of independent country information was a matter for the Tribunal.

The Federal Magistrate rejected the submission that the Tribunal had required independent corroboration regarding the appellant's claims about his conversion to Christianity and his asserted dissipation of funds after the purported withdrawal of financial support by the Islamic group and was of the opinion that the Tribunal's finding that it was not readily believable that the appellant's financial resources had all disappeared, was unobjectionable and accorded with the facts as they stood. The second aspect of this submission was that the Tribunal had deprived itself of jurisdiction by imposing a requirement on the appellant that he be formally baptised in order to be at risk of persecution as an apostate from Islam. The Federal Magistrate observed that: 
 
 "...the Tribunal did not at any stage in its reasons for decision assert that it was necessary for the Applicant to have provided independent evidence of his conversion to Christianity or that baptism was necessary for persecution to occur."

As to the claim of bias, the Federal Magistrate read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the hearing. The Federal Magistrate said that the transcript did not show on its face either unfairness to the appellant or a predisposition amounting to a mind not open to argument and that the audio recording did not show any overt hostility on the part of the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the Tribunal member was listening attentively to the appellant and that the appellant's answers were coherent, to the point and showed no undue signs of stress with the exception of the last paragraph of his evidence which did suggest "a certain weariness and distress" on the part of the appellant. The Federal Magistrate found that the transcript and the audio recording did not reveal any improper conduct and that even if he accepted that the Tribunal member had turned her back on the appellant (and he made no such finding) that conduct was at worst an unfortunate discourtesy but did not give rise to a finding of bias.</text>

<tocase>SZCSC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 418</tocase>
<text>I reject the submission that the matters identified by the Full Court in that extract applied to the Tribunal's reasoning in the present case. The Tribunal explained why it had not found the appellant's evidence credible and why he was an unsatisfactory witness. It may be that other tribunals or courts may have approached the issue of the credibility of the appellant's evidence on a different basis and considered different aspects of the appellant's evidence in forming a view on the appellant's credibility but it was not for the Federal Magistrate, nor is it for this Court to undertake that task. As Mansfield J said in SZCSC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 418 at par [55]: 
 
 "It is not the role of the Court to form a view as to whether it would have reached a different factual conclusion on the evidentiary material."</text>

<tocase>Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 113 FCR 396</tocase>
<text>It is also clear from the Tribunal's decision that it had before it, and had taken into account, the Special Rapporteur's Report which had been referred to by the appellant's representative in her submission to the Department on 23 July 2007. The appellant accepted that the Tribunal did not have to make separate findings on each piece of evidence which was placed before it but he submitted that although it was open to the Tribunal to prefer the United States State Department Report on Religious Freedom over the Special Rapporteur's Report, the Tribunal should have set out why it preferred that report over the Special Rapporteur's Report. It was not a jurisdictional error or, indeed any error, for the Tribunal not to give this explanation: see, eg, Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 423; Rezaei v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1294 ; Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 268 at par [29]; SZALW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1690 at pars [18], [19] and [29].</text>

<tocase>SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198</tocase>
<text>The appellant submitted that there was no evidentiary basis upon which the Tribunal could have decided that the appellant was not a genuine convert for the reasons that the Tribunal set out in its findings. The appellant submitted that in such circumstances jurisdictional error was established. In support of this submission the appellant relied on SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198. In that case the Court quashed the Tribunal's decision on the basis that the Tribunal's determination was based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact which led the Court to the conclusion that the determination of the Tribunal was "an unreasoned decision". The Court said at par [26]: 
 
 "Here, the inconsistencies (or rather, omissions) in the first appellant's evidence adverted to by the Tribunal are at most minor or trivial. Further, the Tribunal's reasons disclose no legitimate articulable basis for the finding, based on those omissions, that the first appellant fabricated fundamental aspects of his refugee claims. ..."

Those observations are not apposite to the Tribunal's reasoning in this case. The Tribunal formed an adverse view of the credibility of the appellant and it explained by reference to a number of particulars why it had reached that conclusion. The matters to which the Tribunal referred were not, in my view, minor or trivial. True it is that they did not bear directly upon any aspect of the appellant's conversion to, or belief in, Christianity. Nevertheless, they did provide a rational basis upon which it was open for the Tribunal to form a view as to the general credibility of the appellant's evidence.

The respondent submitted that there was no proper basis for the appellant's submission that the Federal Magistrate had failed to afford the appellant procedural fairness, given that the Federal Magistrate had listened to the audio tape of the Tribunal hearing and read the transcript prepared by the appellant's representative.

I am satisfied that there is no substance in the appellant's submission that the Federal Magistrate failed to afford the appellant procedural fairness. The Federal Magistrate was given the opportunity by the appellant and his representative to listen to the audio recording of the hearing before the Tribunal and to read a written transcript of that hearing in addition to their affidavit evidence as to the conduct of the hearing. The Federal Magistrate found that the transcript and the audio recording did not reveal any improper conduct on the part of the Tribunal and concluded that there would be few passages which could properly be described as a few minutes, as described by the appellant's representative, during which the Tribunal member would have had time to turn her back and not take notes in the manner described by the representative. That finding and conclusion was certainly open to the Federal Magistrate on the material before him.

During the course of submissions, I was provided with the audio recording of the Tribunal hearing to which I listened, and the written transcript of the hearing which I read. On the basis of what I heard and read I am satisfied that the Federal Magistrate did not err in his reasoning, findings and conclusion referred to in pars [16] and [17] above.</text>
