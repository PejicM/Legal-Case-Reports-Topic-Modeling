<tocase>Creevy &amp; Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456</tocase>
<text>22 In this particular case, there is no persuasive conduct on the part of the officers of the company which would suggest that there has been insolvent trading although, of course, there simply is no evidence of any of these conduct questions because the voluntary administrators have not had sufficient time to examine the various matters. Although the observations in the authorities to which I have been referred, including Creevy &amp; Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456 ; First Netcom Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 35 ACSR 615 ; and Lemery Holdings Pty Ltd v Reliance Financial Services BC200804142 , emphasise the importance of probative and persuasive evidence that the interests of creditors will be served by enabling the company to continue in voluntary administration, it seems to me that the circumstance that the voluntary administrators have been in office for merely a day (notwithstanding inferences which might arise from the appointment of administrators the day before the return date for the hearing) emphasises that the question to be addressed is whether, in the limited time available to the voluntary administrators to forensically examine the affairs of the company, the interests of the company's creditors are better served by enabling the company to continue in voluntary administration during the period of the adjournment, so that all relevant matters identified by the administrators might be examined. It seems to me that it is in the interests of creditors to enable some forensic assessment to be made by professional voluntary administrators, of facts and circumstances which might demonstrate that the entity can continue to trade as a going concern and is capable of being sold.</text>
