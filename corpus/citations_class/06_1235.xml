<tocase>Ireland v The Queen (unreported CCA Sup Ct of A, Library Number 9401656, 6 May 1994)</tocase>
<text>Norilya applied to the trial judge for restitution orders under s 717 of The Criminal Code (WA). Those orders were made on 20 August 1993. They took the form of orders directing the transfer of moneys and assets to Norilya from accounts and companies apparently controlled by the prospectors. The prospectors each lodged an appeal against their convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Enforcement of the restitution orders was stayed. However the appeals were dismissed on 6 May 1994 Ireland v The Queen (unreported CCA Sup Ct of WA Library Number 9401656, 6 May 1994). The restitution orders made were thereafter enforced. Norilya recovered $5,782,556.94 upon the execution of the orders.

Norilya commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on 14 August 1990 against the prospectors. In their defence to the civil action filed 3 December 1990, the prospectors denied that the samples submitted for assay from the phase 2 and phase 3 drillings contained gold which had been added to those samples. In August 1993 Norilya applied for summary judgment in the civil action in reliance on the convictions of the prospectors. Summary judgment, for damages to be assessed, was granted against each of the prospectors in August 1994. The calculation of the damages in that case would, of course, have had to take account of sums received under the restitution orders.</text>

<tocase>Easterday v R (2003) 143 A Crim R 154</tocase>
<text>In 1998 the prospectors lodged a petition for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. The petition was referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Attorney-General pursuant to s 140(1) of the Sentencing Act 1995 (WA). Such a petition is to be heard and determined under the section as if it were an appeal against the convictions. Upon the hearing of the petition the Court quashed the convictions of each of the applicants on 28 March 2003 Easterday v R (2003) 143 A Crim R 154. The result turned upon non-disclosure by the Crown of a document relating to share trading patterns in the market at the relevant time which might have pointed to other persons as responsible for the alleged salting of the assay samples.

The failure by the Crown to disclose the report to the defence in a timely fashion was found by Scott J to have put the prospectors in the position where a relevant line of investigation could not be pursued. He was of the view that the Crown's case was a very strong circumstantial evidence case but that notwithstanding that the appeal should be allowed.

Steytler J observed (at [233]): 
 
 the hearing of the appeal before us, the appellants sought to mount a case which was rather different to that advanced by them at trial. They acknowledged that salting had occurred. They conceded that the evidence was overwhelming in that respect. However, they advanced the proposition that it was not them who had salted the tenements and that the fresh or new evidence now available demonstrates that others had both the motive and opportunity to do so. They contend that the absence of this fresh or new evidence at the trial and at their previous appeal deprived them of a real chance of acquittal which would otherwise have existed.'</text>

<tocase>Easterday v State of Western Australia (2005) 30 WAR 122</tocase>
<text>The Court of Criminal Appeal, in a judgment published on 10 June 2005, declared the restitution orders to be null and void. It also held that it had a discretionary power to order the repayment of moneys paid pursuant to a restitution order. The Court gave the parties the opportunity to make submissions as to further orders that should be made Easterday v State of Western Australia (2005) 30 WAR 122.</text>

<tocase>Easterday v State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 202</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASCA/2005/202.html</AustLII>
<text>On 28 October 2005, following submissions, the Court said it would further order that Norilya repay to each of the prospectors the amount received by it from that prospector pursuant to the making of the restitution orders. An application for a stay by Norilya was dismissed. Steytler J said: 
 
 seems to me that in this case, too, the effect of a stay would be that the applicants would not be restored to all that was lost by them as a consequence of the erroneous judgment ... Instead, Norilya would be allowed to benefit from the judgment by retaining money which it would not otherwise have held and to which it has yet to establish any entitlement ... The position would, in reality, be no different than if the Court had declined to make orders for restitution pending the outcome of the civil action. That being so, and given the potential prejudice which that course might work upon the applicants (as a consequence, at least, of what would then be their inability to resort to any funds, which might otherwise have been repaid by Norilya, for the purpose of funding their defence of the civil action), and given also that no other basis has been put forward to support the imposition of a stay, it seems to me that it would be inappropriate to order a stay and I would decline to do so.' 
 
 v State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 202 (at [16]) 
 

The formal order of the Court of Criminal Appeal required Norilya to repay to Mr Ireland the sum of $1,898,703.33. The judgment for damages which had been entered against each of the prospectors in the civil action in the Supreme Court was set aside by consent on 7 December 2005.

Mr Dean Ireland had lodged a debtors petition on 13 March 1995 pursuant to s 55 of the Bankruptcy Act . He became bankrupt on that date. Norilya lodged a proof of debt in the bankrupt estate for the amount of $980,945. This was for the difference between loss and damage suffered by Norilya and the total amount recovered by it from the prospectors under the restitution orders. On 12 April 1996 Norilya received a distribution of $42,430.75 in the bankrupt estate. Mr Ireland was discharged from bankruptcy with effect from 14 March 1998.

The civil action in the Supreme Court of Western Australia was commenced between Norilya (then Noranda) and the prospectors on 14 August 1990 by writ of summons. The indorsement on the writ stated that: 
 
 Plaintiff's claim is for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, alternatively damages for misleading or deceptive conduct pursuant to sections 10 and 77 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 arising out of representations made by the defendants in or about May, June or July 1990 concerning certain mining tenements near Mt Gibson.'</text>

<tocase>Daemar v Industrial Commission of NSW (No 2) (1990) 22 NSWLR 178</tocase>
<text>Discharge of a bankrupt does not spell the end of the trustee's duties to distribute to creditors such property as remains vested in the trustee. Property, including choses in action, which has vested in a trustee by reason of bankruptcy continues to be so vested after the discharge of the bankrupt. The release provision, s 153(1) , does not revest in the bankrupt property previously vested in the trustee Daemar v Industrial Commission of NSW (No 2) (1990) 22 NSWLR 178. In that case the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that a right of action which the former bankrupt had to challenge certain orders of the Industrial Commission, remains vested in his trustee. It would seem to be implicit in the continuing responsibility of the trustee for the distribution of the former bankrupt's estate to creditors, in respect of provable debts, that the leave requirement under s 58(3) remains in place to the extent that there is a dispute about the existence of such a debt. Such leave could authorise a resolution of that dispute in separate proceedings. The leave requirement is not expressly limited in time. Section 58(3) refers to the period '... after a debtor has become bankrupt'. It may be noted that the definition of 'bankrupt' in s 5 of the Act means a person: 
 
 who has become a bankrupt by virtue of the presentation of a debtors petition;' 
 

Provisions of the Act relating to 'a bankrupt' are not therefore temporally limited by that term Official Receiver v Todd (1986) 14 FCR 177 in which it was held that liability to examination under s 81(1) of the Bankruptcy Act does not expire upon discharge. It would seem that in all but the most unusual cases, of which this is one, questions of the kind raised here would not arise in any practical sense.</text>

<tocase>Spain v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Limited [1923] HCA 21 ; (1923) 32 CLR 138</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1923/21.html</AustLII>
<text>Norilya is concerned that the discharge of Mr Ireland from bankruptcy does not excuse it from the requirement to seek leave to prosecute its claim for fraud in the civil action. It is concerned, moreover, that the claim for fraud may arguably be a claim for liquidated damages comprising the purchase price paid by it to Mr Ireland at the direction of Acarus to acquire a 30% interest in the tenements. So the damages claim, albeit based in fraud, may give rise to a 'provable debt' within the meaning of s 82. To the extent that the claim seeks recovery of moneys paid by way of the purchase price for the tenements, it is arguably a claim for liquidated damages. As was said in Spain v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Limited [1923] HCA 21 ; (1923) 32 CLR 138 (at 142 per Knox CJ and Starke J): 
 
 is well said by Mr Odgers (Pleading and Practice, 5 th ed, p 41), "whenever the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled ... can be ascertained by calculation or fixed by any scale of charges, or other positive data, it is ... liquidated".' 
 

On the other hand, in Cornelius v Barewa Oil and Mining NL (In liq) (1982) 42 ALR 83 Burt CJ observed that (at 84): 
 
 
 
 
 claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation remains a claim or demand for unliquidated damages even if the relief as claimed is for a liquidated amount.'</text>

<tocase>Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Limited [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/67.html</AustLII>
<text>Norilya contends that by reason of the High Court's decision in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Limited [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202, an action for unliquidated damages for misleading and deceptive conduct does not give rise to a provable debt. This is of course subject to the qualification that the claim arises 'other than by reason of a contract, promise or breach of trust'. In Coventry the High Court was concerned with an action for misleading or deceptive conduct under s 995(2) and s 1005 of the Corporations Law (Qld). The Court held by majority that a statutory claim for unliquidated damages for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the claimant to make a contract with some party other than the bankrupt but not with the bankrupt is not a provable debt for the purposes of s 82. In the joint judgment of Gleeson, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ (at [6]) their Honours said: 
 
 reasons demonstrate that a statutory claim for unliquidated damages for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the claimant to make a contract not with the bankrupt but with a third party is not a debt provable in bankruptcy. It is a demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract or promise. The bankrupt is not discharged from liability. The claim may be pursued by the claimant during the bankruptcy and after discharge from bankruptcy. By contrast, a claim for unliquidated damages for misleading or deceptive conduct by the bankrupt, which induced the claimant to make a contact with the bankrupt, would be a debt provable in bankruptcy.'

In this case it is not alleged that Norilya entered into any contract with the prospectors by reason of the misrepresentations alleged. Its contract was with Acarus, albeit its payments were made to the prospectors. It does not rely upon the Deed of Assumption in that respect.</text>

<tocase>Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta (2005) 216 ALR 670</tocase>
<text>In this case leave is appropriate. The matter is plainly one of some complexity and the justice of the case requires that Norilya has the opportunity to pursue what may be in effect, a set-off against the obligation which it has to repay the restitution moneys under the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta (2005) 216 ALR 670 at [20] [21] (Conti J).

I am not disposed to attach any such condition to the grant of leave, which in this case will only be necessary in relation to the fraud claim. The question whether any stay of proceedings should be sought in the light of the unsatisfied orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal is a matter for the Supreme Court. The justice of such a condition is not immediately apparent.

For the preceding reasons I propose to grant leave to Norilya to continue with the proceeding issued against the respondent and others in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. In my opinion the costs of this proceeding should be costs in the Supreme Court proceeding, but I will hear from the parties as to that. 


 I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
