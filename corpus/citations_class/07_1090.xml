<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/53.html</AustLII>
<text>47 The appellant refers to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57, especially Gaudron J at [106] wherein her Honour said:
 
 Although relief by way of prohibition under s 75(v) of the Constitution is discretionary, the guiding principle is that "[t]hose exercising executive and administrative powers are as much subject to the law as those who are or may be affected by the exercise of those powers". 

Reliance is also placed by the appellant upon authorities which relate to delay see: SZHRF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 766 at [35] and the observations of McHugh J in Re Commonwealth; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491 at 495 and of Stone J in Applicant S1338 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 53.</text>

<tocase>Makhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 221</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/221.html</AustLII>
<text>20 His Honour also noted that the original Application for Review was made before s 441G of the Act became operational and that the nomination of the migration agent in the application for review could not have been made in the context of an 'authorised recipient' as provided by s 441G of the Act. However, the parties proceeded on the basis that when s 411G did become operational, it rendered the appellant's migration agent the authorised recipient for the purpose of the section. His Honour followed the decision of Mansfield J in Makhu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 221 to deem that the appellant had received the invitation, notwithstanding that under s 441G of the Act the invitation ' must ' be sent to the appellant's authorised recipient.

21 Although finding that the Tribunal acted correctly in respect of service of the notice, Nicholls FM found that the Tribunal did not comply with the relevant statutory requirements in respect of the period of notice. His Honour found that there was jurisdictional error in the procedures of the Tribunal. His Honour noted that s 425A(3) in conjunction with Regulation 4.35D(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations') stipulated that the prescribed period for giving notice of an invitation to a hearing starts when the appellant receives notice of the invitation and ends at the expiration of 14 days after the day on which notice is received. His Honour also noted that s 441A(4) of the Act provided a method by which the Tribunal gives a document to a person is to date the document and dispatch it by prepaid post within 3 working days to the last address for service, or last residential or business address provided by the appellant. His Honour also noted that section 441C(4)(a) of the Act relevantly provides that a person is taken to have received a document from the Tribunal 7 working days after the date of the document.

22 In applying the legislation to the facts his Honour found that the date of the invitation to the hearing was 31 January 2002 and that the invitation was sent by prepaid post to the migration agent and the appellant at his residential address on 1 February 2002, thus within the requisite 3 working days. His Honour found that the migration agent would be deemed to have received the letter of invitation on Monday 11 February 2002. Pursuant to Regulation 4.35D(b) the period of notice required in relation to an invitation to attend a hearing in the case would have ended 14 days later on Monday 25 February 2002. The hearing was set for 22 February 2002 and thus the period of notice was deficient by 3 days. His Honour accordingly found that the Tribunal did not satisfy the requirements of the prescribed period of notice both for the letter sent to the migration agent and the letter sent to the appellant pursuant to s 425A(3) of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>41 The appellant claims that, since s 422B was not in force at the time there had been common law unfairness by the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal satisfied the statutory requirements in respect of the issue and service of the invitation under s 425A of the Act. Further, receipt is deemed to have been effected by the provisions of s 441C. Since the statutory procedure was adopted, there is no basis for a finding of a denial of procedural fairness: see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 373.

42 As stated previously, Nicholls FM observed that no evidence had been led by the appellant to show that the appellant's advisor had not received a copy of the invitation. There is however evidence that the Tribunal contacted the adviser by telephone and was informed that the appellant was unlikely to attend but that efforts would be made to contact him. Nothing further was heard and no application was made to the Tribunal to adjourn the hearing. It follows that this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

43 Although Nicholls FM found that there had been a breach of the statutory requirements concerning the provision of notice in the s 425A invitation, he declined to remit the matter to the Tribunal in the exercise of his discretion. His discretion was so exercised after a detailed investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the appellant's application.</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Nicholls FM, referring to the High Court's decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 observed that the grant of relief of the nature sought by the appellant (writs under s 75(v) of the Constitution ) is discretionary and may be refused if the conduct of a party is inconsistent with the grant of such relief for reasons of, inter alia, unwarrantable delay, acquiescence or waiver or unclean hands on the part of the party seeking relief.

26 Nicholls FM was satisfied that the appellant would have known of the Tribunal's decision to affirm the Minister's refusal of his application for a protection visa by mid November 2004. Nicholls FM found that since the appellant's application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court was not made until May 2005, there was an unwarrantable delay by the appellant in pursuing his appeal. Nicholls FM considered that the appellant's conduct in pursuing the s 48B Application rather than seeking review of the Tribunal's decision of 27 February 2002 showed that the appellant lacked the sense of grievance or urgency that the appellant had subsequently asserted. Nicholls FM was also of the view that the appellant demonstrated 'unclean hands' due to inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence and submissions. Accordingly his Honour refused to exercise his discretion to grant the relief sought by the appellant and dismissed the application.

27 By Notice of Appeal dated 3 May 2006 the appellant raises the following grounds of review: the Federal Magistrate erred by not finding that the Tribunal failed to accord the appellant procedural fairness in that the Tribunal failed to follow the procedures required by s 425A(1) and s 441G(1) of the Act; the Federal Magistrate erred in not remitting the matter to the Tribunal even though a breach of procedural fairness existed; and the Tribunal failed to accord the appellant procedural fairness in its failure to give the appellant an opportunity to comment upon the country information reports which were taken into account by the Tribunal.

28 The appellant submits that since s 441A of the Act had commenced operation by the time the invitation to the Tribunal's hearing was sent, it was necessary for the Tribunal to send the letter to the 'authorised recipient' as required by s 441G. The Tribunal failed to do so and accordingly service of the invitation was defective.

29 It is essential to consider the legislative regime which applied at the time of the appellant's original Application for Review. The original Application for Review was received by the Tribunal on 10 November 2000 under cover of a facsimile sheet provided by the appellant's adviser, Kamlesh Singh. The address on the fax coversheet was nominated as 16 Blue Hills Avenue, Mount Waverley, Victoria.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<text>48 The Court has considered the statements of principle referred to in the above decisions but does not consider that they address the issue which Nicholls FM had before him. The appellant had chosen deliberately to pursue alternate means of obtaining a visa rather than to challenge the decision which had been made by the Tribunal. Nicholls FM exercised his discretion in determining whether to grant the relief sought by the appellant for the established breach: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [28] and [49]-[59]. His Honour was entitled to find, on the evidence before him, that the appellant had engaged in conduct inconsistent with his recently stated grievance, had acquiesced in the Tribunal's decision and came to the Court with 'unclean hands'.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2004/972.html</AustLII>
<text>23 As the proceedings were commenced prior to the enactment of s 422B of the Act, Nicholls FM also had regard to the question whether the requirements of common law procedural fairness were met by the Tribunal in relation to the hearing invitation. His Honour had regard to the decisions of Smith FM in SZDOG v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 972 and SZEMB v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 448. In these decisions the discretion of the Tribunal to proceed to determination of the application under s 426A(1) of the Act was vitiated because the Tribunal failed to address considerations relevant to the exercise of that discretion. However his Honour distinguished such decisions on their facts. In SZDOG , the Tribunal had drawn a mistaken positive conclusion that the appellant had shown a deliberate lack of interest in his application. In SZEMB the Tribunal proceeded to make a final decision on the mistaken belief that the agent had been notified with sufficient time for him to make significant efforts to contact his client. No such considerations applied in the present circumstances.</text>
