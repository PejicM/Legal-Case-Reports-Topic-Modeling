<text>7 The Respondents submitted that it was relevant also to take into account, as part of the background to their application, litigation that Mr Rogers' wife, Lynne Maree Rogers ("Mrs Rogers") had come to institute in the Court. Having regard to the events and proceedings listed in the chronology below and to an observation made by Spender J in one of those proceedings that: "It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these proceedings in the name of Lynne Maree Rogers have been instituted, and then resurrected, because earlier proceedings brought by the applicant's husband were the subject of orders of dismissal in the light of the bankruptcy of Gregory Rogers and the decision by his trustee in bankruptcy not to pursue those proceedings" ; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 at [9] , I agree.

16 Further detail concerning relevant events is given in the following chronology:
 CHRONOLOGY 
 Date Event 2003/2004 Mr Rogers and Livingspace Holdings, borrowed monies from ALCPL. The monies were secured by, amongst other things, guarantees from Mr Rogers, Mrs Rogers and Ms Braas. 13.07.04 ALCPL, by its solicitors, issued a Letter of Demand to Mr Rogers demanding repayment of his indebtedness to it under his guarantee. 20.07.04 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD136/2004 against the present First to Sixth Respondents. The parties appeared before Justice Spender on 28 July 2004, and the proceedings were adjourned to 10 August 2004. 04.08.04 Proceeding QUD136/2004 settled pursuant to the terms of a Deed of Settlement ("First Deed") executed by the parties, including the Applicant and Ms Brass. Proceeding QUD136/2004 was discontinued by Mr Rogers as provided for under the First Deed. 08.11.04 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD224/2004 against the present First to Sixth Respondents, seeking substantially the same relief claimed by him in QUD136/2004. 08.12.04 Proceeding QUD224/2004 heard by Justice Spender, who declined to make interim orders in terms of those sought by Mr Rogers. His Honour made directions for the future conduct of the proceeding and set it down for hearing for 4 days commencing 23 May 2005. 20.12.04 Mr Rogers commences proceeding QUD275/2004 by way of an appeal against Justice Spender's decision on 8 December 2004 to refuse to grant the interlocutory relief sought in QUD224/2004. 23.02.05 Mr Rogers declared bankrupt on the petition of Dale &amp; Myers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd. 01.03.05 The solicitors for the Respondents to QUD224/2004 request Mr Rogers' trustee in bankruptcy to make an election pursuant to s 60 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (" Bankruptcy Act "). 08.09.05 Mrs Rogers consents to judgment against her in favour of ALCPL in proceeding 1600/2005 in the New South Wales Supreme Court. By these proceedings the Second Respondent sought possession a property at 2 Wommin Lake Crescent, Fingal Head. 06.10.05 Matter QUD224/2004 was struck out by Justice Spender on the basis that the action was deemed abandoned pursuant to s 60 Bankruptcy Act 1966 . 26.10.05 Matter QUD275/2004 was struck out by Justice Spender on the basis that the appeal was nugatory. 30.11.05 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD525/2005 against the First to Sixth Respondents, relying on virtually identical facts, matters and circumstances alleged by Mr Rogers in QUD136/2004 and QUD224/2004. 05.12.05 Mr Rogers applied to reinstate QUD224/2004. Justice Spender declined to reinstate the proceedings. 07.04.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceedings QUD130/2006, relying on virtually identical facts, matters and circumstances as those previously alleged by Mrs Rogers and him in previous matters in the Federal Court. 20.04.06 Justice Greenwood dismissed the application for interlocutory relief and reserved costs in proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434. 12.10.06 The Respondents in proceeding QUD525/2005 apply for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed.

<text>8 By coincidence, in the ordinary operation of this Court's docket system, it has fallen to me (in QUD375/2007) to decide whether to grant to Mrs Rogers leave to appeal in respect of some of her litigation namely, proceeding QUD173/2007, Rogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd and Ors [2007] FCA 1660 , 1 November 2007, Collier J. There was no objection made to my having each matter. Nonetheless, I have expressly considered whether, in light of that coincidence and the conclusion reached by me in the preceding paragraph, I ought not to hear one of the applications made with respect to Mr and Mrs Rogers' respective proceedings with the other being transferred to another judge to hear and determine. In my opinion, the rules of natural justice do not require that course to be taken.

9 In the substantive application filed in this proceeding Mr Rogers seeks the following relief:
 
(a) orders under s 12GF of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (" ASIC Act ") being damages for "psychological stress, pain and suffering or mental damage" for breaches of the following sections of the ASIC Act :
 
 
 (i) unconscionable conduct s 12CA-CC;
 (ii) undue harassment and coercion s 12DJ;
 (iii) deceptive and misleading conduct s 12DA; 
 

(Mr Rogers relies upon s 12GH of the ASIC Act conduct by directors, employees or agents.)
 
(b) any other orders that the Court deems fit.

10 In my reasons for judgment in relation to Mrs Rogers' leave to appeal application I describe the ultimate origins and chronicle the course of the other litigation which Mr Rogers and later his wife have come to institute or with which they have come to be involved in this and other courts. I have studied the affidavit which Mr Rogers came to swear and file in this proceeding on 1 November 2007 in support of the substantive application. In that affidavit he deposes to a series of alleged "events". Having regard to that affidavit and to the other evidence before me in this proceeding, it is evident that the substantive application and Mrs Rogers' leave to appeal application have like ultimate origins and that the course of the other litigation is likewise relevant. So as to make these reasons for judgment self-contained I have, instead of just incorporating my description and a related chronology by reference from the reasons for judgment in Mrs Rogers' case, again reproduced them in what follows.

Justice Spender reserved his decision. 07.12.06 Justice Collier dismissed the balance of proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1708. 15.12.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD504/2006 by way of an appeal against Justice Collier's decision in QUD130/2006. 23.02.07 Matter QUD504/2006 dismissed by Justice Greenwood: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195. 14.06.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD173/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents, seeking virtually the same relief claimed in proceeding QUD525/2005 (which as at the time remained reserved by Spender J) and relief on the same facts, matters and circumstances. 30.08.07 Justice Spender dismissed proceeding QUD525/2005, with costs. Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371. 01.11.07 Justice Collier dismissed proceeding QUD173/2007, with costs. Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1660. 08.11.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD375/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents in which she seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Justice Collier in QUD173/2007.

32 It is no coincidence that this proceeding, with additional Respondents, including Mr Whittle, who had not hitherto featured in Mr Rogers' litigation, came to be instituted after de Jersey CJ made his orders and on the same day that Collier J dismissed an application brought on 14 June 2007 by Mrs Rogers against those who are the present First to Seventh Respondents: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1660 , 1 November 2007. I note that, in those proceedings (at [38] &amp; [39]), Collier J reached a like conclusion in relation to circumvention when ordering the removal from that file of affidavits sworn by Mr and Mrs Rogers respectively. If nothing else, for like reasons, a like fate in these proceedings should be visited on Mr Rogers' affidavit of 1 November 2007 pursuant to O 14 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules .</text>

19 In one of those earlier cases, Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 Greenwood J commented (at [48]):
 It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding, a claim might emerge which, in terms of its material facts, reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss 52 , 51AC or 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee. At the moment the material does not establish any such right. The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee.

20 This comment was made with reference to that class of property which s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act removes from property divisible amongst a bankrupt's creditors, namely:
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not extend to the following property:
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (g) any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation: 
 
 
(i) for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt; or (ii) in respect of the death of the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt; 
 
 and any damages or compensation recovered by the bankrupt (whether before or after he or she became a bankrupt) in respect of such an injury or wrong or the death of such a person.

21 In another of those earlier cases, Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , which again came before Greenwood J, his Honour commented (at [44]):
 Moreover, if the services relied upon by Mr Rogers for the purposes of s 60 of the TPA are financial services as the pleading seems to suggest, s 51AF(1) provides that Part V of the Act within which s 60 falls 'does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services'. The relevant statutory instrument regulating financial services is the [ASIC Act].

22 These comments seem to have inspired Mr Rogers to give his perceived grievances different attire in the form of the present proceedings in the hope that they will prove less threadbare in law than has hitherto proved to be the case. Regard to Mr Rogers' affidavit of 1 November 2007 discloses that, in the main, those perceived grievances replicate those set out in statements of claim that he filed in earlier proceedings in this Court. An exception to this is a personal injuries damages claim based on alleged breaches of the ASIC Act .

23 Insofar as those perceived grievances are now presented in a different guise:
 
(a) any cause of action under the ASIC Act that does not fall within s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act is vested in Mr Rogers' trustee in bankruptcy; and
 
(b) having regard to Mr Rogers' affidavit of 1 November 2007 and the other evidence upon which he relies, the following further observations made by Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 remain apposite, even though the claim is now formulated by reference to the ASIC Act rather than the Trade Practices Act :
 
 (i) (at [45]) "In truth, Mr Rogers seeks to recover the lost value of the rights and entitlements he says he ought to have enjoyed by reason of the fulfilment of the promises of the relevant respondents in respect of each of the various property transactions pleaded in the statement of claim. Any such claim is vested in the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers."; 
 
(ii) (at [55]) "Damages for anxiety or stress may, however, be consequential but severable in the sense of being capable of estimation without regard in the estimation , to the bankrupt's rights of property. The claim by Major Wilson [in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102] considered by Dixon J [in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2);(1935) [1935] HCA 48 ; 52 CLR 713 at 721] was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt. If the damages are capable of estimation in such a way and are capable of being understood as severable from any claim on behalf of the trustee, it seems to me that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [(1997) 75 FCR 545] applying Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) contemplates that such a claim resides with the bankrupt even though it may be properly described as a consequential claim." (Emphasis in original; explanatory case references or citations added).

35 The reference to "the principle stated by Dixon J" is a reference to the reasons for judgment of his Honour in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721 to which reference is made in the passage which I have quoted above from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195.

39 In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 , Greenwood J did no more than acknowledge a theoretical possibility, recognised in the authorities to which his Honour referred, of a severable personal injuries claim. As it transpires, Mr Rogers' endeavour to engage that theoretical possibility in practice is, at least as presently revealed, futile, in my opinion.

40 The Respondents have sought to have the substantive application dismissed pursuant to the powers conferred on the Court by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (" Federal Court of Australia Act ").</text>

Any such claim is vested in the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers."; 
 
(ii) (at [55]) "Damages for anxiety or stress may, however, be consequential but severable in the sense of being capable of estimation without regard in the estimation , to the bankrupt's rights of property. The claim by Major Wilson [in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102] considered by Dixon J [in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2);(1935) [1935] HCA 48 ; 52 CLR 713 at 721] was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt.

(Emphasis in original; explanatory case references or citations added).

33 For the Respondents it is submitted that none of the damages Mr Rogers claims in the present proceeding would fall for assessment by "immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property". The conjunctive in this proposition, derived from Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721, is emphasised on their behalf. It is submitted that the damages which Mr Rogers claims are entirely consequential on damage to Mr Rogers' financial interests as a result of alleged contraventions of the ASIC Act . Mr Rogers presses for an opposing conclusion.

35 The reference to "the principle stated by Dixon J" is a reference to the reasons for judgment of his Honour in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721 to which reference is made in the passage which I have quoted above from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195.

57 For all that, what in substance Mr Rogers has done in the present proceeding is to seek to agitate a claim for damages for personal injury, loss and damage pursuant to causes of action said to arise under the ASIC Act . He has not done this before. No submission was made that this absence of seeking to litigate this very cause of action was irrelevant in light of Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 and the outcome of earlier proceedings in this Court brought by Mr Rogers against some of the Respondents. Further, it is, with respect, as set out above, possible to discern in the reasons for judgment given in certain of the earlier proceedings the inspiration for the present proceeding. Yet further, the application of the principle described by Sir Owen Dixon in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) in the circumstances of the present case is not without difficulty.</text>

The claim by Major Wilson [in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102] considered by Dixon J [in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2);(1935) [1935] HCA 48 ; 52 CLR 713 at 721] was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt. If the damages are capable of estimation in such a way and are capable of being understood as severable from any claim on behalf of the trustee, it seems to me that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [(1997) 75 FCR 545] applying Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) contemplates that such a claim resides with the bankrupt even though it may be properly described as a consequential claim." (Emphasis in original; explanatory case references or citations added).

34 The answer, in my opinion, is supplied by analogy with the following passage from the judgment of Handley JA, with whom Kirby P (as his Honour then was) and Meagher JA agreed, in the unreported New South Wales Court of Appeal decision Manningel v Hewlett (12 June 1991), which was cited with approval by O'Loughlin and Merkel JJ in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1997) 75 FCR 545 , at 563:
 The plaintiffs claimed damages in the proceedings in the manner particularised in paras 17(e), (f) and (g) of their amended statement of claim but these claims were consequential upon alleged breaches of professional duty owed to them by the defendants in relation to the purchase of the land and the contract by the vendor to erect a dwelling house on it. The plaintiffs' claims for damages for loss of credit, for mental distress, inconvenience and for injury to their physical and mental health therefore were not claims "without reference to their rights of property" within the principle stated by Dixon J. On the contrary those claims were consequential on damages to the plaintiffs' financial and property interests as a result of alleged breaches of professional duty by the solicitors.</text>

<text>44 Like the High Court, this Court has no inherent power to make an order that no legal proceedings should be instituted by a person without the leave of a judge of the court: Commonwealth Trading Bank v Inglis [1974] HCA 17 ; (1974) 131 CLR 311 , at 318. That case acknowledges the existence of an inherent power which would permit a court such as the Federal Court to prevent an abuse of its process by staying or dismissing an existing proceeding. The respondents have no need to call in aid this power as the upholding of their application under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act evidences.</text>

<tocase>Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/907.html</AustLII>
<text>45 A power to make an order that no legal proceedings should be instituted by a person without the leave of a judge of the Court is, however, conferred on the Court by the Federal Court Rules . One such relevant rule is O 21 r 1. In Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 (affirmed on appeal, Skyring v Ramsey [2000] FCA 774) , Sackville J upheld the validity of O 21 r 1 in its then form. His Honour regarded the rule as falling within the rule making power conferred on the court by the Parliament in s 59(1) and s 59(2)(l) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . Order 21 r 1 has since been amended but not in any way which would call into question the continuing relevance of the conclusion reached by Sackville J. Those provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act also support the validity of the other relevant rule, O 21 r 2.

46 So far as presently material and as at the time when the Respondent's application was heard and written submissions made, O 21, r 1 and r 2 provided:
 
 
 1 Vexatious litigant 
 
 (1) If a person institutes a vexatious proceeding and the Court is satisfied that the person has habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted other vexatious proceedings in the Court or any other Australian court (whether against the same person or against different persons), the Court may order: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that any proceeding instituted by the person may not be continued without leave of the Court; and
 (b) that the person may not institute a proceeding without leave of the Court. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) An order under this rule may be made: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) on the Court's own motion; or
 (b) on the application of the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or
 (c) on the application of the Registrar.
 
 
 
 
 
 2 Vexatious proceeding against a person 
 
 Where any person (in this rule called the vexatious litigant) habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground institutes a vexatious proceeding against any person (in this rule called the person aggrieved) in the Court, the Court may, on application by the person aggrieved, order that the vexatious litigant shall not, without leave of the Court, institute any proceeding against the person aggrieved in the Court and that any proceeding instituted by the vexatious litigant against the person aggrieved in the Court before the making of the order shall not be continued by him without leave of the Court.

47 Order 21 r 1(2) has since been amended so as to allow an application under O 21 r 1 to be made by, relevantly, "a person against whom the person mentioned in subrule (1) has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings". This amendment, being procedural, would now give the Respondents a standing which they did not hitherto have to seek relief pursuant to O 21 r 1, providing, of course, that they were persons in respect of whom a vexatious proceeding had been instituted. The standing to bring an application under O 21 r 2, as the then language of that rule provided, was more accommodating for persons in the position in which the respondents allege themselves to be.

51 Discrete applications in the original jurisdiction for relief under O 21 were made in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 , National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) [2005] FCA 1895 (Spender J) (affirmed, Freeman (a bankrupt) v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213) and Granich and Associates v Yap [2004] FCA 1567 (French J).

54 Nonetheless, I note that in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 Finn J entertained, but did not grant, an application made in an existing proceeding for relief under O 21 r 1 and r 2 as a sequel to a summary judgment application. Though the effect, if any, of O 21 r 3 with respect to the practice and procedure in respect of seeking to engage the powers conferred by O 21 r 1 and r 2 is not mentioned in that case, neither it must be said, is it mentioned in Ramsey v Skyring, National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) and Granich and Associates v Yap .

58 In Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 at 380, [44], Finn J observed of O 21 r 1 and r 2:
 
 
 [44] By way of background to the application of these provisions, it is important to have regard to the fundamental principle on which they entrench. This is that every person has a "constitutional right" of access to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain redress in consequence of an alleged breach of his or her rights by some other person: Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau Und Maschinenfabrik v South India Shipping Corp Ltd [1981] AC 909 at 977 ; [1980] 1 All ER 289 at 295; Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 at 389 ; [1999] FCA 907 ; Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213 at 218 19 ; [2006] FCAFC 67. The purpose of the powers given under the Rules is to reinforce the power of the court to protect its own processes against unwarranted usurpation of its time and resources and to avoid the loss caused to those who have to face actions which lack any substance: Jones v Skyring [1992] HCA 39 ; (1992) 109 ALR 303 at 312; [1992] HCA 39 ; 66 ALJR 810 at 814. This said, an order under the Rules will not lightly be made because of its serious impact on the right of access to the courts of this country.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>57 For all that, what in substance Mr Rogers has done in the present proceeding is to seek to agitate a claim for damages for personal injury, loss and damage pursuant to causes of action said to arise under the ASIC Act . He has not done this before. No submission was made that this absence of seeking to litigate this very cause of action was irrelevant in light of Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 and the outcome of earlier proceedings in this Court brought by Mr Rogers against some of the Respondents. Further, it is, with respect, as set out above, possible to discern in the reasons for judgment given in certain of the earlier proceedings the inspiration for the present proceeding. Yet further, the application of the principle described by Sir Owen Dixon in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) in the circumstances of the present case is not without difficulty.</text>
