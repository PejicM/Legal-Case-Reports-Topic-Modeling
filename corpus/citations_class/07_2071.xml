<text>53 Against the legislative background outlined above, the issue is whether the 6 month time limit on exercising the compulsory acquisition power is a condition and restriction "which must be observed" ( Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Allied Trades Union of Australia [1932] HCA 9 ; (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7) or a "condition, limitation or direction" which has the effect of "appointing a course to be followed" ( R v Wallis ; Ex parte Employers Association of Wool-Selling Brokers and H V McKay Massey Harris Pty Ltd [1949] HCA 30 ; (1949) 78 CLR 529 at 550), in each case, to the exclusion of the general power in s 1322(4)(d).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASCA/2006/44.html</AustLII>
<text>31 Mitsui points to further extrinsic material which it submits is also relevant to understanding the policy considerations underpinning Part 6A.2 of the Act . I have set these out below. These were intended to emphasise that, in part, the policy considerations and legislative objective were to remove the potential of minority shareholders from demanding a price for their securities that is above fair value, a practice commonly described as 'greenmailing': Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto [2002] VSC 105 ; (2002) 5 VR 61 at [28] cited with approval by Steytler P in Batoka Pty Ltd v Conocophillips WA-248 Pty Ltd [2006] WASCA 44 at [40] .

56 Hanwha submits that, having regard to the legislative background material and the legislative scheme itself, the intention may be discerned that the 90% holder exercise its compulsory acquisition power, or gift, within the relevant 6 month period or 'lose that right' to echo the words of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. I do not agree. The material to which I have referred does not give paramountcy to the interests of minority shareholders. The legislation is a balancing exercise involving a number of competing considerations. Indeed there is an important national economic perspective discernible particularly in the Explanatory Memorandum. Protection of minority shareholders is but one of a number of objects. For example, one primary object in the legislative scheme identified by Steytler P in Batoka [39] was that shares are acquired at fair value.

57 This intention, Hanwha says, is also manifest in the words "only if" and its location within s 664AA , and that to permit s 1322(4)(d) to override the time limit expressed in such emphatic terms in s 644AA is to deny meaning to the word "only".

58 Hanwha submits that in its context, the word "only" has the role of meaning "not otherwise", rather than that of merely providing a non imperative emphasis to the time limit. There is no basis, it contends, for not giving full force and effect to the meaning of the word "only" in circumstances where a fixed time period is prescribed in emphatic terms in relation to the exercise of a statutory power to expropriate shares.</text>

<tocase>BP Australia Ltd v Brown (2003) 58 NSWLR 332</tocase>
<text>42 Hanwha contends that s 1322(4)(d) is not a relevant source of power for the Court to extend time under s 664AA(b) of the Act . It points to the context of Part 6A.2 Division 1 of the Act , by which a minority shareholder is at risk of having his or her shares compulsorily acquired by a 90% holder. Hanwha submits that the time limit in s 664AA(b) has the effect that, at the end of the period of 6 months, such a person will know whether his or her shares remain at risk of being compulsorily acquired and, if they do, at what price. This, it says, is a perfectly reasonable requirement in a legislative scheme which seeks to balance conflicting commercial interests of this character. It follows, so Hanwha contends, that a 90% holder, who wishes to avail himself of the power to compulsorily acquire, must act within the time period of 6 months set out in s 664AA: cf BP Australia Ltd v Brown (2003) 58 NSWLR 332 per Spigelman CJ in at [115].

52 In concluding that s 1322(4)(d) had to yield to the specific provisions of s 1317HD(2), Byrne J followed not only David Grant but also BP Australia Ltd , which was very similar to Newtronics, involving as it did an attempt to rely upon s 1322(4)(d) in order to extend the statutory time limit prescribed by s 588FF(3) of the Act for liquidators bringing an application to the Court for orders with respect to voidable transactions.

59 However, I do not consider the use of the word "only" to be determinative of the question. I respectfully agree with the observations of Spigelman CJ in BP Australia Ltd. There, the Chief Justice, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, considered the significance of the word "only". He said at [88]: 
 
 The word "only" in a time limitation statutory provision can characterise the provision as a "time so emphatically prescribed". ( Texel Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1994] 2 VR 298 at 300; per Hayne J, in a case under s 459G which was a precursor of David Grant v Westpac ) . However, the use of the word "only" is not of itself determinative. (See eg Emanuele ) . Its force is affected by the relevant statutory scheme considered as a whole, as the analysis in David Grant v Westpac shows.

74 Thirdly, in BP Australia Ltd, the Court regarded the recognition in the Harmer Report (General Insolvency Inquiry (ALRC 45)) of the considerable commercial uncertainty and inconvenience of "general delays associated with the winding up of insolvent companies" as the policy behind the abridgement of the period within which a transaction may be avoided, and which led to the introduction of the phase "may only be made" in s 588FF(3): at 343-344. In Gordon v Tolcher , the High Court cited the Harmer Report to the same effect in relation to "inordinate delays in commencing proceeding in respect of voidable transactions" (at [38]). No such consideration applies with respect to s 664AA.

78 Chapter 6 is not, in my opinion, a self contained and complete code for the resolution of disputes involving the statutory process: cf Emanuele at p 56 per Kirby J; BP Australia Ltd per Spigelman CJ at [79].</text>

79 It is of significance too, in arriving at this conclusion, that wide curative powers are found in s 1325D(1)(a) of the Act which enables the Court to declare, for example, a document not to be invalid merely because a person contravened a provision of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B or 6C. Pt 6A.2 in which s 664AA(b) sits is within Chapter 6A. This was a matter which was also considered to be significant by Mandie J when the offer period under s 650C(1) of the Act and the period for giving notices under s 650D(1)(c)(ii) of the Act were extended pursuant to s 1322(4)(d).

<tocase>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/43.html</AustLII>
<text>43 A particular application of s 1322(4)(d) was considered by the High Court of Australia in David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265. In that case the appellant companies had been served with statutory demands but had failed to comply with the demands within 21 days pursuant to s 459E(2)(c). They each also had failed to apply to the Supreme Court of Victoria in accordance with s 459G for an order setting aside the demands. Section 459G(2) provided that an application for such an order "may only be made within 21 days" after review of the demand. The appellants did serve such applications but outside the statutory 21 day period.

44 Gummow J, with whom the other four members of the Court agreed, predicated his reasons by observing that the "difficulty in construction arises, perhaps not so much from the particular text of either s 459G or s 1322 , as from the interrelation between the two provisions in circumstances where the enactment of s 1322 preceded that of s 459G , and the earlier section is general and the later section specific in its operation."

45 So much may also be said about the present case.

50 Importantly, Byrne J observed that the right to apply to the court in David Grant under s 459G(1) and the time limit in subs(2) were each in terms very similar to those contained in s 1317HD(2) with which his Honour was concerned. [15]

51 Byrne J, too, relied upon the presence of the word "only" as pointing in context, to a "severe application of the time limit".[18] His Honour also placed weight on the "surprising" location of the word "only" which might otherwise have been expected to be located immediately before the phrase "within 6 years after". [15]

52 In concluding that s 1322(4)(d) had to yield to the specific provisions of s 1317HD(2), Byrne J followed not only David Grant but also BP Australia Ltd , which was very similar to Newtronics, involving as it did an attempt to rely upon s 1322(4)(d) in order to extend the statutory time limit prescribed by s 588FF(3) of the Act for liquidators bringing an application to the Court for orders with respect to voidable transactions.

54 To adapt what was said by Gummow J in David Grant (p 277) in relation to the time limits in s 459G(2) and (3) of the Act , the issue is whether an integer or element of the power created by s 664A is its exercise by lodging the compulsory acquisition notice for the acquisition with ASIC within the time specified. Again, to adapt what was said by Isaacs J in The Crown v McNeil [1922] HCA 33 ; (1922) 31 CLR 76 at 100-101, referred to by Gummow J in David Grant at p 277, is it a condition of the gift in s 664A that the time period in s 664AA be observed and, unless this is so, the gift can never take effect?

59 However, I do not consider the use of the word "only" to be determinative of the question. I respectfully agree with the observations of Spigelman CJ in BP Australia Ltd. There, the Chief Justice, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, considered the significance of the word "only". He said at [88]: 
 
 The word "only" in a time limitation statutory provision can characterise the provision as a "time so emphatically prescribed". ( Texel Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1994] 2 VR 298 at 300; per Hayne J, in a case under s 459G which was a precursor of David Grant v Westpac ) . However, the use of the word "only" is not of itself determinative. (See eg Emanuele ) . Its force is affected by the relevant statutory scheme considered as a whole, as the analysis in David Grant v Westpac shows.

63 David Grant and the other cases, involving as they did statutory provisions concerning applications to a Court, may be distinguished from cases such as the present, on the basis that conformity with the procedural time limit was a pre-condition to the jurisdiction of the Court from which relief was claimed: David Grant at 276-277; Emanuele at 152 per Kirby J; Newtronics at [25].

67 I have concluded that s 664AA(b), despite its strong language, does not operate to exclude the operation of s 1322(4)(d). In so finding, I have been mindful that this new provision postdates the commencement of s 1322(4)(a) and the observations in that respect, generally, of the High Court in David Grant at 275-276.

68 However in that case, in addition to the 'jurisdiction' point of difference, it was also of significance to the result that the legislative scheme established by the new Pt 5.4 itself contained specific provisions conferring upon the court an express power to extend time, firstly in relation to the period for compliance with the statutory demand and secondly in relation to the relevant 6 month period. Other aspects within the statutory regime emphasised the importance of s 459G as an integral part of the particular scheme established by Pt 5.4. In particular insurmountable difficulties would have arisen, were an extension of time available under s 1322(4)(d) in relation to the presumption of insolvency under s 459C(2) and the operation of the definition of the 'period for compliance' with the statutory demand set out in s 459F(2): David Grant at pp 277-278. There are no similar difficulties associated with the compulsory acquisition provisions under Pt 6A.2.

69 Section 669, contained in Chapter 6 of the Act , invests ASIC with wide powers to exempt persons from provisions of the Chapter or to declare that the Chapter applies to a person as if specified provisions were omitted, modified or varied. These powers are expressed widely enough to have enabled ASIC in effect to have removed the time limit under s 664AA(b) or to have extended it. They are not however curial remedies.

70 I accept the following further submissions made by Mitsui. First, the issuance of a compulsory acquisition notice depends upon the appointment of an independent expert, from a panel nominated by ASIC, who must prepare a report to be issued simultaneously with the notice. The completion of the report by the independent third party is a necessary predicate to the issuance of the compulsory acquisition notice: s 664C(2)(b)(ii).

79 It is of significance too, in arriving at this conclusion, that wide curative powers are found in s 1325D(1)(a) of the Act which enables the Court to declare, for example, a document not to be invalid merely because a person contravened a provision of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B or 6C. Pt 6A.2 in which s 664AA(b) sits is within Chapter 6A. This was a matter which was also considered to be significant by Mandie J when the offer period under s 650C(1) of the Act and the period for giving notices under s 650D(1)(c)(ii) of the Act were extended pursuant to s 1322(4)(d). In so concluding, David Grant was distinguished: Pinnacle VRB Ltd v Reliable Powerline [2001] VSC 262 at [17] - [20] . A similar approach was taken by Warren J in Capricorn at [260].</text>

<text>59 However, I do not consider the use of the word "only" to be determinative of the question. I respectfully agree with the observations of Spigelman CJ in BP Australia Ltd. There, the Chief Justice, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, considered the significance of the word "only". He said at [88]:

( Texel Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1994] 2 VR 298 at 300; per Hayne J, in a case under s 459G which was a precursor of David Grant v Westpac ) . However, the use of the word "only" is not of itself determinative. (See eg Emanuele ) . Its force is affected by the relevant statutory scheme considered as a whole, as the analysis in David Grant v Westpac shows.

60 In Emanuele v Australian Securities Commission [1997] HCA 20 ; (1996) 188 CLR 114 the High Court gave consideration to s 459P of the then Corporations Law which provided that an application by the Commission for a company to be wound up in insolvency "may only" be made with the leave of the Court.

63 David Grant and the other cases, involving as they did statutory provisions concerning applications to a Court, may be distinguished from cases such as the present, on the basis that conformity with the procedural time limit was a pre-condition to the jurisdiction of the Court from which relief was claimed: David Grant at 276-277; Emanuele at 152 per Kirby J; Newtronics at [25].

65 In Emanuele, Kirby J said at 153: 
 
 'In the morass of modern legislation, it is easy enough, even for skilled and diligent legal practitioners (still more lay persons who must conform to the law) to slip in complying with statutory requirements. The Law is a case in point. Its complexity and detail is such that it has necessitated, within a short time of its enactment, the passage of the First Corporate Law Simplification Act 1995 (Cth). A number of further stages of simplification are promised. An undue rigidity in insisting upon strict compliance with all of the procedural requirements of the Law could become a mask for injustice and a shield for wrong-doing. Against that risk, courts generally retain the facility to cure slips and to repair oversights in proceedings before them, in appropriate cases where justice requires it.'

66 Whether s 664AA(b) is such a procedural requirement lies at the heart of the question.

78 Chapter 6 is not, in my opinion, a self contained and complete code for the resolution of disputes involving the statutory process: cf Emanuele at p 56 per Kirby J; BP Australia Ltd per Spigelman CJ at [79].</text>

<tocase>Gordon v Tolcher (in his capacity as Liquidator of Senafield Pty Ltd (in Liq)) &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 62 ; (2006) 231 ALR 582</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/62.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In Gordon v Tolcher (in his capacity as Liquidator of Senafield Pty Ltd (in liq)) &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 62 ; (2006) 231 ALR 582 at [37] , the High Court saw the relevant distinction, in relation to the time period in s 588FF(3) of the Act , being whether the provision in the section as to time was of the essence of the provision or whether the provision in the section was to be "characterised merely as a time stipulation of a procedural nature".

74 Thirdly, in BP Australia Ltd, the Court regarded the recognition in the Harmer Report (General Insolvency Inquiry (ALRC 45)) of the considerable commercial uncertainty and inconvenience of "general delays associated with the winding up of insolvent companies" as the policy behind the abridgement of the period within which a transaction may be avoided, and which led to the introduction of the phase "may only be made" in s 588FF(3): at 343-344. In Gordon v Tolcher , the High Court cited the Harmer Report to the same effect in relation to "inordinate delays in commencing proceeding in respect of voidable transactions" (at [38]). No such consideration applies with respect to s 664AA.

75 In Gordon v Tolcher , the Court considered the 3 year period within which to bring applications under s 588FF(3) to be immutable by rule of Court, in part because s 588FF(3)(b) specifically provided a judicial power to extend time: at [41]. The existence of a wider regulatory power to modify Chapter 6 is not a reason for discerning an intention to exclude the applicability of the judicial power under s 1322(4)(d). In the context of a complex piece of legislation such as the Act , there is no reason to assume that a role allocated to the regulator should be the foundation for contracting the scope of an otherwise broadly expressed power given to the Court.

76 On the contrary, the whole point of the power under s 669 is to allow a considerable measure of flexibility in the operation of Chapter 6 and such a fundamental legislative intention entirely supports the continued applicability of s 1322(4)(d) under Chapter 6.

77 The decisions, to which I have referred, which have limited the applicability of s 1322(4)(d) in relation to other provisions of the Act concern provisions that have significantly different legislative purposes to relevant provisions of Chapter 6. They do not concern circumstances where the whole of the relevant Part is subject to amendment by ASIC and where the party seeking an extension of time is dependent upon the conduct of others in order to meet the statutory deadlines. They are therefore not decisive of the applicability of s 1322(4)(d) here.</text>

<tocase>Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Co Ltd [2007] FCA 2070</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/2070.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The preliminary issue has been determined, in effect upholding the Cash Sum Objection ( Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Co Ltd [2007] FCA 2070). Mitsui accordingly cannot, without further order of the Court, seek to compulsorily acquire the ordinary shares, as the 6 month period for issuing a notice of compulsory acquisition has ended. The Court now requires to determine Mitsui's application for the Extension of Time Order in this proceeding, to enable it to lodge with ASIC and despatch to Hanwha and Sempurna further compulsory acquisition notices.

20 By consent orders made on 25 October 2007, Mitsui was granted leave to refer to and rely, in this action, on the affidavit of Hirofumi Matsuyama sworn 27 March 2007, the affidavit of Mark Frank Gerus sworn 26 April 2007 and the second affidavit of Hirofumi Matsuyama sworn 9 October 2007, all filed in Federal Court Action No WAD 63 of 2007. In the course of the hearing the third affidavit of Hirofumi Matsuyama sworn 9 November 2007 in the other action was , without objection, also read.

21 Part 6A.2 Division 1 of the Act provides for the compulsory acquisition of minority securities by a 90% holder of securities in the subject entity. The procedure took effect from 13 March 2000.

124 Furthermore, in this case there is no evidence of a blatant disregard by Mitsui of the requirements of the Act : Re Wave Capital Ltd at [29]. Rather, the need for this application is the consequence of the determination of the preliminary issue in the related proceeding, where I found that the Notice did not contain a "cash sum", for which Mitsui, as a 90% holder, proposed to acquire Hanwha's ordinary shares in SAH, as provided in s 664C(2) of the Act : Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Co Ltd [2007] FCA 2070.</text>

<tocase>Newtronics Pty Ltd v Gjergja (2007) 63 ACSR 611</tocase>
<text>48 In Newtronics Pty Ltd v Gjergja (2007) 63 ACSR 611, Byrne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria held that s 1322(4)(d) could not be called in aid to extend the 6 year time limit imposed by the then Corporations Act s 1317HD(2) for the commencement of proceedings under that section.

49 Section 1317HD(2) was in these terms: 
 
 '(2) Proceedings under this section may only be begun within 6 years after the contravention.'

52 In concluding that s 1322(4)(d) had to yield to the specific provisions of s 1317HD(2), Byrne J followed not only David Grant but also BP Australia Ltd , which was very similar to Newtronics, involving as it did an attempt to rely upon s 1322(4)(d) in order to extend the statutory time limit prescribed by s 588FF(3) of the Act for liquidators bringing an application to the Court for orders with respect to voidable transactions.

62 Accordingly, the use of the word "only" is but one ingredient in the constructional spectrum: cf Newtronics at [29].

63 David Grant and the other cases, involving as they did statutory provisions concerning applications to a Court, may be distinguished from cases such as the present, on the basis that conformity with the procedural time limit was a pre-condition to the jurisdiction of the Court from which relief was claimed: David Grant at 276-277; Emanuele at 152 per Kirby J; Newtronics at [25].

82 It is for the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that the justice of the case requires that the extension sought be granted: Newtronics at [40]; cf Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25 ; (1996) 186 CLR 541 at 554.</text>

<text>40 It has been said in a number of cases that s 1322(4) is a remedial provision to be construed liberally: Winpar Holdings Ltd v Goldfields Kalgoorlie Ltd [2001] NSWCA 427 at [74] ; Re Wave Capital Ltd [2003] FCA 969 at [29] .

83 In relation to the discretion afforded to the Court under s 1322 , French J said in Re Wave Capital Ltd at [29] that:
 
 'Each application for the exercise of the court's relieving power will require consideration of all circumstances of the case to ensure that the indulgence sought is appropriate and does not undermine the requirements of the Act . ... the power conferred by s 1322 must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act ... It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions. Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief ...'

84 I will now consider the events which occurred from the time of acquisition by Mitsui of the securities in SAH through to September 2007. These events bear on the question of the exercise of the Court's discretion.

85 On 31 July 2006, Mitsui and Mitsui Australia acquired their aggregate 94.2% interest in the ordinary shares of SAH (and the A class shares of SAH). By operation of s 664AA(b) of the Act , Mitsui had until 31 January 2007 to lodge compulsory acquisition notices with ASIC concerning Hanwha and Sempurna's ordinary (and A class) shares in SAH.

124 Furthermore, in this case there is no evidence of a blatant disregard by Mitsui of the requirements of the Act : Re Wave Capital Ltd at [29]. Rather, the need for this application is the consequence of the determination of the preliminary issue in the related proceeding, where I found that the Notice did not contain a "cash sum", for which Mitsui, as a 90% holder, proposed to acquire Hanwha's ordinary shares in SAH, as provided in s 664C(2) of the Act : Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Co Ltd [2007] FCA 2070.</text>

<text>53 Against the legislative background outlined above, the issue is whether the 6 month time limit on exercising the compulsory acquisition power is a condition and restriction "which must be observed" ( Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Allied Trades Union of Australia [1932] HCA 9 ; (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7) or a "condition, limitation or direction" which has the effect of "appointing a course to be followed" ( R v Wallis ; Ex parte Employers Association of Wool-Selling Brokers and H V McKay Massey Harris Pty Ltd [1949] HCA 30 ; (1949) 78 CLR 529 at 550), in each case, to the exclusion of the general power in s 1322(4)(d).</text>

<tocase>The Crown v McNeil [1922] HCA 33 ; (1922) 31 CLR 76</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1922/33.html</AustLII>
<text>46 Section 1322(4)(d) was found to have no application. The s 459G time limit was held to "define the jurisdiction of the court in respect of an application to set aside a statutory demand" (p 276) and "... attach a limitation or condition upon the authority of the court to set aside the demand" (p 277). The force of the term "may only" was: 
 
 'to define the jurisdiction of the court by imposing a requirement as to time as an essential condition of the new right conferred by s 459G. An integer or element of the right created by s 459G is its exercise by application made within the time specified. To adapt what was said by Isaacs J in The Crown v McNeil [1922] HCA 33 ; (1922) 31 CLR 76 at 100-1, it is a condition of the gift in subs (1) of s 459G that subs (2) be observed and, unless this is so, the gift can never take effect. The same is true of subs 3.'

47 It was also germane to the High Court's decision that the statutory scheme within Pt 5.4 contained its own powers and procedures for the Court to extend time, thereby introducing a degree of flexibility to mitigate hardship or unfairness which otherwise might flow from the strict application of s 459G.

54 To adapt what was said by Gummow J in David Grant (p 277) in relation to the time limits in s 459G(2) and (3) of the Act , the issue is whether an integer or element of the power created by s 664A is its exercise by lodging the compulsory acquisition notice for the acquisition with ASIC within the time specified. Again, to adapt what was said by Isaacs J in The Crown v McNeil [1922] HCA 33 ; (1922) 31 CLR 76 at 100-101, referred to by Gummow J in David Grant at p 277, is it a condition of the gift in s 664A that the time period in s 664AA be observed and, unless this is so, the gift can never take effect?</text>
