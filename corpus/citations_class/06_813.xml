<tocase>Short v FW Hercus Pty Ltd (1993) 40 FCR 511</tocase>
<text>53 The construction of an award, like that of a statute, begins with a consideration of the ordinary meaning of its words. As with the task of statutory construction regard must be paid to the context and purpose of the provision or expression being construed. Context may appear from the text of the instrument taken as a whole, its arrangement and the place in it of the provision under construction. It is not confined to the words of the relevant Act or instrument surrounding the expression to be construed. It may extend to '... the entire document of which it is a part or to other documents with which there is an association'. It may also include '... ideas that gave rise to an expression in a document from which it has been taken' Short v FW Hercus Pty Ltd (1993) 40 FCR 511 at 518 (Burchett J); Australian Municipal, Clerical and Services Union v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1998) 80 IR 345 (Marshall J).</text>

<text>55 As Lindgren J observed in NAQF v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 781 ; (2003) 130 FCR 456, s 15AB assumes that the ordinary meaning of a provision '"taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act" has been identified before any occasion arises for the consideration of extrinsic materials' [70]. Ambiguity or obscurity is not necessary to the application of s 15AB as extrinsic materials may be relied upon to 'confirm' that the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text is the true meaning of the provision [69].</text>

<text>56 The attribution of purpose by reference to context in the wide sense does not await the discovery of an ambiguity in the text. The purpose or object underlying an Act is often determined by consideration of the statutory context CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408 (Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ). Nor does discovery of an ambiguity precede resort to extrinsic material under s 15AB. For as Dawson J said in Mills v Meeking [1990] HCA 6 ; (1990) 169 CLR 214 at 235 (speaking of s 35 of the Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984 (Vic) in almost identical terms to s 15AA): 
 
 'The approach required by s 35 needs no ambiguity or inconsistency; it allows a court to consider the purposes of an Act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction. Reference to the purposes may reveal that the draftsman has inadvertently overlooked something which he would have dealt with had his attention been drawn to it and if it is possible as a matter of construction to repair the defect, then this must be done.'</text>

<tocase>City of Wanneroo v Holmes (1989) 30 IR 362</tocase>
<text>57 It is of course necessary, in the construction of an award, to remember, as a contextual consideration, that it is an award under consideration. Its words must not be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial realities City of Wanneroo v Holmes (1989) 30 IR 362 at 378-379 and cases there cited. There is a long tradition of generous construction over a strictly literal approach where industrial awards are concerned see eg Geo A Bond and Co Ltd (in liq) v McKenzie [1929] AR 499 at 503-4 (Street J). It may be that this means no more than that courts and tribunals will not make too much of infelicitous expression in the drafting of an award nor be astute to discern absurdity or illogicality or apparent inconsistencies. But while fractured and illogical prose may be met by a generous and liberal approach to construction, I repeat what I said in City of Wanneroo v Holmes (at 380): 
 
 'Awards, whether made by consent or otherwise, should make sense according to the basic conventions of the English language. They bind the parties on pain of pecuniary penalties.'

58 The award definition of Community Services Officer (Welfare and ancillary services) makes reference to the 'role', 'aim' and 'concerns' of such Officers. Their role involves the following elements, ie: 
 
 '(i) encourage, promote or conduct community pursuits.' 
 

Their aim is: 
 
 
 '(ii) maintenance or improvement of general social and living standards with regard to family support services, income, welfare, employment, education, health, housing, children's, youth, aged and domiciliary services.' 
 

Their 'primary concern' is expressed in the alternative to the 'aim' and is said to be: 
 
 
 (iii) the social and living standards in the community.' 
 

The definition of Community Services Officer, examined by reference to its language alone, is a kind of verbal Rorschach blot into which almost anything can be read. The first two limbs bring together a role and a stated aim that seem mutually inapposite. The ordinary meaning of the word 'pursuit' in the context in which it appears in the Award is 'the action of following or engaging in something, as a profession, business or recreation' Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. By reference to the words ' community pursuits', a Community Services Officer's role is one which encourages, promotes or conducts business, professional and recreational activities. The word 'community' suggests a limitation by reference to the community served by the local authority which employs the officer. Community pursuits are those which are carried on within the particular community of the municipality. They may encompass activities engaged in by groups and perhaps even individuals within that community. The range of activities covered by the definition is limited in part by the definitions of Community Services Officer (recreation) and Community Services Officer (Arts, Theatre and Museum). They evidence an intention in the Award to carve out of the generality of the term Community Services Officer (Welfare and ancillary services) officers concerned with the encouragement, promotion and conduct of recreational activities and the promotion of artistic, theatrical and museum related activities.

59 The definition of the Community Services Officer's 'aim' begins with words of immense generality which could extend to all levels of government. That is the maintenance or improvement of general social and living standards. The limitation on its generality is itself broadly expressed but again is no doubt to be read within the framework of services provided or supported by the municipality.</text>

<tocase>In the matter of applications to vary the Municipal Officers' (South Australia) Award 1973 (1981) 253 CAR 3</tocase>
<text>61 The class of local authority employees known as 'Community Services Officers' has existed for over 25 years in various contexts. Deputy President Isaac of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said, in 1981: 
 
 'Community service officers are employed by many local councils in a variety of functions and under a variety of titles. The functions embrace recreation, sports and arts activities, care of the aged, child care, youth work, general welfare work and other such activities. Various titles are used in respect of community service officers involved in these activities Community Art Officer, Recreation Officer, Youth Officer, Project Officer, Community Aged Care Officer, Community Development Officer and so on.'

<text>62 In another decision in the same matter relating to hours of duty and definition, Isaac DP was concerned with a proposal to include in the Municipal Officers' (South Australia) Award 1973 a flexible statement of the hours of duty of community service officers. The Local Government Association in that case proposed that, in the area of community service, the ordinary hours of duty would not exceed 38 hours per week to be worked as required by the employing authority except that by mutual agreement such ordinary hours could be worked at any time on any day to a maximum of 76 hours in any two week period or 152 hours in any four week period. Isaac DP observed that the proposal was new and designed to cover community service officers. The submissions put by the Local Government Association, were to the effect that flexibility of hours is a necessary feature of community service work: 
 
 'Rigid application of the standard spread of hours would restrict the provision of community service while the imposition of penalty rates for work outside such hours would place a financial burden on councils, result in a reduction of such service and possible retrenchment of community service officers. There should be a provision under the award, it was submitted, for a council to come to an agreement with the individual employee for the standard 38 hours per week, or some multiple of it for longer periods, to be worked outside the spread of hours on any day of the week without incurring penalty rates.' 
 

Isaac DP did not include the provision proposed by the Local Government Association but observed that the requirement of flexibility and hours of work had been well established by the evidence and he would expect the Municipal Officers Association to allow such flexibility to operate within reasonable bounds to meet the needs of the community In the matter of an application to vary the Municipal Officers' (South Australia) Award 1973 (1981) 255 CAR 431 at 439 and 440. This history supports the welfare centred reading of the term which was adopted by the learned Industrial Magistrate.

63 The City submitted that the purpose of having a separate classification for Community Services Officers was to enable councils to employ them in positions which required working outside normal business hours without the application of penalty provisions such as overtime. The wish to achieve that degree of flexibility could apply to a number of positions other than Community Services Officers. To attach such flexible hours of work provisions to the position of Community Services Officer does not mean that flexible hours of work attaching to a position supports its characterisation as that of Community Services Officer. The question whether an employee is a Community Services Officer depends upon the duties contained in that person's contract of employment and not upon his or her hours of work.

64 It may be accepted that even allowing for the limitations already canvassed the definition of 'Community Services Officer (Welfare and ancillary services)' is of considerable width. For present purposes it is unnecessary to exhaustively define its limits. It is sufficient to determine whether the position of Patrol Officer as described in Mr Van Der Waarden's Contract falls within it.</text>
