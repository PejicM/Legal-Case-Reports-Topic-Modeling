<tocase>Wilhelm v McKay [2005] FCA 792</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/792.html</AustLII>
<text>24 On 22 November 2004, the applicants sought leave to amend the primary application in accordance with a formulation of the decisions and conduct sought to be reviewed, reflected in a document described as Exhibit 'SWS2' to an affidavit of Mr Sharry. The applicants also sought discovery of particular documents. Those applications together with a Notice of Objection to Competency filed on behalf of Ms Jilani were heard by Cooper J on 17 December 2004. Following his Honour's untimely death, the parties agreed that the matters ought to be disposed of on the papers and Finkelstein J determined the various matters and published reasons in support of proposed orders on 15 June 2005 ( Wilhelm v McKay [2005] FCA 792). His Honour, perhaps unfortunately, in deciding the application on the papers did not have the benefit of reflection on the issues afforded by oral argument. On 23 June 2005, the following orders were entered, namely, the applicants be given leave to amend the primary application in terms of the Exhibit 'SWS2' (Order 1); the second respondent (Ms Jilani) make discovery of nominated documents (Order 2); the second respondent's objection to competency is dismissed (Order 3); the second respondent pay 85% of the applicants' costs of the motion (Order 4); and leave be granted to appeal with a stay of the earlier orders pending appeal. The second respondent caused a Notice of Appeal to be filed and on 20 December 2005, the Full Court allowed an appeal and set aside orders 1, 2 and 4 of the orders made by Finkelstein J ( Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 ; (2005 2006) [2005] FCAFC 269 ; 148 FCR 255 per Dowsett, Jacobson and Greenwood JJ).

46 The applicants contend that in formulating the now proposed amendments to the primary Application, the applicants have taken account of the observations of Finkelstein J ( Wilhelm v McKay (supra [24])) and the Full Court ( Jilani v Wilhelm (supra [24])). The Full Court in determining the appeal from the orders and judgment of Finkelstein J reached the following conclusions.

54 At [10] ( Wilhelm v McKay (supra)), Finkelstein J considered the possibility of a challenge to the 'decisions to obtain and issue the warrant' on the ground of bad faith or unfairness and after dealing with the notion that the investigation had come to an end by 7 July 2004 as a matter of inference arising out of the Deed, said this:
 
 
 '10. There is, I suppose, another possibility. It is that the ATO only agreed to give back the documents to achieve a settlement of the actions but it always intended to arrange for the search warrant to avoid handing over the documents. What effect this would have on the terms of settlement is not a matter that will arise on this application. But, if this is what really happened, it may be the basis of a challenge to the decisions to obtain and issue the warrant on the ground of bad faith or unfairness as suggested in In Re Preston [1985] AC 835.

<text>24 On 22 November 2004, the applicants sought leave to amend the primary application in accordance with a formulation of the decisions and conduct sought to be reviewed, reflected in a document described as Exhibit 'SWS2' to an affidavit of Mr Sharry. The applicants also sought discovery of particular documents.

Following his Honour's untimely death, the parties agreed that the matters ought to be disposed of on the papers and Finkelstein J determined the various matters and published reasons in support of proposed orders on 15 June 2005 ( Wilhelm v McKay [2005] FCA 792). His Honour, perhaps unfortunately, in deciding the application on the papers did not have the benefit of reflection on the issues afforded by oral argument. On 23 June 2005, the following orders were entered, namely, the applicants be given leave to amend the primary application in terms of the Exhibit 'SWS2' (Order 1); the second respondent (Ms Jilani) make discovery of nominated documents (Order 2); the second respondent's objection to competency is dismissed (Order 3); the second respondent pay 85% of the applicants' costs of the motion (Order 4); and leave be granted to appeal with a stay of the earlier orders pending appeal.

46 The applicants contend that in formulating the now proposed amendments to the primary Application, the applicants have taken account of the observations of Finkelstein J ( Wilhelm v McKay (supra [24])) and the Full Court ( Jilani v Wilhelm (supra [24])). The Full Court in determining the appeal from the orders and judgment of Finkelstein J reached the following conclusions.

47 In dealing with the contention reflected in the proposed Ground 1(b) that the person who swore the information was not authorised to do so pursuant to s 3E of the Crimes Act , the Full Court observed that the essence of the applicants' contention was that that person was not authorised because the information was not sworn by a member of the AFP and secondly, the ATO's investigation of the tax affairs of Wilhelm, Dempsey, Markit and Urinda was over and thus no authority or power subsisted to call in aid the AFP to issue a warrant. The Full Court concluded that s 3E of the Crimes Act does not confine applications to individuals who are members of the AFP ( Jilani v Wilhelm at 269 [72]; Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2000) 111 FCR 175 at [128] , per Hely J. As to the contention that the ATO's authority to swear an information in support of a search warrant was exhausted by execution and operation of the Deed of Settlement, the Full Court observed that Finkelstein J was willing to draw such an inference from the applicants' entitlement to collect the documents in accordance with clause 2(c) of the deed. The Full Court concluded, however, that nothing in the Deed of Settlement could give rise to an inference that the ATO investigation had come to an end. Moreover, even if the investigation had come to an end, nothing could be inferred from the terms of the Deed of Settlement that it was not open to the Commissioner to resume or continue the investigation made to that point. Nothing in the Deed of Settlement was capable of supporting an allegation that the investigation had been irrevocably terminated ( Jilani v Wilhelm at 269 [75]).

49 In dealing with the contention reflected in the proposed Ground 2(aa) of improper purpose, the applicants contended that the person who swore the information and requested the issue of the warrant did so for an improper purpose, that is, a purpose other than the investigation of the relevant offences. Senior Counsel for the applicants, Mr Hack SC, frankly conceded before the Full Court that he was not in a position to state the contended improper purpose. The applicants asserted that a statutory purpose for the use of the power is identifiable and it was arguable that the power was not used for the statutory purpose. Nevertheless, Mr Hack SC conceded firstly that he could not state the purpose and secondly, the logic underlying the unparticularised allegation of improper purpose was an inference said to flow from the Deed of Settlement that the ATO did not intend to further investigate the alleged commission of criminal offences ( Jilani v Wilhelm at 270 [80]). At [81] and [82] the Full Court said this:
 
 
 '81. It follows that in our opinion the discretion to permit the amendment to raise ground 2(aa) miscarried. In our view this conclusion flows not merely because of the inability of the applicants to particularise the allegation and state the purpose but as a result of the rejection of the logic which underlies the amendment; 
 
 82. We would add that in any event, the lack of particulars and the applicants' inability to state the alleged purpose is a sufficient objection to the grant of leave to amend. In Murchison v Keating (1984) 1 FCR 341 at 344 345, Toohey J referred to the need to provide some particularity of an assertion of the grounds put forward for review under the ADJR Act.'

50 The Full Court expressed concern about the inability of the applicants to particularise the allegation of improper purpose and noted that although improper purpose might be established by inference and is thus a question of fact, there must be something in the application from which the court can conclude that 'there is a real basis for complaint' [86].

51 At [87], the Full Court said this:
 
 'Where improper purpose is alleged, it will usually be necessary to state that purpose. However in some circumstances it may be sufficient to allege that demonstrated absence of a proper purpose leads to the inference of an improper purpose. That was the approach adopted by the applicants in this case. In effect they asserted that the only possible proper purpose (conduct of investigation) was excluded by the available inference that the investigation had been completed. However, we have concluded that such an inference was not available. Thus it is not possible to exclude proper purpose.'

52 In dealing with the previous contention of 'want of power' , the Full Court noted that the first limb was based upon the notion of an exhaustion of power based on the Deed of Settlement and the second limb was based upon questions of construction of the TAA , the AFP Act and other potential Commonwealth legislation. Finkelstein J observed that Ms Jilani's advisers had not analysed the applicable legislation, and thus determined that the construction question ought to go to trial. The Full Court observed, however, that implicit in the applicants' contentions of improper purpose in the proposed amended Ground 2(aa) and the original Ground 2(a) was the concession that the ATO did have power to investigate offences under the Criminal Code but the contention was that the power had been exercised for a purpose other than the investigation of the nominated offences.

53 Although Finkelstein J concluded that the want of power issue going to the conduct of the investigation, calling in aid the AFP in connection with the issue of the warrant and the provision of documents seized on execution of the warrant to the AFP, ought to go to trial, the Full Court noted [95] that these issues were not expressly raised in the terms of the original or the amended application and thus did not fall for consideration in the Application for Leave to Amend.</text>

The Full Court concluded that s 3E of the Crimes Act does not confine applications to individuals who are members of the AFP ( Jilani v Wilhelm at 269 [72]; Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2000) 111 FCR 175 at [128] , per Hely J. As to the contention that the ATO's authority to swear an information in support of a search warrant was exhausted by execution and operation of the Deed of Settlement, the Full Court observed that Finkelstein J was willing to draw such an inference from the applicants' entitlement to collect the documents in accordance with clause 2(c) of the deed.

Nothing in the Deed of Settlement was capable of supporting an allegation that the investigation had been irrevocably terminated ( Jilani v Wilhelm at 269 [75]).

78 The applicants also say that not only is the non-disclosure of the Deed of Settlement related events misleading, the failure to disclose these material matters is the expression of want of good faith and unfairness because Mr Bell, by omission, propagated half truths and engaged in a misrepresentation and thus a breach of duty. The duty is not said to be a general duty of disclosure but a duty inherent in the notion of acting in good faith. The submission of the applicants derives from the observation of Hely J in Williams v Keelty and Others [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 225 [238] that a warrant might be set aside ' for fraud or misrepresentation. For this purpose a statement which is a half-truth and thus misleading, would be treated as a misrepresentation. ' In Williams v Keelty , the applicants contended that ASIC ought to have disclosed the pendency of Supreme Court proceedings, the nature of the proceedings, and that the proceedings involved transactions which overlapped with the extent of the search authorised by the warrant. His Honour noted that consistent with Leggo Distribution Pty Ltd v Paraggio (1994) 52 FCR 542, whether a duty of disclosure arises is a question of statutory construction; no analogous obligation of full disclosure derived from the principles Courts of Equity apply, in considering and granting applications for ex parte injunctions, has any application; and no duty of disclosure as contended arose in ASIC in making application for a warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act. (see: Leggo v Paraggio per Beaumont and Whitlam JJ at p 555 and Hill J at p 569 C-G; Carmody v Mackellar (1997) 76 FCR 115 at 146 149, per Black CJ, Lindgren and Sackville JJ). The important disclosure is the ' disclosure to the issuing justice of matters relevant to the power to issue the warrant ' ( Rogers v Moore (1992) 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J). It is well established that a failure to disclose a particular fact to the issuing officer will not invalidate a warrant unless ' the failure was such as to warrant a conclusion that the decision to grant the warrant was induced by fraud. ' ( Puglisi and Another v Australian Fisheries Management Authority and Others (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 400 per Hill J, noting the ratio of Leggo as expressed in the joint judgment). In Leggo , Hill J put the same principle in terms of ' an absence of good faith ' at p 569.</text>

<text>48 Moreover, the Full Court characterised the Deed of Settlement as a compromise of the civil claims for recovery of the unpaid tax instalments and observed at [76]:
 
 'There was not, nor could there be, any suggestion that the payment of $600,000 for the compromise of the civil claims released Mr Dempsey and Mr Wilhelm from the possibility of criminal prosecution: R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25 ; (1992) 174 CLR 268 at 275 276. Yet the suggestion in ground 1(b), albeit not expressly made, that the payment of the settlement sum and the entitlement to collect the documents, brought to an end the possibility of an investigation into the possible criminal consequences of the applicants' conduct is an essential premise underlying the obligation. In our view, it is unsupportable and should not have been allowed to stand.'</text>

79 In Price v Elder and Others [2000] FCA 133 ; (2000) 97 FCR 218, the appellants contended that an applicant for a warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act is under a duty to disclose to the issuing officer anything known to the applicant relevant to the question of the commission of an offence including exculpatory material and any material that might give rise to a line of inquiry to such material. The Full Court, Black CJ, Sackville and Emmett JJ, refused to depart from the principles established in Leggo v Paraggio and reasserted that a warrant issued as a result of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an applicant is liable to be set aside; and an applicant for a warrant must act in good faith. Adopting the previous formulation, the Full Court said at [12], ' a statement that is a half-truth, and thus misleading, may be treated as a misrepresentation such as to affect the validity of a warrant issued on the basis of that misrepresentation.

<tocase>Banque Commerciale SA en Liquidation v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/11.html</AustLII>
<text>55 The Full Court observed that his Honour's observation to that effect could not stand in the face of well established principle that 'allegations of fraud must be made specifically; see Banque Commerciale SA en Liquidation v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 285'. The Full Court further said this at [100] and [101]: 
 
 
 '100. In the absence of any allegation in the application of want of good faith, we do not see how the matter could proceed to trial on that issue. 
 
 101. In any event, it is one thing to assert trickery or misrepresentation in relation to the execution of the Deed of Settlement. It is quite another to suggest that the exercise of the power to seek the issue of a search warrant in aid of the power to investigate possible criminal offences is similarly tainted.'

56 At paragraphs [3] and [4] of the amended application before Finkelstein J, the applicants sought to review the 'conduct' of Ms Jilani in applying for and executing the warrant and in delivering up the documents to officers of the ATO. The Full Court concluded that the proposed amendments addressing the conduct of Ms Jilani failed to recognise that 'conduct' for the purposes of s 6 of the A D J R Act focuses upon procedural questions whereas the complaint of the applicants was that the process of decision-making itself was flawed and erroneous. Secondly, the conduct in question was not conduct for the purpose of making a decision within the meaning of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd (1996 1997) [1997] HCA 1 ; 189 CLR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>57 The applicants seek leave to amend the primary Application (Order 13, rule 2) and leave to join Mr Bell as a third respondent (Order 6, rule 8). The court exercises a wide discretion in determining whether leave to amend the primary Application ought to be granted. Order 13, rule 2 provides that 'all necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding, or of correcting any defect or error in the proceeding, or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings' . In exercising the discretion, the court must determine whether the applicants are seeking to litigate an issue which is 'fairly arguable' recognising that the ultimate aim of the court in quelling any controversy is to secure the attainment of justice between the parties to the controversy ( Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd (1996 1997) [1997] HCA 1 ; 189 CLR 146 at 154 per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). Further, the fact that the proposed amendment may possibly be met by a substantive defence on the part of the respondents does not, of itself, suggest any reason for refusing an amendment. In circumstances where a party seeks to introduce a substantial additional ground of challenge to the decisions of the respondents, the applicants should be permitted to argue such a ground provided the ground is 'arguable'. In the exercise of the discretion, the applicants ought not to be shut out of raising an arguable contention. Similarly, in determining whether Mr Bell ought to be joined as a third respondent in the proceeding, the question is whether the applicants have demonstrated that they have an arguable case against Mr Bell in the terms formulated in the proposed amendment. If so, Mr Bell will be joined as a necessary party to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceeding may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon (Order 6, rule 8(1)(b)). The question then is whether the applicants have demonstrated an arguable case in relation to the proposed amendments and the joinder of Mr Bell.</text>

61 Mindful of the important cautionary observations of their Honours in the joint judgment in Griffith University v Tang concerning the risks necessarily inherent in a disjunctive consideration of each element comprising the expression 'a decision of an administrative character made or acquired to be made under an enactment' , it nevertheless remains important to consider whether Mr Bell has reached a 'decision of an administrative character' . In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321, Mason CJ with whom Brennan and Deane JJ agreed considered that a decision must reflect something in the nature of a resolution or determination of matters the subject of inquiry or dispute and those matters ought to reflect a question of substance. At pages 335 337, Mason CJ said this:
 
 'The fact that the AD (JR) Act is a remedial statute providing for a review of administrative action rather than some form of appeal from decisions disposing of issues between parties indicates that no narrow view should be taken of the word "decision". 
 
 
 
 Nonetheless, other considerations point to the word having a relatively limited field of operation. 
 
 First, the reference in the definition in s 3(1) to "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" indicates the reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision. 
 
 Secondly, the examples of decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute or, in the words of Deane J, "a determination effectively resolving an actual substantive issue". 
 
 Thirdly, s 3(3), in extending the concept of "decision" to include "the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power", to that extent qualifies the characteristic of finality. Such a provision would have been unnecessary had the Parliament intended that "decision"' comprehend every decision, or every substantive decision, made in the course of reaching a conclusive determination. 
 
 Finally, s 3(5) suggests that acts done preparatory to the making of a "decision" are not to be regarded as constituting "decisions" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of "conduct" as well as of a "decision". 
 
 ... a "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute. That will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration. A conclusion reached as a step along the way in a course of reasoning leading to an ultimate decision would not ordinarily amount to a reviewable decision, unless the statute provided for the making of a finding or ruling on that point so that the decision, though an intermediate decision, might accurately be described as a decision under an enactment. 
 
 Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination. With the exception of s 3(2)(g), the incidences of decision mentioned in s 3(2) are all substantive in character. Moreover, the provisions in sub-ss(1), (2), (3) and (5) of s 3 point to a substantive determination. In this context the reference in s 3(2)(g) to "doing or refusing to do any other act or thing (emphasis added) should be read as referring to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power. 
 
 If "decision" were to embrace procedural determinations, then there would be little scope for review of "conduct", a concept which appears to be essentially procedural in character'.

63 The decision of Mr Bell to swear and apply for the search warrant before Mr McKay SM does not reflect the character or quality of an operative decision in terms of the formulation of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond . The phrase 'of an administrative character' necessarily informs the notion of the 'decision' and in addressing that question their Honours Gummow, Callinan and Heydon in the joint judgment in Griffith University v Tang said this at [79] and [80]:
 
 
 '[79] The decisions so required or authorised must be "of an administrative character". This element of the decision casts some light on the force to be given by the phrase "under an enactment". What is it, in the course of administration, that flows from or arises out of the decision taken so as to give that significance which has merited the legislative conferral of a right of judicial review upon those aggrieved? 
 
 
 
 
 
 [80] The answer in general terms is the affecting of legal rights and obligations. Do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision, or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement? [R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett [1945] HCA 50 ; (1945) 70 CLR 141 at 154]. To adapt what was said by Lehane J in [Australian National University v Lewins (1996) 68 FCR 87 at 103] , does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations? Are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general law but by virtue of the statute? [General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 169].'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/7.html</AustLII>
<text>60 In Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99, the question for determination was whether a decision of Griffith University to exclude Ms Tang from a doctoral candidature program conducted by the University was a decision made under the Griffith University Act 1998 (Qld), in the context of proceedings under the Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld). Their Honours, Gleeson CJ, and in a separate joint judgment, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ, concluded that it was not. In the joint judgment, their Honours observed that there is conceptual risk in analysing the elements of 'decision', 'of an administrative character' and made 'under an enactment' separately because notions inherent in each necessarily inform the other collectively. In particular, the question of whether a decision in question is a 'decision of an administrative character' informs whether the decision is one made 'under an enactment'.

61 Mindful of the important cautionary observations of their Honours in the joint judgment in Griffith University v Tang concerning the risks necessarily inherent in a disjunctive consideration of each element comprising the expression 'a decision of an administrative character made or acquired to be made under an enactment' , it nevertheless remains important to consider whether Mr Bell has reached a 'decision of an administrative character' .

67 Section 3E of the Crimes Act informs an applicant that an issuing officer will be required to reach a state of satisfaction as to a reasonable ground for suspicion about the relevant matters supported by information on oath. At [89], Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ observed:
 
 'The determination of whether a decision is "made ... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment. A decision will only be "made ... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met. It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise. Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question. Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice'.</text>

69 Although it is clear that a decision to issue the warrant is susceptible of review for the purposes of the A D J R Act as the decision is expressly authorised by s 3E of the Crimes Act and affects legal rights and obligations of the applicants, the steps taken by Mr Bell neither find their express authority in the section nor materially affect the rights and obligations of the applicants.

The duty is not said to be a general duty of disclosure but a duty inherent in the notion of acting in good faith. The submission of the applicants derives from the observation of Hely J in Williams v Keelty and Others [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 225 [238] that a warrant might be set aside ' for fraud or misrepresentation.

<text>79 In Price v Elder and Others [2000] FCA 133 ; (2000) 97 FCR 218, the appellants contended that an applicant for a warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act is under a duty to disclose to the issuing officer anything known to the applicant relevant to the question of the commission of an offence including exculpatory material and any material that might give rise to a line of inquiry to such material. The Full Court, Black CJ, Sackville and Emmett JJ, refused to depart from the principles established in Leggo v Paraggio and reasserted that a warrant issued as a result of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an applicant is liable to be set aside; and an applicant for a warrant must act in good faith. Adopting the previous formulation, the Full Court said at [12], ' a statement that is a half-truth, and thus misleading, may be treated as a misrepresentation such as to affect the validity of a warrant issued on the basis of that misrepresentation.

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/23.html</AustLII>
<text>99 Part IVA confers powers on the Commissioner to form ' opinions ' concerning a 'scheme' (as defined) to reduce income tax which a taxpayer has entered into or carried out for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit (s 177, particularly s 177D and 177F; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168) and a power to make determinations (s 177F) to include amounts in the assessable income of the taxpayer or disallow deductions, among other determinations. These expressly conferred powers (among other express powers) enable, properly exercised, the Commissioner to examine and investigate sources of information, facts, and circumstances that enable conclusions to be reached as to whether a taxpayer has complied with the tax law; whether the Commissioner's assessment of the tax payable by the taxpayer properly and accurately reflects the amount of the taxpayers liability to taxation under Part III of the ITAA 36; and whether a basis subsists for forming opinions, making determinations or exercising discretions as to any relevant matter for the purposes of the ITAA 36, the ITAA 97 or the TAA.

100 In addition to expressly conferred powers, the Commissioner is charged with the general administration of the tax law. Apart from s 8 of the ITAA 36, s 3A of the TAA confers the general administration of the TAA on the Commissioner. The Commissioner must each year provide a report to the Minister on the working of each Act (inclusively defined) s 14 ITAA 36; s 3B TAA. Each Act imposes general secrecy requirements upon ATO officers concerning information acquired by that officer or information obtained under the provisions of the legislation (for example, s 16(2) ITAA 36, subject to exclusions). One such exclusion is disclosure of information for the purposes of or in connection with the prosecution of a tax related offence against an Act administered by the Commissioner or an offence against the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 (Cth) or the Crimes Act .

101 The secrecy provision in the TAA, subject to permitted disclosures, applies to an officer, who, by reason of employment, or in the exercise of powers or functions, acquires or obtains information for the purposes of the Act. The Commissioner's report to the Minister must set out in relation to each general category of offence, information disclosed to a defined 'law enforcement agency' including the Australian Crime Commission. Section 3D(1) of the TAA provides that 'notwithstanding anything in a taxation secrecy provision, the Commissioner may communicate information to the Chief Executive Officer of the ACC for the purposes of a tax-related investigation.' Similarly, the limitation contained in s 3D(11) of the TAA does not prevent disclosure of information in connection with the prosecution of a person for a taxation offence (s 3D(16)). Section 3E(1) of the TAA provides that the Commissioner may disclose information acquired by the Commissioner under a tax law, to an authorised law enforcement agency officer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to 'establishing whether a serious offence has been, or is being committed'. Nothing prohibits a law enforcement agency officer, put broadly, dealing with the information for the purpose of a possible prosecution of a person for a tax-related offence (s 3E(4)).</text>

<text>108 It can be seen from these provisions that the powers of the Commissioner are wide-ranging. They comprehend an administrative power both under the ITTA 36 and the TAA to examine the conduct of a taxpayer to determine whether a taxpayer has, according to law, accurately identified the taxable income upon which tax is levied. In undertaking that examination or investigation for the purposes of the ITAA 36, ITAA 97 or the TAA, the Commissioner may exercise express powers such as those contained in ss 263 and 264 . The general administration of the legislation also comprehends a power to examine the conduct of a taxpayer not just to determine whether an assessment or an amended assessment issued by the Commissioner in reliance upon self assessment details supplied by the taxpayer is, in the light of proper analysis or audit (see Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ), an accurate assessment of the taxpayer's liability to tax for the purposes of Part III but also whether the taxpayer has engaged in conduct which constitutes the commission of an offence against a tax law or a tax-related offence including offences against the Criminal Code and in particular, ss 134.4, 134.2, 135.1, 135.2 and 135.4 being an offence that relates to a liability to the Commonwealth arising under or by virtue of, a tax law.</text>

<text>109 The TAA contemplates that information might be disclosed to prosecutorial bodies or law enforcement agencies for the purposes of the tax law. Inherent in the secrecy constraints and the prescription of the conditions upon which information might be disclosed is the recognition that the Commissioner has information made up not only of information supplied by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of self assessment but information obtained by the Commissioner through the exercise of powers, for the purposes of the Act. The general administrative power comprehends that the Commissioner may seek to closely investigate particular arrangements put in place by a taxpayer and especially those involving complex structural arrangements reflecting interposed entities, offshore payments or receipts, inter-company transactions and other arrangements which might reflect tax related contraventions of the Criminal Law of the Commonwealth. The Commissioner may seek to pursue an investigation through his own officers or may seek to cooperatively engage law enforcement agencies especially the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Australian Federal Police (see Grofam Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1993) 116 ALR 535).

110 In circumstances where the arrangements under examination involve complex financial analysis, no doubt the Commissioner's officers would undertake such investigation or analysis, form a view and where appropriate brief law enforcement agencies with an assessment of the consequences of the conduct. The failure to confer an express power upon the Commissioner by operation of the Criminal Code , the AFP Act or the Crimes Act does not lead to a construction that the Commissioner does not have the power to conduct an investigation of conduct which might express itself in the form of a contravention of the Criminal Law of the Commonwealth concerning tax related matters. The source and repository of prosecutorial power in respect of any particular offence is another question.

111 The role of law enforcement agencies in connection with the investigation of the possible commission of offences by taxpayers or the possible prosecution of taxpayers by law enforcement agencies does not lead to the conclusion as a question of construction of the ITAA 36, ITAA 97 or the TAA that only a law enforcement agency has power to investigate conduct which finds its expression in the commission of an offence and in particular, the commission of an offence against s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code by conduct involving, as contended in this case, a deception to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from the Commissioner by securing a reduction in the quantum of the tax debt owed to the Commissioner by entities associated with the directors Wilhelm and Dempsey.

112 The ITAA 36, ITAA 97 and the TAA establishes a regime, particularly having regard to the self assessment arrangements provided for by the tax legislation, by which all taxpayers are susceptible of audit or investigation, for the purposes of the legislation, by officers of the Commissioner, exercised in good faith according to the terms of the power, to seek to ensure as a matter of important public administrative policy and thus public confidence in the administration of the tax law, that taxpayers comply with the law relating to taxation. The administrative power is not exercised simply, although critically, to secure payment to the Commissioner of the contended tax debt due to the Commonwealth but to deploy resources to examine conduct of a taxpayer by which a tax liability under the Act may potentially not have been met or whether an assessment might be susceptible of adjustment, and determine by forensic examination and investigation of the particular arrangements, whether an offence necessarily connected with or arising under or by virtue of a tax law has arguably been committed.

113 One important aspect of the administration of the tax law in a civil society is that the Commissioner's power of investigation of tax related conduct that might involve a contravention of Commonwealth criminal law can not be foreclosed by payment by the taxpayer to the Commissioner of the amount of the unpaid tax (including interest and penalties) arising out of the conduct. Otherwise, a resourced taxpayer could simply pay his or her way out of an investigation by the Commissioner of whether a criminal offence also occurred.</text>
