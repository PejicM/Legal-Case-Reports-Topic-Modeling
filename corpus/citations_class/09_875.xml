<tocase>Auckland Harbour Board v R [1924] AC 318</tocase>
<text>The Court is not satisfied that the Tribunal considered itself ' legally bound ' by such a consideration. Rather it referred to the fact that it was ' the starting point in considering exercise of discretion ', that is, that the Tribunal expressly acknowledged that despite such initial position, the discretion continues to exist. There is authority for the proposition that a payment made from consolidated revenue, unsupported by a valid appropriation, should be recovered: see Auckland Harbour Board v R [1924] AC 318 ; see also Sheppard J in Director General of Social Services v Hales [1983] FCA 81 ; (1983) 47 ALR 281 at 322-323 where his Honour said that a ' paramount consideration ' in such cases is the receipt by the person of monies unlawfully paid to them from consolidated revenue and that therefore it ought to, unless other circumstances exist, be repaid. Mere reference to such proposition as a starting point of consideration did not suggest that such proposition unduly fettered the Tribunal's decision.</text>

<tocase>Chapman v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2001] FCA 594 ; (2001) 108 FCR 537</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/594.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondent's interpretation arises from a misunderstanding of the relevant sections of the DFRDB Act. The same misunderstanding arose in the proceedings before the Full Federal Court in Chapman v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2001] FCA 594 ; (2001) 108 FCR 537. In Chapman [2001] FCA 594 ; 108 FCR 537 the Full Court held that s 5A(1) excluded eligibility for membership of the DFRDB Act for any person commencing continuous full-time service after 1 October 1991. The majority (Whitlam and Gyles JJ) considered that s 5A(1)(b) applied to Major Chapman. They said at [21]: 
 Section 5A(1) of the DFRDB Act makes the date 1 October 1991 a watershed. Eligibility, by operation of s 3 of the DFRDB Act, depends upon current continuous full-time service of certain kinds by members of the Defence Force, of whatever status. Section 5A(1) makes clear that, in general, any person actually joining the Defence Force in any capacity from 1 October 1991 will in no circumstances ever become eligible. Any person who was then a member of the Permanent Force will clearly continue to be eligible because of the full-time service obligation of that person... In this fashion, subs 5A(1) as a whole excludes eligibility for any person commencing continuous full-time service after 1 October 1991.

Wilcox J considered the same submission which is made in the present proceedings by the respondent, namely that he could not ' become ' a member of the Defence Force after 1 October 1991 because he remained, at all material times, a member of the Defence Force. Wilcox J dismissed such submission, finding at [8] of his decision that the deeming provisions of the DFRDB Act contained in s 5(2), when taken into consideration with the definition of ' retirement ' contained in s 3 of that Act, had the consequence that ' regardless of the true position, the appellant was deemed to have retired from the Defence Force when he ceased in 1988 to be a member of the Australian Regular Army and transferred to the Australian Army Reserve '. His Honour considered that s 5A(1)(a) applied rather than s 5A(1)(b).

Wilcox J concluded at [8]: 
 On that basis, he once again became a member of the Defence Force when he commenced in 1996 to render continuous full-time service.

It is also instructive to consider the judgment of Weinberg J at first instance in Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Chapman (2000) 63 ALD 351. The Full Federal Court's decision in Chapman [2001] FCA 594 ; 108 FCR 537 does not bring into question the reasoning of Weinberg J at first instance. Rather, it affirms it. The reasoning of Wilcox J in the Full Federal Court decision is consistent with Weinberg J's observations in relation to s 5A(1)(a) of the DFRDB Act and the majority decision in Chapman [2001] FCA 594 ; 108 FCR 537 does not challenge such reasoning as their Honours, considering s 5A(1)(b) was applicable to Major Chapman's circumstances, said ' it is unnecessary to consider other bases for ineligibility '. That is, the majority did not make any finding in relation to s 5A(1)(a). Therefore, Weinberg J's decision, and reasons, are still good law in respect of his interpretation of s 5A(1)(a). Chapman [2001] FCA 594 ; 108 FCR 537 was silent on the interpretation of s 5(3) of the DFRDB Act. None of their Honours considered the section. The majority did not need to as s 5 as a whole was irrelevant for the purposes of s 5A(1)(b). It can be assumed that Wilcox J considered that Weinberg J's findings in relation to that section were correct as he did not mention s 5(3) even though he relied on s 5A(1)(a).

The fact that the majority of Chapman [2001] FCA 594 ; 108 FCR 537 decided that Major Chapman fell under s 5A(1)(b) rather than 5(1)(a) has no consequence for the present purposes. The respondent's election under s 132 is equally irrelevant. The Court is not bound by Chapman . However, the Court would need sound reasons to depart from considered, well-reasoned findings by members of this Court regarding the interpretation of provisions which are directly relevant to the current proceedings. The Court respectfully adopts the reasoning of the Full Court as well as Weinberg J in Chapman 63 ALD 351 which proceeds along similar lines.

It follows from the above that the points of distinction relied upon by the respondent do not distinguish his circumstances from that considered in both Chapman decisions. The respondent's interpretation of s 5(3)

Section 3(1) of the DFRDB Act provides: 
 "service" means service as a member of the Defence Force.</text>

<tocase>Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Lokan [2008] FCAFC 43</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/43.html</AustLII>
<text>It is essential for the resolution of the present issue to define the scope of such discretion. It was accepted by both parties in these proceedings that the Tribunal had a wide discretion under s 126(4). That is, the Tribunal had the discretion to order recovery of the whole amount of the overpayment or not recover the whole amount, as well as the discretion to recover only part of the whole amount. It is arguable s 126(4) does not grant such a broad discretion, given that it is worded ' where for any reason... an amount of benefit has been paid that is not payable ... the amount so paid may be recovered by the Authority ' (emphasis added). However, the Full Federal Court in Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Lokan [2008] FCAFC 43 at [1] did not question the proposition put before it, namely that by virtue of s 126(4) ' the AAT had a discretion that allowed it not to order the recovery of the full amount '. Accordingly, this Court will follow such interpretation.

The issue then becomes one of construction of the Tribunal's decision. The Authority submits that, after considering all of the circumstances, the Tribunal exercised is discretion to recover the overpayment. Having made such finding, the Authority submits it was not open to the Tribunal to then decide that the tax component of the overpayment need not be recovered.

The Authority cites [55] of the decision in its favour. The Tribunal found in such paragraph: 
 Unfortunately for Mr Gregory, the circumstances described by him, including administrative errors, misleading information and delay by the respondent in attending to his overpayment, are insufficient reason for not recovering the debt. For these reasons, the discretion to recover the overpayment cannot be exercised in his favour. 

The Authority's submission proceeds from a misunderstanding of the decision of the Tribunal and overlooks the fact that such statement was only made following the Tribunal's discussion regarding the tax component of the overpayment. At [53] Tribunal found, ' I consider Mr Gregory is not liable to pay the outstanding $9,939 to the respondent. This amount should be deducted from the overpayment... I am unable to see any justification for requiring Mr Gregory to bear the burden of recovering this money '. At [54] it found: 
 
 In balancing all relevant factors, and bearing in mind that the paramount consideration is that Mr Gregory received public monies to which he was not entitled, I find that the debt must be recovered. The decision to recover the overpayment, however, should be varied in order to substitute the amount actually received by Mr Gregory less tax deducted. 

Only then did the Tribunal move on to say what was extracted from [55]. In short, it cannot be said that the Tribunal exhausted its discretion at [55] and then went on to treat the tax component differently because it had already discussed the tax component. The only debt which the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, found was owing was the net amount received by the respondent. That is, the monies actually received by him excluding the amount which was paid to the Commissioner.

The Tribunal cited the decision of Deputy President Hack in Lokan and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2007] AATA 1652. In that decision his Honour said at [13]-[15], ' Mr Lokan got no benefit from the PAYG instalments because they represented tax payable on monies to which he was not entitled... In my view, there is no practical benefit that would be achieved by requiring Mr Lokan to repay the PAYG instalments '. However, the Full Federal Court on appeal in Lokan [2008] FCAFC 43 made the following consent orders: The appeal be allowed. The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 9 August 2007 that the respondent repay to the applicant the sum of $21,352.86 be set aside. The respondent repay to the applicant by way of fortnightly instalments of $300.00 the sum of $29,791.86, commencing 28 days after the date the Court affixes the stamp of the Court to these orders. The decisions of the applicant dated 31 October 2006 and 23 March 2007 be affirmed. There be no order as to costs. 
Their Honours were aware of the deficiencies in the Tribunal decision before them, stating at [7] ' there was no evidence before the Tribunal that would support that conclusion [namely that there would be no ' practical benefit ']'. The Full Federal Court decision thus overturned the decision of Deputy President Hack and the decision should not have been relied upon by the Tribunal.</text>

<text>The Court is not satisfied that the Tribunal considered itself ' legally bound ' by such a consideration. Rather it referred to the fact that it was ' the starting point in considering exercise of discretion ', that is, that the Tribunal expressly acknowledged that despite such initial position, the discretion continues to exist. There is authority for the proposition that a payment made from consolidated revenue, unsupported by a valid appropriation, should be recovered: see Auckland Harbour Board v R [1924] AC 318 ; see also Sheppard J in Director General of Social Services v Hales [1983] FCA 81 ; (1983) 47 ALR 281 at 322-323 where his Honour said that a ' paramount consideration ' in such cases is the receipt by the person of monies unlawfully paid to them from consolidated revenue and that therefore it ought to, unless other circumstances exist, be repaid. Mere reference to such proposition as a starting point of consideration did not suggest that such proposition unduly fettered the Tribunal's decision.

The Authority does not challenge the proposition that a discretion was vested in the Tribunal when it applied s 126(4) of the DFRDB Act. In the exercise of that discretion it was open to the decision maker to have regard to an unlimited range of matters, subject to their relevance, including the question whether compassionate considerations should apply: see Sheppard J in Hales at 321.</text>

<tocase>Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2) (1979) 2 ALD 634</tocase>
<text>The Court finds that there is no evidence that the Tribunal erroneously exercised its discretion because it considered the Debt Recovery Policy. Rather, the Tribunal had regard to such policy as relevant policy instrument. Such reference results in consistency in administrative decision-making: see Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2) (1979) 2 ALD 634 at 680.

In ground 2.9 the respondent submits that the Tribunal erred at [47] when considering itself ' legally bound ' to adopt a prima facie position that ' monies must be repaid unless there is some strong or cogent reason why policy may be overcome '. The respondent submits the Tribunal so erred because there is no such prima facie rule and the discretion at s 126(4) of the DFRDB Act contains no such fetter.</text>
