<tocase>Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Burn v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434</tocase>
<text>88 In order to succeed in a claim for a breach of confidence, Bluescope and Castrip must first identify, with some specificity, information that is said to be confidential. Next, they must show that the information has the necessary quality of confidentiality. Finally, they must show that the information was received in such circumstances as to import an obligation of confidence. There may then be an injunction to restrain threatened disclosure and there may be an account of profits in respect of actual disclosure ( Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Burn v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 at 443).</text>

<tocase>Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/54.html</AustLII>
<text>161 The claim by Bluescope and Castrip for an account of profits requires a determination of the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K.Con from any wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information. The Court, in calculating the quantum of profit, must make such approximation as will do justice to the parties ( Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101 at 119).

162 K.Con received sums totalling $1,484,238.16 from Danieli. K.Con paid $333,802 to Messrs Sorensen, Minter, Russell, Zancolich and their respective companies and incurred travelling and other expenses of $41,934.37. Bluescope and Castrip assert that the net amount of $1,108,501.79 is the profit derived by Mr Kelly and K.Con from their wrongful use or disclosure of the relevant information.

163 While that calculation of profit makes an allowance for amounts paid to Messrs Sorensen, Minter, Russell, Zancolich and their companies and travelling and other expenses, it makes no other allowance for the cost of deriving the fees. Nor does it make allowance for information provided to Danieli that did not consist of confidential information relating to Project M. Danieli received information and assistance from K.Con, in exchange for the fees of $1,484,238, that was not confidential information belonging to Bluescope and Castrip. It is tolerably clear that Danieli also obtained benefit derived from Mr Kelly's wealth of experience in steel making over some 40 years. It would not have been possible for Mr Kelly or K.Con to disclose the specific information that has been identified except through an individual who has Mr Kelly's wealth of experience in steel making.

164 Bluescope and Castrip contend that, without the confidential information relating to Project M, neither Mr Kelly nor K.Con would have been retained by Danieli at all. They say that the whole arrangement involving the Consultancy Agreement between K.Con, on the one hand, and Danieli, on the other, came about only by reason of the wrongful use of the confidential information obtained by Mr Kelly from Bluescope. They say that Danieli only paid K.Con in exchange for receiving confidential Project M information. Had K.Con not been in a position to provide confidential Project M information, Danieli would have paid nothing at all. Accordingly, they say, the net amount represents profit obtained by K.Con from unlawful conduct (see Dart Industries at 119-120).

165 It may be that an inference can be drawn that Danieli was interested in entering into arrangements with Mr Kelly and K.Con because of Mr Kelly's involvement with Project M. However, it by no means follows that Danieli's object was to obtain confidential information relating to Project M, in breach of Mr Kelly's obligations of confidence to his employer. Bluescope and Castrip do not contend, and they have certainly not established, that all of the information imparted by Mr Kelly, either directly or through K.Con, to Danieli involved a breach of Mr Kelly's obligations of confidence. On the other hand, it is for Mr Kelly to demonstrate the extent to which any benefit he received in connection with any breach of duty is attributable to his own effort, expertise and know how beyond the mere disclosure of confidential information.</text>

<tocase>Faccenda Chicken Limited v Fowler [1985] FSR 105</tocase>
<text>90 There is a category of information that an employee must treat as confidential but which, once learned, necessarily remains in the head of the employee and becomes part of his own skill and knowledge. While that information may have been acquired in the course of the employer's business, the employee will be allowed to use his full skill and knowledge for his own benefit, even in competition with his former employer after he leaves that employment. Such information is often referred to as " know how ", being the skill and knowledge that an employee gains during the course of his employment, which is not capable of protection in favour of the employer. Even so, however, that type of information may be protected from use or disclosure by express contractual arrangement (see Faccenda Chicken Limited v Fowler [1985] FSR 105 and Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd at 326F and 333G-334E). Such a contractual arrangement will be enforced unless it is contrary to public policy, as being an unreasonable restraint of trade. That is to say, it will not be enforced if its effect is to deprive an employee of the ability to earn a living without adequate compensation.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 10 ; (2003) 56 NSWLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2003/10.html</AustLII>
<text>166 The object of the taking of accounts in a case such as this is to determine the profit derived by the wrong doer from the use of the confidential information. Whether it is appropriate to make an allowance in respect of Mr Kelly's skill, expertise and other expenses is a matter of judgment. As a general rule, consistently with the principle that a fiduciary must not profit from a breach of fiduciary duty, the Court will make allowance for skill, expertise and other expenses ( Warman International Ltd v Dwyer [1995] HCA 18 ; (1995) 182 CLR 544 at 562). The grant of an allowance will normally be a substitute for an apportionment of profits where a wrong doer mingled profits attributable to breach of duty and profits attributable to the wrong doer's efforts. That suggests that the onus of establishing that an allowance for skill, expertise and other expenses is called for, is on the wrong doer ( Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 10 ; (2003) 56 NSWLR 298 at [335] ).</text>

<tocase>Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 317</tocase>
<text>89 In determining whether the information in question has the necessary quality of confidentiality, the fact that the information is jealously guarded by the claimant, that it is not readily made available to employees and that it could not, without considerable effort and risk, be acquired by others, is a relevant consideration. The fact that considerable skill and effort was actually expanded to acquire the information is also a relevant consideration ( Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 317 at 334).
