<tocase>M52 and M53 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1495</tocase>

<text>4 On 2 May 2002, the appellant applied to the High Court of Australia, seeking relief under s 75(v) of the Constitution in relation to the Tribunal's decision. The High Court remitted that proceeding to this Court. On 5 December 2003, Heerey J dismissed that application. His Honour's reasons are published as M52 and M53 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1495. Those reasons make it clear that his Honour did not give judgment on the merits, but rather dismissed the application on an interlocutory basis, because the appellant had failed to lodge it within the time limits fixed by the High Court Rules, and his Honour refused to extend the times so fixed.

5 The appellant appealed from the judgment of Heerey J. On 6 May 2004, a Full Court of this Court refused to extend the time for filing an application for leave to appeal, refused leave to appeal, and dismissed the appellant's purported appeal as incompetent. Although there appear to be no published reasons of the Full Court, it is plain that the Full Court regarded the judgment of Heerey J as an interlocutory judgment, from which leave to appeal was necessary.</text>

<tocase>MZWGV v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 980</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2005/980.html</AustLII>
<text>6 On 13 May 2004, the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the Tribunal's decision. On 6 April 2005 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that proceeding. The reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on that occasion have been published as MZWGV v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 980. They indicate that the learned federal magistrate dismissed the application on the basis that his Honour considered that the appellant was estopped by the previous judgments of North J and Heerey J, and the judgment of the Full Court of this Court, from applying again at all to have the Tribunal decision set aside. His Honour also took the view that the Federal Magistrates Court should not be seen to be reviewing decisions made by Federal Court judges. On 6 April 2005, as well as dismissing the appellant's application with costs, the federal magistrate also ordered that there be no further applications brought by the appellant with respect to the Tribunal's decision except by leave of the Federal Magistrates Court.

21 It does seem to me that, if the appellant could have made a case that he had a ground on which he could have sought to set aside the Tribunal's decision, which was a ground not available to him under the provisions of Pt 8 of the Migration Act , as they stood at the time of his application to this Court that was dealt with by North J, then he might still have been able to make an application to set aside the decision of the Tribunal at the time when he made his first application to the Federal Magistrates Court, and even at the time when he made his second. In my view, in the first of the federal magistrate's judgments, his Honour was wrong to regard the entire matter as being one of estoppel against the appellant from bringing any application on any ground in respect of the Tribunal's decision. For the reasons I have set out in Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 at [54] [71], it seems to me that it would have been open to the appellant to raise a ground that he could not have raised under the provisions of Pt 8 of the Migration Act as they stood at the time of his first application to the Court, because whatever grounds he raised before the High Court had not been the subject of judgment on the merits, and no estoppel was therefore raised in respect of them. It is true that there might be issues of Anshun estoppel, but these would have to be matters of argument.</text>

<tocase>MZXAF v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 979</tocase>

<text>7 Notwithstanding that order, on 23 May 2005 the appellant applied again to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the Tribunal decision. On 2 June 2005, the same federal magistrate again dismissed that application with costs. The federal magistrate's reasons for judgment are published as MZXAF v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 979. After referring to the order made on 6 April 2005, his Honour said at [5] [6]:
 
 
 'The applicant's only basis for bringing the further application is that he says he now has some witnesses. This would not have been an arguable ground for review, even on his first application. 
 
 Where an applicant is the subject of an order not to bring further applications without the leave of the court the appropriate step to take before bringing a further application for review is to apply for leave. A leave application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the facts and circumstances relied upon to show that leave should be granted. A copy of the proposed application should be annexed to the affidavit.' 
 
 

The reasons make clear that, because of the fact that the appellant had not sought the leave of the Court before bringing his application, his Honour saw fit to dismiss the application.

8 On 6 June 2005, the appellant filed in this Court what is, in form, a notice of appeal from the judgment of the federal magistrate given on 2 June 2005. The grounds of appeal specified in the notice of appeal read as follows:
 

 
 
 '1. I disagree with the decision of the Federal Magistrates [ sic ] because there was an error in this decision. Details I will provide as soon as I 
 received [ sic ] the judgement [ sic ]. 
 


 
 
 2. There was procedural error in the court's decision. The original date 
 of this hearing is on 22nd of June 2005. But it was advanced to 2nd of June 2005. This hearing was heard by telephone. The Judge failed to consider my case inaccordance [ sic ] with the law of the country. I believe that this was abreach [ sic ] of natural Justice. Further, I believe this was the abreach [ sic ] of the human rights &amp; also the procedure of the court. 
 


 
 3. I believe that the court only listening the [ sic ] Minister of Immigration 
 &amp; their Lawyers but not the applicant. This I believe an error of the court procedure &amp; also Bias and unfair.'

9 I dealt with the matter by way of directions hearing on 8 August 2005. Among the directions that I gave was a direction that, on or before 22 August 2005, the appellant file and serve any application for leave to appeal, any application to enlarge the time for applying for leave to appeal, and any affidavit or other document on which the appellant seeks to rely on the hearing of the appeal or any application for leave to appeal or for enlargement of time.</text>

<text>21 It does seem to me that, if the appellant could have made a case that he had a ground on which he could have sought to set aside the Tribunal's decision, which was a ground not available to him under the provisions of Pt 8 of the Migration Act , as they stood at the time of his application to this Court that was dealt with by North J, then he might still have been able to make an application to set aside the decision of the Tribunal at the time when he made his first application to the Federal Magistrates Court, and even at the time when he made his second. In my view, in the first of the federal magistrate's judgments, his Honour was wrong to regard the entire matter as being one of estoppel against the appellant from bringing any application on any ground in respect of the Tribunal's decision. For the reasons I have set out in Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 at [54] [71], it seems to me that it would have been open to the appellant to raise a ground that he could not have raised under the provisions of Pt 8 of the Migration Act as they stood at the time of his first application to the Court, because whatever grounds he raised before the High Court had not been the subject of judgment on the merits, and no estoppel was therefore raised in respect of them. It is true that there might be issues of Anshun estoppel, but these would have to be matters of argument.

23 I sought to ascertain from the appellant, in the course of argument, whether there was any substance in his allegation that the Tribunal had failed to provide him with copies of documents on which it relied, and had failed to give him an opportunity to comment on them. The affidavit with which his law clerk friend helped him did not identify those documents. Nor was the appellant able to identify to me any document used by the Tribunal, which affected the decision adversely to the appellant, and on which he was not given an opportunity to comment. I point out that, even if there were documents, such as the sources of information used by the Tribunal to ascertain the position in the Punjab, and in India generally, at the time of its decision, it would have been sufficient for the purposes of the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness for the Tribunal to have given the appellant an opportunity to comment on the substance of the information contained in those documents. It would be necessary to examine the transcript of the Tribunal's hearing to see whether this had in fact been done. All that can be said is that, if the appellant had been able to raise a case of denial of natural justice, or procedural fairness, that is not a ground on which he could have applied to this Court in 2000, when Pt 8 of the Migration Act contained provisions specifically barring this Court from examining Tribunal decisions on the basis of natural justice. It was not a ground on which there has been any final judgment of any court, and therefore, on the reasoning set out in the passage in Applicants M16 of 2004 , to which I have referred, it is a ground that would have been available to the appellant. It cannot be said that the appellant would succeed on it, because much more would need to be done.

24 So far as the argument today is concerned, the appellant has not indicated that he would have been able to make out a case with respect to any documents. As I have said, he has not been able to identify documents that affected the decision adversely to him, or about which he was given no opportunity to comment. The only view I can take, therefore, is that, as a matter of substance, the appellant has no ground available to him on which he could seek to set aside the Tribunal's decision. This is a powerful reason in itself for refusing him leave to appeal.

25 As to the appellant's complaints about the federal magistrate's judgment, there is not much to be said. He complains that the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court was originally set for 22 June 2005, but was brought forward to 2 June. He does not indicate how this disadvantaged him. In answer to questions from me this morning, he indicated that he did not complain to the federal magistrate about the change of date, and did not allege that he was disadvantaged in the presentation of his case in the hearing before the federal magistrate, which apparently was conducted by telephone.</text>
