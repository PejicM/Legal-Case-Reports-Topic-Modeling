<tocase>Dickason v Dickason [1913] HCA 77 ; (1913) 17 CLR 50</tocase>

<text>Ordinarily, the principles of open justice require that all evidence before a court be open to the public gaze. This achieves the important objective of transparency in judicial decision-making. That is fundamental to the proper administration of justice and public confidence in the integrity and independence of the Courts and their decisions. But, it is an objective which, on occasion, must be balanced against the paramount duty of the Court to do justice. In Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 437-438, Viscount Haldane LC explained these principles, which have been followed and accepted as fundamental in Australia since Dickason v Dickason [1913] HCA 77 ; (1913) 17 CLR 50 at 51 per Barton ACJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, Powers and Rich JJ. One of the exceptions to which his Lordship referred was the protection of secret processes and confidential information.</text>

<tocase>John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465</tocase>
<text>The Court may only depart from exercising its jurisdiction fully in public where, and then only to the extent that, the departure is necessary in the interests of justice or where legislation has altered the open justice rule: John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476G-477A per McHugh JA, Glass JA agreeing. Even in the latter situation, the legislative power to affect the conduct of the proceedings of a court exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be used to achieve a result that is not compatible with the implied Constitutional freedom of communication on government and political matter: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 at 567-568 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [2000] NSWCA 198 ; (2000) 181 ALR 694 at 703-707 [52] - [75] , 715-716 [114]-[119] per Spigelman CJ, 721 [157] per Priestley JA.</text>
