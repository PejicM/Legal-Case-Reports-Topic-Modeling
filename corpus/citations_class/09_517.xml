<tocase>SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/1298.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant filed a Notice of Appeal before this Court on 11 July 2008 which raised three grounds of appeal. On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant represented by Mr Newman of Newman &amp; Associates, sought to abandon the prosecution of any of those grounds and sought leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to rely upon one new ground of appeal. The appellant now contends that the primary judge erred by failing to find jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal as it disregarded: 
 ... much of the appellant's corroborative evidence without ascribing reasons or, alternatively, misapplying the ruling in SZANI v MIMIA [2004] FCA 1298 , Tamberlin J.

In further elaboration of that ground, the appellant says the Tribunal failed to exercise its statutory review function as it applied, in error, an analytical method of first assessing the creditworthiness of the appellant and then, having formed an unfavourable view of the appellant's credibility, concluded, wrongly, that it was entitled to reject the whole of the appellant's corroborative evidence without subjecting that evidence to any assessment or ascribing any reasons for rejecting the evidence.

The Minister opposes the application for leave to amend the notice of appeal. The Notice of Appeal filed on 11 July 2008 is a handwritten notice filed by the appellant under her own hand. She does not appear to have been represented by a lawyer in preparing and filing that document. The appellant was initially represented in the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings by Mr Newman. For reasons which do not need to be repeated here, the hearing of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court was adjourned. Mr Turner of Parish Patience Immigration Lawyers appeared for the appellant on the adjournment application and later acted for her in the conduct of the hearing. Mr Newman now acts for the appellant in the appeal. The appellant as advised by Mr Newman now seeks to agitate the new and only ground of appeal.

Thirdly, guidance in the approach to the utility of corroborative statements can be found in the decision of Tamberlin J in SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298 and the reference in that decision to the reasons of the Full Court in WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188 , which suggest to the Tribunal that where there is a finding by the Tribunal that the evidence of the appellant is fundamentally "discredited", any purportedly corroborative material presented in support of a discredited version of events, may be discarded.

That is not this case. The Tribunal seems to have cited SZANI to illustrate the quoted reference to WAEJ v MIMIA . In that case, the Full Court, Lee, Hill and Marshall JJ at [52] noted the class of case where an appellant's evidence is so discredited that corroborative evidence presented in support of the primary claims "could be discarded without further analysis".</text>

<text>Immediately preceding those observations, the Tribunal contextualised its conclusions concerning the weight and utility of the witness statements by making this observation: 
 In SZANI v MIMIA [2004] S[F]CA 1298 Tamberlin J referred to the decision of WAEJ v MIMIA [2003] FCAFC 188 where the Full Court at page [para] 52 said: 

 
 "On its face the foregoing was a statement by the RRT that the document was not authentic. This was not a case where dishonesty on the part of the appellant had been demonstrated thereby providing support for the further conclusion that the appellant had arranged for the preparation, and tender of, a non authentic, or forged, document which the RRT could disregard. There was no finding by the RRT that the evidence of the appellant was so discredited that any purportedly corroborative material presented on his behalf could be discarded without further analysis (emphasis added by the Full Federal Court)." 
 [There is no emphasis in the quoted passage]

The sequence of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal seems to have been reflected in four steps.

Firstly, the Tribunal has "duly considered" the information from the appellant's witnesses relating to the appellant's engagement with Maoist groups or her husband's engagement with such groups and has duly considered information from these witnesses relating to the "consequences of such connections". Secondly, the nature and degree of the credibility problems the Tribunal has with the evidence of the appellant is such that the witness statements cannot be redemptive of the poisoned well of credibility, that is, the Tribunal cannot give the statements such weight "as can help resolve the appellant's credibility problems in relation to her claims about abuse in Nepal".

Thirdly, guidance in the approach to the utility of corroborative statements can be found in the decision of Tamberlin J in SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298 and the reference in that decision to the reasons of the Full Court in WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188 , which suggest to the Tribunal that where there is a finding by the Tribunal that the evidence of the appellant is fundamentally "discredited", any purportedly corroborative material presented in support of a discredited version of events, may be discarded.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 223</tocase>
<text>In this case, the Tribunal has considered the evidence of the witnesses called by the appellant and has concluded that the content of the evidence does not overcome the Tribunal's conclusions about the reliability of the primary evidence of the appellant. In SZANI v MIMIA , Tamberlin J concluded that the Tribunal's failure to make "any reference" [22] to the documents in question and the Tribunal's failure "to refer to, consider, or give reasons for rejection of the documents" [25] constituted jurisdictional error. In other words, the Tribunal had "ignored" relevant material in the sense contemplated by McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 223 at [82].

In this case, the Tribunal comprehensively examined the primary case first put by the appellant. The Tribunal considered the evidence of the witnesses called by the appellant and reached the conclusions already identified. The Tribunal did not simply ignore the evidence in the sense contemplated in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (supra). The point of principle referred to in the reasoning of the Chief Justice in Applicant S20/2002 remains determinative, whether the particular evidence is a document or a statutory declaration or embraces oral evidence.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/30.html</AustLII>
<text>The proper approach and one in which the resolution of this appeal is to be found is identified by Gleeson CJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [12] to [14]: 
 [12] It was contended that [the relevant passage] shows that the Tribunal member adopted a flawed approach to her evaluation of the evidence, failing to assess the evidence of the applicant/appellant in the light of the corroborating evidence, and giving no weight to the evidence of the corroborating witness for reasons that had nothing to do with the quality of that evidence. The essence of the complaint is that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence as a whole, but first considered, and disbelieved, the evidence of the applicant/appellant, without taking account of the corroboration, and then considered and rejected the corroboration because of the rejection of the evidence of the applicant/appellant. I do not accept that this is a fair criticism of the Tribunal's reasons. In my view, all that the member was saying was that, for reasons already given at length, she found the applicant/appellant's story implausible, and in some important respects unbelievable, and that she also rejected the evidence of the corroborating witness, even though she had no separate reason to doubt his credibility other than the reasons that she had already given for rejecting the claim she was considering. The member could have expressed herself more clearly. It is not necessarily irrational, or illogical, for a finder of fact, who is convinced that a principal witness is fabricating a story, which is considered to be inherently implausible, to reject corroborative evidence, even though there is no separate or independent ground for its rejection, apart from the reasons given for disbelieving the principal witness. 

 
 [13] Upon analysis, the complaint is that the Tribunal member did not have regard to the whole of the evidence before deciding whether she believed the applicant/appellant, and did not properly assess the significance of the evidence of the corroborating witness. I am not persuaded that this criticism is justified. 

 
 [14] Decision-makers commonly express their reasons sequentially; but that does not mean that they decide each factual issue in isolation from the others. Ordinarily they review the whole of the evidence, and consider all issues of fact, before they write anything. Expression of conclusions in a certain sequence does not indicate a failure to consider the evidence as a whole. I do not think that the Tribunal member intended to convey that she made up her mind about the evidence of the applicant/appellant before taking account of the evidence of the witness who was said to corroborate him.

At [49], McHugh and Gummow JJ put the matter in these terms: In a dispute adjudicated by adversarial procedures, it is not unknown for a party's credibility to have been so weakened in cross-examination that the tribunal of fact may well treat what is proffered as corroborative evidence as of no weight because the well has been poisoned beyond redemption. It cannot be irrational for a decision-maker, enjoined by statute to apply inquisitorial processors (as here), to proceed on the footing that no corroboration can undo the consequences for a case put by a party of a conclusion that that case comprises lies by that party. If the critical passage in the reasons of the Tribunal be read as indicated above, the Tribunal is reasoning that, because the appellant cannot be believed, it cannot be satisfied with the alleged corroboration. The appellant's argument in this Court then has to be that it was irrational for the Tribunal to decide that the appellant had lied without, at that earlier stage, weighing the alleged corroborative evidence by the witness in question. That may be a preferable method of going about the task presented by s 430 of the Act. But it is not irrational to focus first upon the case as it was put by the appellant.

In this case, the Tribunal comprehensively examined the primary case first put by the appellant. The Tribunal considered the evidence of the witnesses called by the appellant and reached the conclusions already identified. The Tribunal did not simply ignore the evidence in the sense contemplated in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (supra). The point of principle referred to in the reasoning of the Chief Justice in Applicant S20/2002 remains determinative, whether the particular evidence is a document or a statutory declaration or embraces oral evidence.

In this case, the Tribunal elected to accord the evidence of the witnesses called in support of the appellant's evidence, little weight, having duly considered the evidence. It did so on the footing that the evidence did not assist the Tribunal in resolving its concerns about the reliability and creditworthiness of the appellant. That conclusion was open to the Tribunal on the evidence and the treatment of the evidence is consistent with the principles established in Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 .

Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs is a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.

<tocase>SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 101 ALD 295</tocase>
<text>The appellant says that SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 101 ALD 295 per Madgwick J is authority for the proposition that a failure by the Tribunal to accord separate deliberative reasons for the rejection of the evidence of each witness is a failure to exercise jurisdiction. In that case, Madgwick J concluded that the Tribunal wrongly accorded the evidence of a witness "little weight" for the sole reason that the Tribunal had no opportunity to test the claims made by a witness that her relative had been captured and had heard certain things about the particular applicant's husband. The case also concerned events in Nepal. Having regard to the inquisitorial role of the Tribunal and its statutory function, the rejection of the evidence of a witness as to the statements made to the witness by her relative, on the sole ground identified by the Tribunal, reflected error.</text>
