<tocase>Azed Developments Pty Ltd v Frederick and Co Limited (1994) 12 ACLC 949</tocase>
<text>There is authority for the proposition that the verification required in the affidavit supporting an application to wind the company up under s 459Q is not extensive. The same statutory formula is used in relation to an affidavit verifying the existence of a debt for the purpose of an originating application as is used in relation to the affidavit backing a statutory demand. In the case of an affidavit backing a statutory demand, what is required is formal affirmation on oath that a certain amount of money is due and payable - Azed Developments Pty Ltd v Frederick and Co Limited (1994) 12 ACLC 949; Hamilhall Pty Ltd (In Liq) v AT Phillips Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 173; Carb Royale Pty Ltd v Tonkin (2000) 18 ACLC 803.

In Hamilhall , Branson J discussed the requirements of an affidavit verifying the existence of debt for the purpose of s 459E(3) in relation to a statutory demand. Her Honour noted that in Azed Developments Hayne J of the Supreme Court of Victoria, as he then was, held that s 459E(3) uses the expression 'verify' in the sense of 'a formal affirmation'. Her Honour went on to say (at 174): 
 
 also am of the view that in the context of Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Law , the expression "verify" is used in the sense of "a formal affirmation". The affidavit in this case did contain a formal affirmation that the total of the amount of the debts was due and payable by the respondent.'</text>
