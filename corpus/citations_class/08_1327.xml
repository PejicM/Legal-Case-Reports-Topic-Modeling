<text>35 The appellant further contends that the Tribunal failed to investigate his claims and was actuated by actual bias. Plainly enough, the Tribunal has power to seek information but has no duty to investigate the appellant's claims by conducting its own inquiries to test particular evidence put to the Tribunal or to seek out corroborative or contradictory evidence. It may elect to make inquiries. However, it has no obligation to either exercise the statutory power to make inquiry or to make findings that the particular matter under review does not warrant the exercise of any power to seek information ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [43]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ at [20]). The power to seek information is entirely permissive. Moreover, the failure to exercise a power to obtain further information does not constitute either actual bias or an apprehension of bias. Bias must be clearly demonstrated. The written decision record does not suggest any basis for a contention of actual bias and nor is there any material which suggests to the reasonable observer any basis for apprehended bias ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v JIA [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J at [69]; SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358 per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ at [16]).</text>
