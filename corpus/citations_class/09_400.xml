<text>These reasons which relate to the costs of the proceeding should be read in conjunction with the reasons given today in Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited ACN 111 052 585 v Hardel Investments Pty Limited ACN 083 276 000 [2009] FCA 399. Those proceedings were brought on 28 March 2008 by Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (CBH) and Alpha Asset Group Pty Ltd (Alpha) to wind up Hardel Investments Pty Limited (Hardel) and Avpri Pty Limited (Avpri) (the winding up proceedings). CBH and Alpha relied upon the presumption of insolvency created in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) when a "corporation had failed to comply with a statutory demand served upon it": s 459C(2)(a).

In the winding up proceedings CBH and Alpha claimed that they had served statutory demands upon Hardel and Avpri on 18 December 2007 for debts which were then due and payable together with an affidavit that verified that the debts were then due and payable: s 459E(2) and s 459E(3). They claimed to be entitled to the debts by way of assignment dated 17 December 2007 from Contor Developments Pty Ltd (Contor) and Cobra Services Pty Ltd (Cobra): s 459E(4).

Hardel and Avpri claimed in the winding up proceedings that they did not receive or were not served with any statutory demand prior to the issue of the winding up proceedings on 28 March 2008 or service of the winding up proceedings on 7 April 2008. They also claimed that there was a dispute as to whether any monies were owed to Contor or Cobra. Hardel and Avpri disputed the claim that they were insolvent. Further, they disputed that if there were debts they had been validly assigned to CBH and Alpha.</text>
