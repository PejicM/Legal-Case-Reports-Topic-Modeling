<tocase>Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<text>2 Because the matter was summarily dismissed by the Federal Magistrate, leave to appeal is required. In accordance with the decision in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397, I must consider whether, in all the circumstances, the Federal Magistrate's decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being considered by the Court on appeal and, secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused.

3 After the matter was argued for some time on 6 August 2007, I indicated that I would adjourn the hearing to today for further submissions and that if I was to give leave to appeal, I would also hear and determine the appeal at the same time. The further submissions concerned a particular issue which troubled me during the course of the first hearing. The parties were given an opportunity to consider and make further submissions on that topic. It is referred to below.

4 The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He was born in 1965 and worked as a construction worker in various towns in his province until he came to Australia on 3 November 2005. He applied for a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) shortly after that time, but his application was refused by a delegate of the first respondent on 12 January 2006. That decision was then reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal and affirmed by that Tribunal (the first Tribunal) on 31 March 2006. The first Tribunal hearing and decision was quashed by consent by order of a Federal Magistrate on 21 August 2006 and remitted to the Tribunal for re-hearing by that order.

5 The Tribunal then was differently constituted (the second Tribunal). It conducted a hearing with the applicant on 13 December 2006 and, as I have noted, provided its decision to the applicant on 11 January 2007. It too affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent not to grant to the applicant a protection visa. As I noted earlier, an application to the Federal Magistrates Court to quash the second Tribunal decision was summarily dismissed on 8 May 2007.

6 The applicant's claim to be entitled to a protection visa was based upon him claiming to be a Falun Gong practitioner. At the hearing before the first Tribunal, he said that he had become a member of Falun Gong in about May 1997, and had progressively become more active and more senior in the Falun Gong. He promoted Falun Gong wherever he worked throughout his province. He was a senior member of Falun Gong in his province by 2003. The Falun Gong was banned by the People's Republic of China in 1999. The applicant claimed that in 2003 he was arrested by the authorities and suffered "physical and mental persecution" during the four days of his detention. After his release, he continued to practice Falun Gong secretly but with a great fear of being re-arrested and mistreated by the authorities.</text>

<text>19 There is one further matter which I referred to above, namely the use by the Tribunal of the recording of the hearing before the first Tribunal on 31 March 2006 by the second Tribunal and its use without the applicant having been given a notice under s 424A of the second Tribunal's intended reliance upon that information. I was concerned that the second Tribunal, by acting in that way, had failed to comply with the procedural prescription of s 424A (see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162).</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<text>20 That has been the subject of further submissions by the first respondent. I do not accept one of those submissions. It is put that the fact of inconsistency in evidence provided to the Tribunal is not itself information which activates the obligation under s 424A of the Act. That is of course generally correct. So much was explained in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609. However, I think that principle relates to inconsistencies which emerge in the course of a hearing and does not necessarily relate to inconsistencies which the Tribunal discerns from other information available to it. In my view, the application of that principle depends upon the Court being satisfied that the information provided at the earlier hearing before the first Tribunal was generally information before the Tribunal which did not enliven s 424A at all.</text>

<tocase>SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/107.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 it was decided that upon a case being remitted to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to rely upon the earlier issue of a notice under s 424A and any response to a previously constituted tribunal. The Full Court at [39] explained in the following terms:
 
 In any event, when ss 421 , 422 and 422A refer to ' a particular review ', they identify the review initiated under s 414(1) and culminating in a decision in accordance with s 430 , being the review that a particular person, namely the applicant for review, has initiated in respect of an RRT-Reviewable Decision. The expression does not depend upon the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal. Rather, it refers to the function of the Tribunal to review a decision. Until the Tribunal has made a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s 414 , it has a duty to perform that particular review. An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid. The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made. 
 

In essence, as I read that passage, there is but one review before the Tribunal under s 422 even if the Tribunal is reconstituted by its decision being quashed. The facts of that case are not identical to the present circumstances.</text>

<tocase>SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/190.html</AustLII>
<text>22 However, in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 , Emmett J addressed precisely the circumstances to which I have been referring. In that case, the Tribunal as reconstituted relied on inconsistencies with the then applicant's evidence from the first hearing at the second hearing before that reconstituted Tribunal. His Honour concluded at [16] [17] that doing so did not activate s 424A. That is a decision which is plainly directly on point. I should follow it unless I consider that it is plainly wrong. The applicant has not made a submission to me that it is plainly wrong, and I can readily understand the process of reasoning by which that conclusion was reached. In those circumstances I propose to follow that decision. As I regard that point as a significant and arguable one, I propose to give the applicant leave to appeal in respect of it but for the reasons which I have given I do not accept that the appeal should be allowed on that ground.

23 I have dealt with the other matters raised by the applicant. I have found no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in relation to those matters, nor any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. Accordingly I have come to the conclusion that to the extent to which leave to appeal is to be given, the appeal should be dismissed. The applicant should pay to the first respondent costs of the application.

24 The orders of the Court are:
 
 (1) Leave to the applicant to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate given on 8 May 2007 limited to the issue of whether the Tribunal, in having regard to the information provided by the applicant to the Tribunal as differently constituted at a hearing on 31 March 2006, erred by failing to give to the applicant notice under s 424A(1) of the Migration Act with respect to that information. 


(2) Appeal dismissed.

 
 (3) Applicant to pay to the first respondent costs of the application and of the appeal. 


 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.
