<tocase>Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380</tocase>

<text>That the Federal Court has power to grant an order in the nature of a Mareva order is established by cases such as Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380. The Court being one established by the Parliament pursuant to the Constitution and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1982 (Cth) (Federal Court of Australia Act), the source of power is to be found in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act. It may be described aptly as part of the Court's incidental jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of State Taxation West Australia v Nechold Pty Limited (1995) 30 ATR 69 Jetwest Limited v Haddican (1992) 2 All ER 545</tocase>
<text>An order in the nature of a Mareva injunction in support of a costs order, and even a costs order prior to taxation of costs, is not unprecedented: see Commissioner of State Taxation West Australia v Nechold Pty Limited (1995) 30 ATR 69 at 72(a); see also Jetwest Limited v Haddican (1992) 2 All ER 545 at 548(g).

The evidence read establishes, prima facie, a reasonable basis to suppose that, after 14 August 2009, and at a time when the order made that day had been drawn to his attention, if only at the behest of process servers engaged by the Australian Government Solicitor, Mr Owen has embarked upon a process of liquidating assets and so doing with a view to departing the jurisdiction. Of particular note, in that regard, again prima facie, is the offering for sale of a BMW motor vehicle, registration number "TXT", at what, it seems, is a considerable discount from what one might regard as the usual sale price for a vehicle of that make, age and kilometrage ($157,000 compared with an offering for sale of $129,000). Other items of personal furniture also seem to be being offered for sale via the internet by Mr Owen.

The amount which is sought by way of freezing of assets is up to $150,000. The time for return of an order is given the ex parte nature of the application made today, necessarily short. It will be 1 October 2009 at 9.30am.</text>

<tocase>Thiess Watkins White Construction Limited (in liquidation) v Witan Nominees (1985) Pty Limited (1992) 2 QR 452</tocase>
<text>In this instance, the application is one in respect of a costs order. I am satisfied that the effect of the order as to costs, which I made on 14 August 2009, is indeed one which subjects Mr Owen to a joint and several liability: see in that regard Thiess Watkins White Construction Limited (in liquidation) v Witan Nominees (1985) Pty Limited (1992) 2 QR 452 , and Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Limited No 3 (1979) 42 FLR 213 at 223 and 224.</text>
