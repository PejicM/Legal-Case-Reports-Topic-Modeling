<tocase>Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Samsonidis [2007] FCAFC 54</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/54.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The issues involved in this proceeding require a detailed consideration and analysis of a number of provisions of the TIA Act and the Mutual Assistance Act. The TIA Act was the subject of recent consideration by a Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner, Australian Federal Police v Samsonidis [2007] FCAFC 54. That proceeding involved an earlier application by the applicant in which he sought from the AFP the material supplied to Mr Livanis and the telephone intercepts which formed the basis of Mr Livanis' evidence in Greece. Ultimately the applicant gained access to that material from the court file in Greece.

21 In that case Jessup J explained the relevant structure of the TIA Act in the following passage ([48] and [49]):
 
 "Relevantly to the present case, the purpose of the TIA Act is, as stated in the preamble, "to prohibit the interception of, and other access to, telecommunications except where authorised in special circumstances". Chapter 2 of the TIA Act deals with the matter of the interception of telecommunications. It commences with s 7(1) , which contains a sweeping prohibition. The balance of the chapter is largely concerned with the exceptions to that prohibition. Relevantly to the present matter, there is a pattern in the chapter of providing for an exception, and then limiting the extent to which information obtained as a result of the application of the exception may be used, communicated etc. Thus it may be seen that the area marked out by each exception is tightly defined and guarded. Each seepage of information beyond any such area should rightly be regarded as a failure to achieve the object to which the preamble refers, and which is given practical expression in s 7(1) and the "special circumstances" to which subsequent provisions of Chapter 2 relate. 
 
 In my view, both the nature of the subject matter of, and the detailed provisions in, the TIA Act bespeak the appropriateness of a court showing particular deference to the terms in which the legislature has chosen to express itself. It is those terms which should, save in a very clear case, be treated as embodying legislative purpose. Relevantly to the present matter, I can think of no reason why the purpose of the legislation should be seen as anything other than preventing the communication, use etc of lawfully intercepted information save in the specific circumstances for which the TIA Act itself provides. Section 63 operates subject to Part 2 - 6 , in which words I discern a purpose that only the provisions of that part should qualify the otherwise absolute prohibitions set out in the section itself."

22 It was accepted by the applicant that the interception of the telephone conversations which had occurred and which were the subject of Mr Livanis' evidence in Greece and which were contained in the material sent to Greece was lawful. What was in issue was the lawfulness of the further communication of the intercepted telephone conversations after they were intercepted and recorded.

23 Section 7 of the TIA Act provides:
 
 "(1) A person shall not: 
 
 
 (a) intercept; 
 (b) authorize, suffer or permit another person to intercept; or 
 
 
 
 
 (c) do any act or thing that will enable him or her or another person to intercept; 
 
 
 
 
 a communication passing over a telecommunications system. 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to or in relation to [a number of specified circumstances] ." 
 


 Section 63 of the TIA Act provides:
 
 
 "(1) Subject to this Part, a person shall not, after the commencement of this Part: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) communicate to another person, make use of, or make a record of; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) give in evidence in a proceeding; 
 lawfully intercepted information or information obtained by intercepting a communication in contravention of subsection 7(1). 
 (2) Subject to this Part, a person must not, after the commencement of this subsection: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) communicate interception warrant information to another person; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) make use of interception warrant information; or 
 (c) make a record of interception warrant information; or 
 
 
 
 
 (d) give interception warrant information in evidence in a proceeding." 
 
 


As I have noted earlier, it was accepted by the applicant that the intercepted telephone conversations were "lawfully intercepted information".

24 Section 67(1) of the TIA Act provides:
 
 "An officer or staff member of an agency may, for a permitted purpose, or permitted purposes, in relation to the agency, and for no other purpose, communicate to another person, make use of, or make a record of the following: 
 
 
 (a) lawfully intercepted information other than foreign intelligence information; 
 
 
 (b) interception warrant information." 

The expression "permitted purpose" is defined in s 5 , in relation to an interception agency (which includes an agency and the AFP), an eligible Commonwealth authority or an eligible authority of a State, as meaning, inter alia : 
 
 
 "...a purpose connected with ... an investigation by the agency or eligible authority of a prescribed offence". 


A prescribed offence includes a serious offence, as defined, against the laws of the Commonwealth or a State.

25 Section 74(1) of the TIA Act provides:
 
 "A person may give lawfully intercepted information (other than foreign intelligence information) in evidence in an exempt proceeding."

26 Section 5B(1)(h) of the TIA Act provides that a reference in the Act to an "exempt proceeding" is a reference to, inter alia :
 
 "...a proceeding under section 13 of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 in relation to a criminal matter (within the meaning of that Act) that concerns an offence, against the laws of the foreign country that made the request resulting in the proceeding, that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a period, or maximum period, of at least three years."

27 I turn to relevant provisions of the Mutual Assistance Act. Section 7(1) provides that "Subject to this section, this Act applies to all foreign countries". Relevantly, in relation to one of the submissions raised by the Attorney-General, s 7(3) provides:
 
 "If the regulations provide, in accordance with subsection (2), that this Act applies to a foreign country subject to a mutual assistance treaty, then: 
 
 
 
 (a) if the treaty relates wholly to the provision of assistance in criminal matters this Act applies subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that are necessary to give effect to the treaty in relation to that country; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the treaty relates in part to the provision of assistance in criminal matters this Act applies subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that are necessary to give effect, in relation to that country, to that part of the treaty that relates to the provision of assistance in criminal matters."

28 The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Greece) Regulations 2004 provide in reg 4 that the Mutual Assistance Act:
 
 "... applies to Greece subject to the Treaty between Australia and the Hellenic Republic on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Athens on 4 July 2002, a copy of the English text of which is set out in Schedule 1." 


Article 1 of the Treaty provides:
 
 "The Contracting Parties undertake to afford to each other, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, the widest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or proceedings brought in respect of offences the punishment of which at the time of the request for assistance falls within the jurisdiction of the Requesting State, including the supply of evidence for the proceedings." 


Article 9 of the Treaty provides:
 "PROTECTING CONFIDENTIALITY AND RESTRICTING 
 USE OF EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION 
 
 1. The Requested State, if so requested, shall keep the application for assistance, the contents of a request and its supporting documents, and the fact of granting of such assistance, confidential. If the request cannot be executed without breaching confidentiality, the Requested State shall so inform the Requesting State which shall then determine whether the request should nevertheless be executed. 
 
 2. The Requesting State, if so requested, shall keep confidential information and evidence provided by the Requested State, except to the extent that the evidence and information is needed for the investigation and proceeding described in the request. 
 
 3. The Requesting State shall not use information or evidence obtained, nor anything derived from either, for purposes other than those stated in the request without the prior consent of the Requested State."</text>

<tocase>Brown v Rezitis [1970] HCA 56 ; (1970) 127 CLR 157</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1970/56.html</AustLII>
<text>42 In Brown v Rezitis [1970] HCA 56 ; (1970) 127 CLR 157 the High Court considered the proper construction of s 88F(2) of the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940-1967 (NSW), which provided (at 160):
 
 "The commission, in making an order or award pursuant to subsection one of this section, may make such order as to the payment of money in connection with any contract, arrangement, condition or collateral arrangement declared void, in whole or in part, or varied in whole or in part, as may appear to the commission to be just in the circumstances of the case." 


Barwick CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said at 165:
 
 "Whilst it can be said that the expression 'in connection with' is of wide import, it does emphasize the need for a close connexion between the order made and the contract or arrangement varied or avoided. In my opinion, the power to make an order for the payment of money is at best no more than a power to make such an order as can reasonably be thought to have a real connexion with the making, variation or avoidance of the contract or arrangement which has been varied or avoided."</text>

<tocase>Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280</tocase>
<text>43 In Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 a Full Court of the Federal Court was concerned with the construction of s 164 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) which provided for the payment of a rebate in respect of diesel fuel used for certain purposes. The term "agriculture" was defined as including certain operations "connected with" certain other operations. The Full Court said at 288:
 
 "The words 'connected with' are capable of describing a spectrum of relationships ranging from the direct and immediate to the tenuous and remote. As Sheppard and Burchett JJ observed in Australian National Railways Commission v Collector of Customs (SA) at 378, the meaning of the word 'connection' is wide and imprecise, one of its common meanings being 'relation between things one of which is bound up with, or involved in, another': Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ."</text>

<tocase>Taciak v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 59 FCR 285</tocase>
<text>44 This passage was adopted by Sackville J in Taciak v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 59 FCR 285 at 295. Sackville J continued: 
 
 "The question remains in a particular case what kind of relationship will suffice to establish the connection contemplated by the statute. This requires, to use the language in Pozzolanic , at FCR 289, a 'value judgment about the range of the Act'. 
 
 The value judgment required is more likely to depend on the statutory context than on dictionary definitions."

45 I consider that the same approach should be taken to the meaning of "permitted purpose" in s 67(1) of the TIA Act . It will be a question of fact as to what is the close or real connection but I do not consider that it must be established that the connection must have a purpose of advancing, helping or aiding the Australian investigation. It is a sufficient connection that the purpose of the communication was to assist the Greek authorities in relation to the prosecution of the applicant in Greece, in relation to the same or similar offences which the AFP was investigating in Australia.

46 As I have noted earlier, there is no evidence which enables me to determine the circumstances under which the contents of the intercepted telephone conversations were communicated to Mr Livanis. Accepting for the purpose of the analysis what Mr Livanis said to the Athens Court, it is apparent that by May 2005 the American Drug Enforcement administration and the AFP were investigating a network that was trafficking various kinds of drugs in a number of countries, including Greece and Australia. It is apparent from Mr Livanis' evidence that the American Drug Enforcement administration and the AFP were exchanging information about this network. I am prepared to infer from Mr Livanis' evidence that if indeed it was the AFP that communicated to him the details of the intercepted telephone conversations that such communication had a close and real connection with the AFP's investigations in Australia in relation to contraventions of Australian law by the applicant and others.</text>

<tocase>Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/56.html</AustLII>
<text>52 The applicant submitted that the s 13 proceeding before the Magistrate was a process to which the rules of natural justice, in particular the right to be heard, applied. The applicant relied, in particular, on subs (4) of s 13 (par [29] above). He also submitted that in exercising her discretion under subs (3) of s 13 (par [29] above) whether to take the evidence of a witness in the presence or absence of the applicant, the Magistrate should have given the applicant a hearing in relation to the exercise of that discretion. The applicant relied on Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 in support of his submission. The applicant relied, in particular, upon the reasoning of McHugh J at 472:
 
 "Thus, procedural fairness required as a minimum that the appellant be given the opportunity to put submissions before the A.S.C. relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by the A.S.C."

53 The applicant submitted that the circumstances in Johns v Australian Securities Commission (supra) were the same as existed before the Magistrate. He contended that the statutory scheme in the Mutual Assistance Act did not interfere with his right to be heard. In Johns v Australian Securities Commission (supra), it was held that the delegate of the Australian Securities Commission should have given Mr Johns an opportunity to be heard before she decided to allow the transcripts of Mr Johns' evidence before the Australian Securities Commission to be made available to the Royal Commission. It was clear in that case that the decision to allow the use of the transcripts of Mr Johns' evidence in public hearings were prejudicial to his interests.

54 However, I consider that the statutory scheme under the Mutual Assistance Act is significantly different from the facts and circumstances which underpin the decision in Johns v Australian Securities Commission (supra). As noted earlier in par [28] above, the Mutual Assistance Act applies to Greece with whom Australia has entered into a Mutual Assistance Treaty. Accordingly, the Mutual Assistance Act applies subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that are necessary to give effect to that Treaty. Article 9 of the Treaty (par [28] above) required the relevant Australian officers to keep the request from Greece confidential. Further, the relevant Australian officers were required by Article 9 to keep confidential the evidence provided by Australia. It is apparent from the request for assistance from Greece that it required confidentiality to be applied to its request and to the evidence provided.

55 Such confidentiality could not have been maintained if the Magistrate or the Attorney-General were obliged to inform the applicant of the request or invite his participation in the Mutual Assistance Act s 13 proceeding. In exercising the discretion committed to her in s 13(3) of the Mutual Assistance Act, the Magistrate was obliged to take into account the application of s 7(3) of the Mutual Assistance Act and the confidentiality sought by Greece. Section 13(4) does not take the matter any further as the discretion to allow a person in the position of the applicant to have legal representation at the proceeding was dependent upon the Magistrate deciding whether or not to take evidence in the presence or absence of the applicant.

56 Further, I consider that the nature of the procedure under s 13 of the Mutual Assistance Act to be different in nature from the process considered by the High Court in Johns v Australian Securities Commission (supra). Under that procedure the Magistrate had no discretion in relation to the acceptance or rejection of the evidence.

57 It follows that I do not accept the submission that the applicant was entitled to be given notice of the application to the Magistrate or that he was entitled to be heard in relation to it.

58 I turn to the applicant's submission that the s 13 Mutual Assistance Act procedure undertaken was not lawful or in accordance with the provisions of the Mutual Assistance Act. It is important to note that a proceeding under s 13 of the Mutual Assistance Act in relation to a criminal matter that concerns an offence against the laws of a foreign country that made the request resulting in a proceeding that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a period or maximum period of at least three years is an "exempt proceeding": s 5B(1)(h) of the TIA Act . Section 74(1) of the TIA Act provides that a person may give lawfully intercepted information (other than foreign intelligence information) "in evidence" in an exempt proceeding.</text>
