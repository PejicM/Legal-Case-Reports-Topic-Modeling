<text>9 The Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant's experiences, as he recounted them, did not amount to persecution would, if correct, be a sufficient reason for rejecting the appellant's application. No challenge has been made to the Tribunal's characterisation of the conduct as non-persecutory nor, in my view, would any such challenge have been successful. The conclusion that the One Child Policy does not, of itself, constitute persecution is in accord with the High Court's decision in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 . Similarly there is no evidence to suggest that the Tribunal made any jurisdictional error in failing to be satisfied that the appellant was targeted because of his membership of any particular social group.</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>

<text>10 In VBAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965 , North J considered a decision of the Tribunal for which, in his Honour's view, there were four independent bases, only three of which were challenged on appeal. His Honour rejected the challenges to two of the three. The appellant in VBAP challenged the third basis of the decision on the ground of an alleged breach of s 424A. It was submitted that if such a breach was made out then, following the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, the Tribunal's decision must be set aside. Responding to this submission his Honour said:
 
 " SAAP does not stand for the proposition that if there be a breach of s 424A in relation to one ground upon which a decision is made, and there exists one or more other grounds upon which the decision is not or cannot be impeached, the decision nonetheless falls. SAAP was itself a case in which the only ground relied upon was a ground on which jurisdictional error was established. There was therefore no other basis upon which the decision in that case could be upheld. In the present case there are three other bases upon which the decision may be supported."

11 I agree with his Honour that SAAP does not stand for the proposition asserted. Provided that the other ground or grounds of decision are truly independent of the ground that is tainted by error and are themselves free of jurisdictional error then, in my view, it follows that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to make the decision it made. In this case the Tribunal put aside its doubts about the appellant's credibility and for the purpose of considering if he had suffered persecution in the past, accepted his account. Putting the appellant's claims at their highest however, the Tribunal did not accept that he had suffered persecution in the past or that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in the future. In my view this decision was within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

12 For these reasons the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.
