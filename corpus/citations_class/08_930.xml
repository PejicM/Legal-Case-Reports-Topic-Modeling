<tocase>Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Guina Developments Pty Limited [1996] 2 VR 34</tocase>
<text>4 This sort of question has arisen before, and in particular is the subject of a decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria, Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd [1996] 2 VR 34. The decision of the court was given by Hayne JA. His Honour pointed out at 38 that when the question of disclosure of confidential information to a trade rival arises, it must be remembered that confidential information once received cannot be forgotten, and may be used in a way in which the party disclosing the information never becomes aware.

5 I think that is an important consideration in the present case. I am satisfied that the information in question is genuinely confidential. The evidence in the substantive hearing disclosed there is very close competition in the project homes market. Knowledge to a competitor of costings and margins would be very valuable for the purpose of setting prices.

6 I do not think Barrett are seriously disadvantaged for the purpose of making its election because, as already mentioned, their Chief Financial Officer will have access to the report. If they wish, they could also retain some independent expert with knowledge of this particular industry.

7 I note in particular that Mr Roberts is a person who is involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, and so the more likely to be in a position to take advantage of the information. This is not necessarily a case of any dishonest or improper use of information. As is stressed in Mobil Oil , once information is disclosed it becomes part of the person's stock of knowledge and it is unrealistic to expect that knowledge to be ignored. 

 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.
