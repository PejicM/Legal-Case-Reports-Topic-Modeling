<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>16 Mason CJ set out, in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 , characteristics of decisions to which s 5 applies. In particular, his Honour held that (at 336):
 
&#8226; Reviewable decisions are decisions "which a statute requires or authorises rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision";
 
&#8226; Such decisions have "the character or quality of finality, an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute..."; and
 
&#8226; Acts "done preparatory to the making of a 'decision' are not to be regarded as constituting 'decisions' for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of 'conduct' as well as of a 'decision'."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1904/1.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The principle by which power may be granted by necessary implication is a well established principle of statutory construction: see for example Hudson v Venderheld [1968] HCA 17 ; (1968) 118 CLR 171 at 175; Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 30 ALR 77 at 83; Gerah Imports v Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (1987) 14 ALD 351 at 362 and Collector of Customs v LNC (Wholesale) Pty Ltd (1989) 19 ALD 341 at 345. In D'Emden v Pedder [1904] HCA 1 ; (1904) 1 CLR 91 , Griffith CJ, delivering the judgment of the High Court, described the principle as follows (at 110):
 ...where any power or control is expressly granted, there is included in the grant, to the full extent of the capacity of the grantor, and without special mention, every power and every control the denial of which would render the grant itself ineffective.</text>

<tocase>Gudjala People #2 v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 1167</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1167.html</AustLII>
<text>33 In Gudjala People #2 v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 1167 ( Gudjala People ), in the context of an examination of the Registrar's duty under the Act, Dowsett J commented (at [14]):
 Sub-section 190A(1) required the Delegate to consider the Application. In effect he had to decide whether to accept it for registration pursuant to s 190. Sub-section 190A(5A) provides: 
 
 Before the [NT] Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration, he or she may notify the applicant that the application may be amended under the Federal Court Rules .

34 In my opinion, Item 90(2) similarly imposes upon the Registrar (or his delegate) a requirement to examine any claim satisfying the conditions of Item 90(1) against the requirements of ss 190, 190A, 190B, and 190C in order to decide whether it should be on the Register.

35 On this ground, the applicants argue that, even if the Registrar was required to apply the registration test to the applicants' claim, he was not empowered to remove the claim from the Register other than in circumstances as provided for in s 190 of the Act. The applicants submit that the only power of the Registrar to remove claims from the Register is contained in s 190(4) of the Act, which provides:
 
Entries removed or amended after determination, decision or withdrawal
 (4) If: 
 
 (a) the Registrar is notified under section 189 or 189A of a decision or determination covering a claim; or 
 
 (b) the Registrar is notified by a recognised State/Territory body of a decision or determination covering a claim; or 
 
 (c) the Registrar is notified that an application that contained a claim has been withdrawn; 
 
 the Registrar must, as soon as practicable: 
 
 (d) if the application in question has been withdrawn, dismissed or otherwise finalised--remove the entry on the Register that relates to the claim; or 
 
 (da) if an approved determination of native title is made to the effect that native title exists in relation to an area: 
 
 (i) but no determination has yet been made under section 56; or 
 
 (ii) a determination has been made under section 56 that the native title rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders, but no determination has yet been made under subsection 57(2) of which prescribed body corporate is to perform the functions mentioned in subsection 57(3); 
 
 amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it reflects that fact; or 
 
 (e) in any other case--amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it only relates to the matters in relation to which the application has not been finalised.

54 In Gudjala People (supra), Dowsett J considered the procedural fairness requirements imposed upon the Registrar in considering an application under s 190A in the normal course of events; that is, where a normal application had been made to the Registrar to have an application entered on the Register. In that case, the Registrar's delegate had advised the applicant of some, but not all, deficiencies in its application. The applicant argued that this breached the rules of procedural fairness. His Honour said (at [21]):
 In advising the applicant of the shortcomings in the Application, the Delegate was presumably exercising the power conferred by subs 190A(5A). However, he was not obliged to do so. To extend to the applicant an opportunity to re-formulate the claim before deciding whether or not to accept it for registration was a desirable, but not necessary, course. Even if the Delegate had not advised the applicant of all matters causing concern, that would not have led me to conclude that he was bound to proceed upon the basis that matters not addressed should necessarily be resolved in ways which were favourable to the applicant. The applicant was warned that it must satisfy the requirements of the Act. The Delegate directed attention to his major areas of concern. There is nothing in this point.

55 However, it must also be noted that the matter presently before the Court has a different historical context from that in Gudjala People . Aside from the additional requirements imposed on the Registrar by Item 90, it is important to note that the applicants' claim was already entered onto the Register, thereby conferring upon the applicants the various rights that come with registration. The applicants have enjoyed those rights for some 11 years. That context informs the requirement in Item 90(4)(c) for the Registrar to advise the applicant that he is considering the claim, and to provide the applicant with a "reasonable opportunity" to provide any further information or other things to the Registrar in his consideration of the claim.

56 The correspondence between the delegate and the applicants relevant to this issue is set out at [6]-[11] above. The relevant chronology is as follows:
 
&#8226; The Registrar wrote to the applicants on 24 April 2007 informing them that their claim was to be considered against the registration test; why it was to be considered; that they could provide further information; how their claim could be amended; and that the Registrar wished to undertake the test as soon as possible due to its age.
 
&#8226; The case manager wrote to the applicants on 14 May to tell them that the claim would be tested in September 2007, and that any amendments or additional information needed to be filed by 17 August 2007.
 
&#8226; The case manager wrote a reminder letter to the applicants on 7 August 2007, noting that the claim was still to be tested by 30 September 2007, and that information had to be filed by 17 August 2007.
 
&#8226; The applicants wrote an email to the case manager on 17 August 2007 requesting an extension of time to amend the claim and provide further information.
 
&#8226; The delegate refused to change the time for the testing of the claim, but gave the applicants until 24 August 2007 to provide further information. This was communicated to the applicants on 20 August 2007.

57 The applicants' arguments rest in large part upon the fact that they were, at the time, not legally represented. This was the case until after the delegate made the decision on the extension of time, and, the applicants argue, should have been apparent. The applicants argue that, without such representation, they did not know what amendments might have to be made to the application if it was to pass the registration test, and were therefore reliant on assistance from the National Native Title Tribunal.

63 It is worthwhile noting that the applicants have not claimed as a ground of their application that the delegate failed to take into account relevant considerations in making the decision. Dowsett J in Gudjala People commented on an application which confused errors in the decision-making process and breaches of procedural fairness, observing that (at [13]) "errors alone will not generally amount to a denial of procedural fairness." In this instance, supposedly relevant considerations may have some bearing on the question of procedural fairness, but only to the extent that they inform the "circumstances of the case".

64 The question for the Court on this occasion is therefore whether the delegate "acted fairly" and gave the applicants a "reasonable opportunity" to amend their application and provide further materials to the Registrar. In considering this question, I do not agree with the contention of the applicants that the obligation upon the Registrar to consider claims for registration within a year has any application. It seems to me that, by imposing upon the Registrar a nominal deadline of one year within which to consider claims, Item 90(2) clearly aims to have claims for registration tested and decisions made as quickly as the resources of the Tribunal, the applicants and relevant representative bodies will allow. It follows that that time period is not, in my opinion, relevant to any consideration of whether an applicant has been given a reasonable opportunity to submit materials to the Registrar.

65 The Registrar first put the applicants on notice of the fact their claim would be tested on 24 April 2007. That letter informed the applicants that they would have the opportunity to amend their claim, however it was not clear from the letter the kind or extent of changes that would need to be made, or the time frame within which the changes would have to be made.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/17.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The principle by which power may be granted by necessary implication is a well established principle of statutory construction: see for example Hudson v Venderheld [1968] HCA 17 ; (1968) 118 CLR 171 at 175; Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 30 ALR 77 at 83; Gerah Imports v Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (1987) 14 ALD 351 at 362 and Collector of Customs v LNC (Wholesale) Pty Ltd (1989) 19 ALD 341 at 345.

<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>48 The circumstances which give rise to the duty of procedural fairness were set out by Mason J (as he then was) in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 584:
 The law has now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights, interests and legitimate expectations, subject only to the clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention.

49 His Honour went on to note that (at 584-585):
 Where the decision in question is one for which provision is made by statute, the application and content of the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly depends to a large extent on the construction of the statute ... the expression "procedural fairness" more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case.</text>

<tocase>McGibbon v Linkenbagh (1996) 41 ALD 219</tocase>
<text>17 Kiefel J, then of the Federal Court, considered the same question with regard to the refusal of a disciplinary review committee to grant an adjournment to the applicant in McGibbon v Linkenbagh (1996) 41 ALD 219. Her Honour stated (at 224) that the committee's refusal was 
 ...not a "decision" of which s 3(1) and s 5(1) AD(JR) Act speaks, since it is neither final nor determinative of a substantive matter. Although one is tempted to conclude that in a sense it has some operative effect and carries with it findings adverse to Mr McGibbon, it is to be seen as merely procedural and intermediate and as such is to be viewed as conduct engaged in as a step towards and for the purpose of the later "decision".

18 In my view, the decision in the present case made on 20 August 2007 regarding an extension of time falls into the same category. The granting of an extension was not required by or provided for under the Act, nor was it a final determination of a substantive matter. Rather, it appears to be a procedural and intermediate step. In my opinion, the conduct of the delegate would not be reviewable under s 5, but might be reviewable under s 6 of the ADJR Act. However, as the submissions on behalf of the Attorney-General acknowledge, the decision of 28 September is within the scope of s 5; the grounds of review relied upon by the applicants are the same in relation to both decisions; and the remedies sought by the applicants relate to the 28 September decision. It is therefore sufficient for the present proceedings that the court has jurisdiction to review the 28 September decision. It is not necessary to express a concluded view on the character of the 20 August decision.

19 I also note, however, that the application filed by the applicants was filed outside of the 28 day time period within which an applicant may lodge an application for review (s 11(3) of the ADJR Act). In such circumstances, the Court has a discretion, pursuant to s 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act, to allow an application to be lodged "within such further time as the court concerned (whether before or after the expiration of the prescribed period) allows."

20 The applicants submit that the application should be allowed to be heard, notwithstanding that it was filed outside of the prescribed period, on the basis that the applicant was not legally represented at the time of the delegate's decision and the application was filed only a very short time (some 10 days) after the end of the prescribed period.

21 On behalf of the Attorney-General, it was submitted that the Court, in the exercise of its discretion to allow further time pursuant to s 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act, may take into account that the applicants had available to them "another more specific avenue for review by this Court, under s 190D" of the Act as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act 2007 (Cth). Section 190D(2) of the Act, before those amendments, provided that if the Registrar did not accept a claim for registration, the applicant could apply to the Federal Court for a review of the Registrar's decision. Such an application for review under s 190D(2) of the Act could have been made by the applicants within 42 days of the notification of the Registrar's decision: O 78 r 12(ii) of the Federal Court Rules .</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>50 The importance of the construction of the relevant statutory scheme has recently been reiterated by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592. There, the Court stated that (at 598):
 It has long been established that the statutory framework within which a decision-maker exercises statutory power is of critical importance when considering what procedural fairness requires. It is also clear that the particular content to be given to the requirement to accord procedural fairness will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

51 In the context of this matter, it is s 190A of the Act and Item 90 of Sch 2 to the Amending Act to which the Court must have particular regard. Section 190A(3) of the Act sets out the material to which the Registrar must have regard when considering a claim under s 190A. That section provides:
 
 
 (3) In considering a claim under this section, the Registrar must have regard to: 
 
(a) information contained in the application and in any other documents provided by the applicant; and (b) any information obtained by the Registrar as a result of any searches conducted by the Registrar of registers of interests in relation to land or waters maintained by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and (c) to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so in the circumstances--any information supplied by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, that, in the Registrar's opinion, is relevant to whether any one or more of the conditions set out in section 190B or 190C are satisfied in relation to the claim; 
 
 and may have regard to such other information as he or she considers appropriate.

52 Section 190A(5A) allows, but does not require, the Registrar, before he or she has decided whether or not to accept the claim for registration, to notify an applicant that the application may be amended under the Federal Court Rules .</text>

<tocase>Wakaman People v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 1251</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1251.html</AustLII>
<text>39 In her oral submissions, Ms Bowskill drew particular attention to the duties imposed on the Registrar by the Act with respect to the establishment and maintenance of the Register. Those duties were considered by Justice Kiefel in Wakaman People v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 1251 at [8] :
 The Register is a public document, to be available for inspection (s 187(1)). The provisions of the NTA concerning its maintenance suggest that it is intended to reflect the current state of affairs with respect to claims. Section 186(1)(ca) requires the date upon which the claim is entered on the Register to be included in it. The Registrar is required 'as soon as practicable' to include in the Register details of any claim accepted for registration under s 190A (s 190(1)(a)) and must likewise amend the Register where there is an amended application which complies with the Act's requirements and remove any entry relating to the claim where it does not: s 190(2) and (3). The Registrar must also take prompt action to remove entries where a claim has been withdrawn, dismissed or finalised: s 190(4). The need for the Register to reflect the current state of claims is confirmed by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (in connexion with s 190(2)).

40 Paragraph 29.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum noted by her Honour states:
 ... the purpose of the registration test is to ensure that only claims which have merit are registered in the Register of Native Title Claims.

41 It is clear from the above that Pt 7 of the Act imposes particular duties upon the Registrar to maintain the Register, to keep it up to date, and to ensure that the only entries on the Register are those which have met the requirements of the statute. Prior to the Amending Act, the applicants' claim fell into that category. The effect of Item 90 of Sch 2 to the Amending Act was to require the applicants' claim to meet the criteria in the registration test if it was still to meet the requirements of the Act. In my judgment, if the Registrar decided that the applicants' claim did not so meet the Act's criteria, then he was under an obligation to update the Register accordingly. There is no express power in the Registrar to remove a claim under those circumstances, but such power exists, in my judgment, by necessary implication.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1995/1484.html</AustLII>
<text>14 The particular jurisdictional basis upon which the applicants' claim was made is not articulated in the application for review, although it has been addressed by both the applicants and the Attorney-General in their respective submissions. The applicant submits that both decisions of the delegate were decisions "of an administrative character" made "under an enactment" such as to bring them within the scope of s 5 of the ADJR Act. In addition and in the alternative, the applicant submits (relying upon Western Australia and the Northern Territory of Australia v Patricia Lane, Native Title Registrar [1995] FCA 1484) that s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) could confer jurisdiction on the Court, as the Registrar is an officer of the Commonwealth, and it is within the original jurisdiction of the Court to review the decisions of such officers.

15 The Attorney-General does not dispute that the decision of the delegate made on 28 September 2007 in relation to the claim for registration falls within the scope of the ADJR Act. However, the Attorney-General submits that the earlier decision of the delegate, made on 20 August 2007 in relation to the extension of time, was not of an administrative character, nor was it made "under an enactment".</text>
