<text>10 Significantly, in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [8] Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed:
 
 'The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge ... to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits ....'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/17.html</AustLII>
<text>7 An appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is authorised by s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). It is an appeal by way of rehearing on the evidence adduced before the Federal Magistrate ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507). In the circumstances it is appropriate for me to review that evidence which includes both the audio tapes of the Tribunal hearing and the transcript of that hearing. Having done so, I should set aside the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court only if persuaded that his Honour's conclusion is wrong ( Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 211 at [46]). However, it is not necessary for me to be satisfied that his Honour failed to apply the proper test. If, after giving appropriate weight to the view of the Federal Magistrate, I were persuaded that the conduct of the Tribunal member gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, the appeal would succeed; I would have identified error in the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>

<tocase>NADH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264</tocase>
<text>4 The reasons for judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate record that his Honour read a transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal and also listened to an audio tape of the entire hearing. His Honour, as the appellants accept, correctly identified the test for apprehended bias by reference to the reasons for judgment of Allsop J, with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed, in NADH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2005) 214 ALR 264. The critical passages from the reasons for judgment of Allsop J are set out in [9] below. As those passages make clear, the test for present purposes is whether the relevant circumstances are such that a fair-minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the decision-maker might not have brought an impartial mind to bear on the decision.

5 At various points in his reasons for judgment the Federal Magistrate asked himself questions in terms that, as the appellants submit, suggest that he departed from the proper test. For example, at one point his Honour asked:
 
 'At the end of the hearing with [sc. would] the fair-minded observer think that the applicant was before a Tribunal whose mind was open to persuasion?' 
 

At another he observed:
 
 'I am not left with a sense that the fair-minded lay observer would take from these passages a view that the Tribunal's mind was not open to persuasion.'

6 After carefully reviewing the manner in which the Tribunal member conducted the hearing, the Federal Magistrate, while critical of the Tribunal member, concluded that her conduct did not give rise 'to the possibility of apprehended bias'.

9 The critical passages from the reasons for judgment of Allsop J in NADH v MIMIA referred to above are the following:
 
 'The general test for apprehended bias is whether the relevant circumstances are such that a fair-minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the decision-maker might not bring or have brought an impartial mind to bear on the decision ... 
 
 To identify the obligation of the tribunal, and the content of the necessary apprehension in the circumstances here, a number of matters need be recognised. First, while it is necessary to demonstrate that the circumstances are such as would give rise to the relevant apprehension, the apprehension itself is not as to the fact or likelihood of a lack of impartiality, but of a possibility (real and not remote) thereof ... 
 
 Secondly, the identity, nature and function of the decision-maker are important influences on the content of the requirement to conduct the relevant task with the observance of procedural fairness by not being tainted by the appearance of disqualifying bias ... 
 
 Third, the place of a decision-maker such as the tribunal here should be recognised as different from a judge in open court ... The tribunal does not administer public justice. The elements which affect the public confidence in the adjudication of disputes by an independent and impartial arm of government (in the broad sense) and which may be seen to inform what might be said to be freestanding norms of conduct and behaviour by judges conducting public hearings are not necessarily as easily transposable as strict obligations of administrative decision-makers acting in private. The tribunal here must investigate the facts for itself unaided by counsel presenting the parties' cases, to the degree and extent it thinks appropriate. The tribunal which has to reach a state of satisfaction may want to test and probe a recounted history. It may have particular matters troubling it for resolution, which require questioning and expressions of doubt which are entirely appropriate, but which if undertaken or said by a judge in open court in adversary litigation might give rise to an apprehension of a lack of impartiality. 
 
 At least in the absence of the identification of some prejudice or interest in the tribunal, for a complaint of apprehended bias based on the conduct of the tribunal in its procedure and the dealing with material before it in its reasons to be meaningful, it must carry with it an assertion of the apprehension of a possibility of predisposition. That is, the predisposition of the tribunal towards a result, other than a result reached by an evaluation of the material before it in a fair way with a mind that was open to persuasion in favour of the person in question. Unless that be demonstrated, it is hard to see how a decision-maker has failed to conform to standards of procedural fairness. Such an approach accords with the need for neutral and fair decision-making, without imposing on decision-makers in an administrative context the burden of behaving at all times as would a judge in public in the deployment of judicial power.'

<tocase>Steadman-Byrne v Amjad [2007] EWCA Civ 625</tocase>
<text>11 Sedley LJ, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, recently said in Steadman-Byrne v Amjad [2007] EWCA Civ 625 at [10] in the context of an allegation of appearance of bias in a judge:
 
 'Bias in the present context has to mean the premature formation of a concluded view adverse to one party. We put it in this way because it is well recognised not only that a judge may and commonly will begin forming views about the evidence as it goes along, but that he or she may legitimately give assistance to the parties by telling them what is presently in the judge's mind. This may properly include ... letting the parties know before reaching the defence case that the judge did not think much of the claimant's evidence.' 
 

As Allsop J observed in NADH v MIMIA (see [9] above) a Tribunal member may have an even greater need than a judge to test and probe the evidence of a witness.

12 Consistently with what I told counsel during the hearing of this appeal, I have read the entire transcript of the Tribunal hearing but, generally speaking, I have only listened to those portions of the audio recording upon which the appellants placed reliance. As counsel for the appellants accepted, these portions provide the best illustrations of the appellants' case.

13 In doing so I have borne in mind the critical importance to most applicants for review of a decision to refuse to grant them a protection visa of any hearing by the Tribunal. I have also borne in mind the importance of Tribunal members dealing sensitively and patiently with applicants who come before them, particularly when they are giving evidence of distressing events of a personal nature. On the other hand I have also had regard to the need for a Tribunal member to test evidence and, as appropriate, probe for weaknesses in an applicant's case. Additionally it is necessary to acknowledge that Tribunal members are not only subject to ordinary human frailties, but are also under pressure to conduct hearings expeditiously.</text>
