<text>16 The refusal of the application by the Federal Magistrates Court is said by the Appellant to be " not fair " . But it is not the task of the Federal Magistrate to determine that which he subjectively may think is either " fair " or " not fair ". His task is the confined task conferred by s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). It is considered important to constantly recall that even the task of judicial review, unconstrained by notions of jurisdictional error, is not concerned with correcting " administrative injustice ": Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1. Brennan J there observed at 35 6:
 The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone. The consequence is that the scope of judicial review must be defined not in terms of the protection of individual interests but in terms of the extent of power and the legality of its exercise. In Australia, the modern development and expansion of the law of judicial review of administrative action have been achieved by an increasingly sophisticated exposition of implied limitations on the extent or the exercise of statutory power, but those limitations are not calculated to secure judicial scrutiny of the merits of a particular case. 
What is required by procedural fairness is a fair hearing, not a fair outcome: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 at [25] , [2006] HCA 63 ; 228 CLR 152 at 160. " The relevant question ", Jacobson J has observed, " is about the Tribunal's processes, not its actual decision ": SZLVN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1301 at [18] .</text>

<text>11 Even if an argument as to bias had not been raised before the Federal Magistrate, leave to now raise such an argument on appeal would have been refused: cf SZGWN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 238 at [120] , 103 ALD 144 at 174 per Gilmour J. Leave may be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so. But it is well accepted that a " reasonable apprehension " of bias must be " firmly established ": Re JRL, Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352 per Mason J. The circumstances more relevant to an application in respect to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal, where proceedings are heard in private, has been addressed by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ as follows in Re Refugee Review Tribunal, Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 , 179 ALR 425: 
 [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of "a fair-minded lay observer" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private. [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof.</text>

<text>13 But such is not the present case. The materials now before the Court have been reviewed and provide no discernible basis upon which any suggestion as to bias on the part of the Tribunal could be sustained. The reasons for decision expose a careful account of the evidence being presented and a careful attempt to ensure that such inconsistencies as were apparent in the now Appellant's evidence were brought to his attention. Two hearings were afforded to the now Appellant. Moreover, it is seldom the case that a reasonable apprehension of bias can be established merely by reference to the reasons for decision: SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358 at [16] per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ.

14 In the present appeal it would not be in the interests of justice to now allow an argument as to bias on the part of the Tribunal to be advanced. It is an argument without substance.

15 The basis upon which bias was otherwise being advanced was not further explained.</text>

<tocase>SZLVI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1206</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/1206.html</AustLII>
<text>3 On 29 August 2008, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking to review the decision of the Tribunal: SZLVI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1206. The Appellant now appeals to this Court.

4 The Appellant appeared before this Court unrepresented, although he did have the benefit of an interpreter. He first appeared on 26 November 2008. But on that occasion it emerged -- perhaps surprisingly -- that he had not read either the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court or his Notice of Appeal . The Notice of Appeal was apparently prepared by a migration agent. Serious questions necessarily arise in circumstances where a migration agent has -- at least on the account given by the present Appellant -- neither informed him as to why he lost before the Federal Magistrates Court, nor the grounds upon which the decision of the Federal Magistrate may be challenged on appeal. How an appellant can make an informed decision and give instructions as to whether or not he wishes to appeal in the absence of at least minimal explanation being provided to him, remained unexplained. A decision to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court cannot be entrusted to migration agents alone and without instructions. The difficulties confronting unrepresented litigants who do not speak English are not to be compounded by a failure to keep them informed or explain to them the steps being taken in their own applications for a Protection Visa. Such fundamental difficulties are noted so that the Respondent Minister or his Department may take such steps as they consider appropriate.

5 For the purposes of the present appeal, the difficulties initially confronting the Appellant were addressed by adjourning the appeal until 28 November 2008 in order to ensure that the Federal Magistrate's decision and the Notice of Appeal could be translated. On 28 November 2008, the Appellant again appeared with an interpreter and made oral submissions.

18 The final Ground of Appeal must also be rejected. The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate discloses that he reviewed the reasons for decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the procedure it had followed. He referred to the inconsistencies as found by the Tribunal in the now Appellant's account and considered the terms of the letter written to the now Appellant explaining what were perceived to be inconsistencies and the significance that the Tribunal may have attached to those inconsistencies. Indeed, the Federal Magistrate stated in conclusion that he considered there was " an obligation on the Court to independently consider whether argument based on material before the Court leads to a jurisdictional error ": [2008] FMCA 1206 at [24] . That question was answered in the negative.

19 No reason emerges from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate to conclude that he did not " reasonably " consider the application before him.

20 No reference may be found expressly in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate which refers to the risk to which the now Appellant would be exposed if he were to be returned to China. In the absence of any submissions being advanced in respect to that risk, and there apparently were none, the failure to address a submission or an aspect of the evidence does not expose error. Moreover, the Federal Magistrate referred to the findings of the Tribunal as to credibility. That was a sufficient basis in itself for a rejection of the application by the Federal Magistrates Court. The reference to " they " in the final Ground of Appeal is unclear. If it is a reference to the Tribunal, the Tribunal did in fact refer to the risk asserted by the now Appellant if he was to return to China; if it is a reference to the Federal Magistrates Court, the failure to refer to the risk exposes no appellable error.</text>

<text>12 Although instances in which a bias allegation has succeeded as against the Tribunal fortunately may be rare, instances do occur where a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out: eg, VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 , 131 FCR 102. Kenny J there relevantly concluded:
 [82] ... The vice in this case was that, by the Member's conduct during the hearing, a fair-minded observer might well infer that there was nothing the applicant could give by way of evidence or submit by way of argument that might change her mind about his claim -- that he had fabricated his account. Virtually from the beginning of the hearing until its end, the Member expressed her disbelief in his truthfulness. Whether expressly, by implication, or by her tone of voice, she made it clear that she did not believe him and the account he gave. As well as repeated expressions of disbelief, there were her constant adverse comments on his evidence; and numerous displays of irritation, impatience, frustration and, sometimes, sarcasm. The applicant was regularly interrupted. Much of the Member's questioning of the applicant appeared calculated to undermine his case, rather than to facilitate a non-partisan investigation into the facts.</text>
