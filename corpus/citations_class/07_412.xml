<text>1 On 23 February 2007 I delivered reasons substantially upholding Mr Guest's contentions in this matter. I directed that counsel bring in minutes of proposed orders to give effect to the reasons: Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193.

2 Differences have arisen between the parties as to the appropriate calculation of interest for which I have held Mr Guest is entitled to deductions. Written submissions have been filed.

3 Two issues arise: the method of calculation of interest and the application of sale of fruit proceeds. Depending on which approach is correct as to each issue, Mr Guest may have been under no liability at all to Rural Finance as at 31 March 1991 in which case no deductions will be allowable for the tax years in question (1998 2001 inclusive). Alternatively, there may be a liability which will result in a deduction for substantially less than the amounts claimed.</text>
