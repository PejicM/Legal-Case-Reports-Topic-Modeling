<text>Undoubtedly, if the Tribunal misconstrued any of the criteria prescribed by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") or the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ("the Regulations ") or in effect failed to ask the question which the Act or Regulations required to be asked, jurisdictional error will occur. The relevant principles are conveniently set out by Kenny J in Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558.</text>

<text>It appears clear that s 424A is an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with and excludes other common law principles: s 422B and see SZBDF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 ; (2005) 148 FCR 302 and Lay Lat v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 61 at [60] [70].</text>

<text>In my view the Tribunal did not deny any procedural fairness to the appellant. The appellant was given the opportunity to provide the Tribunal with material in support of his claims. At the hearing the appellant provided the Tribunal with a number of newspaper clippings and other material relating to political killings and election-related violence. Insofar as the country information cited by the Tribunal was relied upon, in my view the Tribunal was not required to provide the appellant with an opportunity to comment on its assessment of that country information by reason of the operation of s 424A(3)(a) of the Act and I refer to a number of cases including Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 at 598-600; VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 82 at [12] [14] and [21]; WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330 at [42] [46]; QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92 at [20] [30]; and VJAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178 , at [15] to [16].</text>

<tocase>VBAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/212.html</AustLII>
<text>I can find no basis for considering that the Tribunal misconstrued its task or failed to address the correct inquiry. The appellant submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood the meaning of persecution and "serious harm" for the purposes of the Refugees Convention and s 91R of the Act in finding that the harm that the appellants experienced in the past did not amount to serious harm. In my view the Tribunal did not misunderstand the meaning of either of those terms within the meaning of the Refugees Convention or the Act . It was open at all times to the Tribunal to find that the threats and harassment alleged by the appellant did not amount to serious harm: see generally VBAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212 at [17] [28].

The Tribunal simply did not accept the appellant's claims concerning the incidents following the elections in April 2004. It was not satisfied that he was ever harmed as he alleged. The appellant also submitted the Tribunal failed to consider whether the facts as it found them to have occurred led to the conclusion that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugees Convention reason. However, it is clear to me that the Tribunal did consider the findings of fact and addressed the proper question whether the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution. The appellant also submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood what follows from its finding that the persecution did not have an "official" quality. But, as was noted by the Federal Magistrate, this submission did not appear to relate to any findings of the Tribunal in the present case.

The appellant submitted that the Tribunal acted in breach of the rules of natural justice by failing to give him an opportunity to respond to adverse material comprising the country information in relation to the 2004 elections cited in the Tribunal's reasons and referred to above. The appellant says that had he been notified of this material he would have provided the Tribunal with information about election-related violence in Sri Lanka.</text>
