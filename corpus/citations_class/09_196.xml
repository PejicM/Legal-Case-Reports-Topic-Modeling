<tocase>Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93</tocase>
<text>The appellation "Calderbank offer" has its origin in the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93 at 106. In essence, a Calderbank offer is one which is made in a proceeding before judgment on the basis of it being without prejudice save as to costs and in which an offer for settlement or resolution of the proceeding is made. The right is reserved to refer to the offer if any issue arises as to costs once judgment is delivered. A court can take the offer into account in determining what costs order should be made notwithstanding that the payment into court procedure provided in the court's rules has not been followed. If the party to whom the offer is made does not obtain a more favourable result than the offer made and it is established that in the circumstances of the case that party ought to have accepted the offer, then costs will be awarded on the same basis as if there had been a payment into Court prior to judgment and judgment for a lesser amount had been obtained.</text>

<tocase>Jacomb v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical &amp; Services Union [2004] FCA 1600</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/1600.html</AustLII>
<text>The refusal or rejection of a Calderbank offer, of itself, does not automatically mean, or give rise to a presumption, that the Court should make an order for costs on either a party/party basis or (depending on the circumstances) an indemnity basis where the result is less favourable to the offeree than the offer. It must be established that it was unreasonable in all the circumstances for the offeree to reject the offer : Jacomb v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical &amp; Services Union [2004] FCA 1600 at [6] ; Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2) (2005) 13 VR 435 at 440.

That question gives rise to a threshold issue were the offers genuine offers of compromise? The plaintiff submitted that they were not genuine offers of compromise, but rather were "invitations to capitulate by discontinuing the proceedings on a basis that each party bear its own costs". There is support in a number of cases for the view that an offer by a defendant that a plaintiff discontinue the proceeding on the basis of each party bearing its own costs is not a genuine offer for the purpose of considering the effect of a Calderbank offer on a question of costs: McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 at [9] - [11] ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 at [59] - [64] ; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] ; Jacomb v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical &amp; Services Union (supra) at [7]; Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In Liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] . (The reasoning in Herning v GWS Machinery Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 375 and Townsend v Townsend (No 2) [2001] NSWCA 145 does not support the proposition that an offer by a defendant that the proceeding be discontinued with no order as to costs cannot be regarded as a genuine offer to compromise.)</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/536.html</AustLII>
<text>Pursuant to s 43(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the Court has a broad general discretion in determining how, in what manner, and whether, costs should be borne and paid as a result of the conclusion of any proceeding. The usual order for costs is that costs follow the event and are paid on a party/party basis unless there are special circumstances which warrant the making of some other order. However, it has long been established that the Court may award costs on a solicitor/client or indemnity basis where the particular circumstances of the case warrant the Court departing from the usual order of party/party costs: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225.

In Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (supra), Sheppard J set out some of the circumstances which he considered had been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion to make an order for payment of costs not on the usual basis of party/party costs but on the basis of indemnity costs. Those circumstances included "an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise".</text>

<text>The refusal or rejection of a Calderbank offer, of itself, does not automatically mean, or give rise to a presumption, that the Court should make an order for costs on either a party/party basis or (depending on the circumstances) an indemnity basis where the result is less favourable to the offeree than the offer.

In Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2) (supra), the Victorian Court of Appeal accepted the proposition that the rejection of a Calderbank offer should only lead to the making of a special costs order, other than a party/party costs order, where the rejection of the offer was unreasonable.

The Court of Appeal, at 442, set out a non-exhaustive list of matters to which a court should have regard in considering a submission that the rejection of a Calderbank offer was unreasonable: 
 "(a) the stage of the proceeding at which the offer was received; 
 (b) the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer; 
 (c) the extent of the compromise offered; 
 (d) the offeree's prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the offer; 
 (e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed; 
 (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree's rejecting it."

In the present circumstances, the relevant question to ask and answer is whether the rejection of the offers by the plaintiff was unreasonable having regard to the relevant circumstances: Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2) (supra) at 441.</text>

<tocase>Hobartville Stud Pty Ltd v Union Insurance Co Ltd (1991) 25 NSWLR 358</tocase>
<text>I do not agree with the proposition that an invitation to a plaintiff to discontinue proceedings with no order as to costs is not a genuine attempt to resolve the proceeding by way of compromise for the purposes of considering the consequences of an offer made in a Calderbank letter. In an appropriate case, the giving up by a defendant of the opportunity to recover from the plaintiff the costs it has incurred in defending a proceeding can constitute consideration for a compromise which is real, particularly where the costs incurred have been substantial. The reasoning of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Leichardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 supports this proposition. The cases to which I have referred in the previous paragraph do not appear to have taken into account the fact that such an offer involves the defendant giving up the opportunity to recover its costs from the plaintiff. If the proceeding was pursued to judgment in favour of the defendant, then the defendant would be able to obtain an order to recover its costs from the plaintiff. The renunciation of that opportunity, in my opinion, clothes the offer with the cloak of a genuine compromise of substance. As Giles J said in Hobartville Stud Pty Ltd v Union Insurance Co Ltd (1991) 25 NSWLR 358 at 368: 
 "Compromise connotes that a party gives something away".</text>
