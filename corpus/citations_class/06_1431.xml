<tocase>Colbeam Palmer Ltd v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/50.html</AustLII>
<text>33 Section 126 of the Act allows an applicant, at its option, to claim damages or an account of profit. The nature of the choice was explained by Windeyer J in Colbeam Palmer Ltd v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25 (at 32): 
 
 'The plaintiff whose mark has been infringed can choose between damages or an account of profits. He cannot have both. They are alternative remedies. 
 
 The distinction between an account of profits and damages is that by the former the infringer is required to give up his ill-gotten gains to the party whose rights he has infringed: by the latter he is required to compensate the party wronged for the loss he has suffered.' 


That observation clearly proceeded on the basis that the damages recoverable for infringement of a trade mark are compensatory.</text>

<tocase>Gerber Garment Technology Inc v Lectra Systems Ltd [1995] RPC 383</tocase>
<text>34 In relation to the assessment of damages for the infringement of patents, Jacob J set out a number of principles in Gerber Garment Technology Inc v Lectra Systems Ltd [1995] RPC 383 at 393 and following: 
1. Damages are compensatory only.
 
 2. The burden of proof lies on the plaintiff but damages are to be assessed liberally.
 3. Where a patentee has licensed his patent, the damages are the lost royalty.
 4. It is irrelevant that the defendant could have competed lawfully.
 5. Where the patentee has exploited his patent by manufacture and sale, he can claim: 
 (a) lost profit on sales by the defendant he would have made otherwise; 
 
 
 (b) lost profit on his own sales to the extent that he was forced, by the infringement, to reduce his own price; and 
 (c) a reasonable royalty on sales by the defendant which he would not have made. 
 


In the 13 th Edition of Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2001) p 18-144, the learned authors set out those principles and suggest that they are also applicable to trade mark infringement. Accepting the compensatory character of damages awarded under s 126 and the like formulation in s 122 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), I accept that the principles enunciated by Jacob J are relevant to the assessment of compensatory damages for trade mark infringement under the Australian Act.

35 In this case the applicants also seek exemplary damages. There is, however, no provision in the Trade Marks Act for exemplary damages to be awarded. Section 126 of the Act may be contrasted with s 115 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). That makes provision for the recovery of damages under s 115(2) in terms similar to those used in s 126. Section 115 also makes provision for "additional damages" in s 115(4). There is no equivalent to that provision in the Trade Marks Act . The head of additional damages for infringement of copyright requires consideration of "flagrancy of the infringement" and "benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant" as well as other factors relevant to both aggravated and exemplary damages as understood at common law. No authority was cited for the proposition that exemplary damages are available for trade mark infringement. Nevertheless it was submitted that, having regard to the purpose of the Act, the absence of any express limitation in the language used in s 126 and the availability of exemplary damages in passing off actions, exemplary damages should be available under that provision.

42 I do not consider that it is a consequence of the principle enunciated in Adidas or Enzed that, where a basis for quantification of loss is entirely within the knowledge of the applicant and no evidence is adduced as to the quantum, the Court should make its own uninformed assessment of a royalty or licence fee that the applicant might have foregone by reason of loss of sales. Speculation and even guesswork may have a role to play where the relevant evidence is inaccessible to the applicant. That is particularly so where the inadequacy of the evidence is caused by a recalcitrant or uncooperative respondent or one who has kept no adequate records of dealings. In so saying, of course, it must be recognised that an applicant may apply to the Court for an order for the examination of the respondent in aid of the assessment of damages. Relevant to this issue, and incidentally that of exemplary damages, is the observation of Lord Wilberforce in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1976] RPC 197 at 212, quoted by Jacob J in Lectra (at 393): 
 
 'First the plaintiff's (sic) have the burden of proving their loss: second, that the defendants being wrongdoers, damages should be liberally assessed but the object is to compensate the plaintiffs and not punish the defendants.'</text>

<tocase>Musca v Astle Corporation Pty Ltd (1988) 80 ALR 251</tocase>
<text>36 A review of the authorities relating to the availability and principles underlying the award of exemplary damages in tort was set out in Musca v Astle Corporation Pty Ltd (1988) 80 ALR 251. Although not necessarily to be regarded as an anomalous or illogical remedy, it is nevertheless an unusual one. In my opinion where a statute creates a remedy by way of damages for breach of a proprietary right, then absent specific provision or necessary implication, it should not be read as extending that remedy to exemplary damages. In this case a statutory formulation is used which has been construed as compensatory. It contrasts notably with the express provision in the Copyright Act for "additional damages". Exemplary damages are not available under s 126.

37 The applicants claim their compensatory damages under the following heads: 
1. Loss of sales through eBay.
2. Loss through devaluation of their product. 
3. Loss through damage to their reputations.

38 Under the heading of 'Loss of sales" the applicants referred to the numbers of DVD titles relevant to each applicant sold by Mr Hasluck on eBay. They also referred to the number of DVDs delivered up by him relevant to each applicant. As a matter of inference, having regard to the marks on the delivered up DVDs and Mr Hasluck's acknowledgment of his infringing conduct in relation to sales over eBay, each of the DVDs sold through the eBay bearing the title belonging to a particular applicant would have borne the trade mark of that applicant.</text>

<tocase>Nominet UK v Diverse Internet Pty Ltd (No 2) (2005) IPR 131</tocase>
<text>40 The Court was not assisted by any evidence as to the licence fees or royalties charged by the applicants in respect of the particular titles at the time of their sale or at all. The reference to "sell through" price in Mr Kerin's evidence did not provide any basis for the estimation of either a licence fee or a royalty. In this connection the evidence necessary to quantify the loss was in the hands of the applicants. Its absence may be contrasted with the extensive evidence of a notional royalty offered by the applicant in Nominet UK v Diverse Internet Pty Ltd (No 2) (2005) 68 IPR 131. In that case damages were assessed, in relation to the infringing use of copyright material "mined" from a domain name register, by the calculation of a "reasonable royalty", that sum which would be agreed between a willing licensor and a willing licensee in a hypothetical arms length negotiation. The approach has been held to offer guidance in other cases of copyright infringement: LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 24. Nominet was a more difficult case than the present because the copyright owner was a not-for-profit company which was not engaged in the business of licensing its copyright.</text>

<tocase>Adidas-Salomon AT v Turner (2003) 58 IPR 67</tocase>
<text>41 The applicants made reference in their submissions to Adidas-Salomon AT v Turner [2003] 58 IPR 67. Goldberg J commented upon the limited evidence available to him upon which to base the assessment of damages for the infringement of trade mark rights. The difficulty arose from the limited information which could be extracted from the respondent as to the sale of infringing items. His Honour however said (at 67): 
 
 '... notwithstanding the difficulty facing me on the assessment of damages the Court has to do the best it can on available material.' 
 

He quoted from the judgment of the Full Court in Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 where the Court said (at 183):
 
 'The principle is clear. If the court finds damage has occurred it must do its best to quantify the loss even if a degree of speculation and guess work is involved. Furthermore, if actual damage is suffered, the award must be for more than nominal damages. We should add that we can see no reason why this principle should not apply in cases under the Trade Practices Act as well as in cases at common law. We emphasize, however, that the principle applies only when the court finds that loss or damage has occurred. It is not enough for a plaintiff merely to show wrongful conduct by the defendant.'

42 I do not consider that it is a consequence of the principle enunciated in Adidas or Enzed that, where a basis for quantification of loss is entirely within the knowledge of the applicant and no evidence is adduced as to the quantum, the Court should make its own uninformed assessment of a royalty or licence fee that the applicant might have foregone by reason of loss of sales. Speculation and even guesswork may have a role to play where the relevant evidence is inaccessible to the applicant.

 'First the plaintiff's (sic) have the burden of proving their loss: second, that the defendants being wrongdoers, damages should be liberally assessed but the object is to compensate the plaintiffs and not punish the defendants.'

49 In Adidas Salomon , Goldberg J also considered the devaluation of trade marked products. His Honour found that the respondent had offered infringing items for sale over the internet. Their availability for sale was made apparent to the public and such persons as would go his website. As in the case of the Sony Play Stations, he found it unlikely that the purchasers of the items or persons looking at the website would reasonably have believed that the items were genuine Adidas items. He said (at 68 [7]): 
 
 'I am prepared to draw an inference that, in general terms, a buyer would be satisfied that in order to obtain a genuine Adidas garment, one would need to buy it through more official channels and that it would have been apparent by reference to price that these were not genuine Adidas items. I am satisfied that the fact that infringing items were available in the circumstances in which the respondent was offering them for sale tended to diminish the reputation of the genuine product sold by Adidas and tended to devalue the products that Adidas offers for sale.' 
 

Like Emmett J his Honour found it very difficult to place any specific figure on the loss that would have been suffered by Adidas by way of additional devaluation of its products by reason of the conduct of the respondent. He was satisfied that such damages would not be nominal having regard to the extensive audience available to a website such as the respondent's website.

52 The applicants also claim compensation for damage to their reputation. It is submitted on their behalf that the Court should be willing to draw the inference, as did Goldberg J in Adidas Salomon , that the infringing items were offered for sale in circumstances which tended to diminish the reputation of the genuine products. The applicants, it was said, have a reputation for producing good quality DVDs. Those sold by Mr Hasluck were of poor quality.

53 The applicants submitted that the feedback on Mr Hasluck's eBay sales record, revealed that some people did not know they were buying infringing copies and complained. It was submitted that it is not until a person plays the DVD and sees its poor quality that it becomes apparent that it is an infringing copy. On that basis it was argued that Mr Hasluck's conduct had damaged each applicant's reputation. Those applicants who had greater numbers of DVD titles sold were likely to have suffered greater damage to reputation.

54 In the eBay member profile for the period from 6 March 2005 to 5 May 2005 the positive feedback score was 89.6%. 206 members left a positive comment, 24 left a negative comment. It is evident that there were some members who, thinking they were buying the genuine item, discovered it was illegal and complained about that fact. It is difficult to see how that kind of discovery would reflect back upon the reputation of the applicants. As to those who made positive comments, again it is difficult to see how their positive experience would reflect upon the reputation of the applicants. This is conceptually distinct from the question of devaluation of the product arising from the lower price at which it was available on the internet. I would add that the feedback comments were not correlated to the purchasers of particular DVDs and therefore not correlated to any applicant's product.</text>

48 There is a question about precisely what is meant by the concept of 'devaluation of product". In Sony Computer Entertainment , Emmett J was concerned with the sale of counterfeit Sony Play Station games. His Honour said (at [9] and [10]):
 
 'I am ... satisfied that there would be some damage to the applicants by reason of counterfeit games being made available for sale. The respondent offered games for sale by advertisements in the Trading Post newspaper. Sales took place by people calling at a private home. In the circumstances I do not consider that purchasers of the counterfeit games would reasonably have believed that the games were genuine Sony products. I would draw the inference that, generally, a buyer would be satisfied that, in order to obtain a genuine Sony game, one would need to buy it through ordinary channels. 
 
 Nevertheless, the fact that Sony games are available in the circumstances in which the respondent was selling them tends to devalue the product that the applicants offer for sale. Ten per cent of the sale value is a very substantial proportion. It is very difficult to place any figure on the loss that would have been suffered by Sony by way of additional devaluation of its products by reason of the conduct of the respondent.' 


His Honour concluded that the loss occasioned by the respondent would be very small. However it would not be nominal. He considered it appropriate to order the respondent to pay damages which he assessed at $3,000.

49 In Adidas Salomon , Goldberg J also considered the devaluation of trade marked products. His Honour found that the respondent had offered infringing items for sale over the internet. Their availability for sale was made apparent to the public and such persons as would go his website. As in the case of the Sony Play Stations, he found it unlikely that the purchasers of the items or persons looking at the website would reasonably have believed that the items were genuine Adidas items. He said (at 68 [7]): 
 
 'I am prepared to draw an inference that, in general terms, a buyer would be satisfied that in order to obtain a genuine Adidas garment, one would need to buy it through more official channels and that it would have been apparent by reference to price that these were not genuine Adidas items.

43 In the case of a patentee who has licensed his patent, the damages are the lost royalty. The same principle applies to trade marks which are licensed. Jacob J said (at 394):
 
 'The court must be satisfied that the royalty represents a true bargain.' 
 

Again he cited Lord Wilberforce in General Tire (at 394):
 
 'Before a "going rate" of royalty can be taken as the basis on which an infringer should be held liable, it must be shown that the circumstances in which the going rate was paid are the same, or at least comparable with those in which the patentee and the infringer are assumed to strike their bargain.'</text>

<tocase>AG Spalding &amp; Bros v AW Gamage Ltd [1918] 35 RPC 101</tocase>
<text>46 I would add the cautionary observation in Kerly at 18-146:
 
 'It is important to note that in assessing damages for lost sales on a compensatory basis, it will be necessary for the court to determine what proportion of the defendant's customers have been confused. The claimant is not entitled to damages for sales to persons who have not been misled, since he has suffered no loss in respect of them, and, arguably, no actionable wrong has been committed in respect of sales to them. If he were to recover damages in relation to such persons, he would be over-compensated. This principle distinguishes passing-off and trade mark infringement from other intellectual property proceedings such as those for patent infringement, where all the defendant's activities of a given kind infringe.' 
 

See AG Spalding &amp; Bros v AW Gamage Ltd [1918] 35 RPC 101 and Draper v Trist and Tristbestos Brake Linings, Ld [1939] 56 RPC 429. In the latter case, which concerned passing off by Trade Name and get up of goods, the Master of the Rolls, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR, said (at 437):
 
 
 '... it has been said more than once - and indeed it is obvious that, taking the sales of deceptive articles, the Court is not entitled to assume that every one of those sales would have been obtained by the Plaintiff. For obvious reasons that is an assumption which would be quite unwarranted. The unwarrantable nature of such an assumption is further strengthened, of course, where there are differences in price, differences in quality and so forth, because it is not legitimate to assume that a person who bought the Defendants' article at a lower price, if it was sold at a lower price, would necessarily have bought the Plaintiff's article at a higher price, even if he was deceived into thinking that the Defendants' article was the Plaintiff's. That is a consideration which must be borne in mind.'</text>

<tocase>Alexander &amp; Co v Henry &amp; Co [1895] 12 RPC 360</tocase>
<text>51 It is difficult to see a rational basis upon which the applicants' products are devalued except to the extent that the availability of the cheap pirate DVDs has a potential competitive impact upon the price at which the applicants' DVDs can be sold and therefore the royalties that they can charge. Accepting that there is some devaluation of that kind, I consider it almost incapable of estimation not simply as a matter of difficulty, but as a matter of principle. By that I mean that, absent evidence of some competitive response by the applicants, the error in assessing changes in the value of a product by reference to infringement may be greater than the value shift itself. A case in which there was evidence of a lowering of the trade mark owner's prices which may have been partially affected by the infringer's conduct was Alexander &amp; Co v Henry &amp; Co [1895] 12 RPC 360. There is, of course, no such evidence here. Nevertheless, in deference to previous authority and the injunction to take a "liberal approach" to the assessment of compensatory damages in this area, I would allow a figure of $1,000 to each applicant for product devaluation. I have not differentiated between applicants on the basis of the volume of sales of products over the eBay. It seems to me that if there is any principle underlying the devaluation of product it is predominantly the availability of the cheaper product, rather than the particular number that might have been sold in a given period. Having said that, I accept that the volume of sales was not trivial for the period between March and May 2005.</text>

<text>57 I will also allow pre-judgment interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 1 May 2005 to 1 November 2006. This amounts to $135 in respect of each of the applicants. The interest amount is awarded under s 51A(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and follows the usual practice of adopting rates of interest applied in the relevant State Supreme Court: GEC Marconi v BHP (2003) 201 ALR 55; Walker v Citigroup [2005] FCA 1866. As to costs, having regard to the applicants' lack of success on the question of exemplary damages and the unnecessarily protracted presentation of evidence in this case, I will order, against the second respondent, half of the costs of the assessment of damages. That is to be taxed as one set.

The interest amount is awarded under s 51A(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and follows the usual practice of adopting rates of interest applied in the relevant State Supreme Court: GEC Marconi v BHP (2003) 201 ALR 55; Walker v Citigroup [2005] FCA 1866. As to costs, having regard to the applicants' lack of success on the question of exemplary damages and the unnecessarily protracted presentation of evidence in this case, I will order, against the second respondent, half of the costs of the assessment of damages. That is to be taxed as one set. 
 I certify that the preceding fifty-seven (57) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
