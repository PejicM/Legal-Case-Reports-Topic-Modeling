<tocase>Grant v John Grant [1950] HCA 54 ; (1950) 82 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1950/54.html</AustLII>
<text>52 Counsel for Rosalind seek an order under s 175(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) correcting the share register of the relevant companies to reflect her entitlement to shareholdings in them. Rosalind has standing to apply for such an order as "a person aggrieved", given that her interests are not correctly stated in the current share register. It is appropriate and just in this case to order a correction of the register. Rosalind has established an equity to be recorded on the Dalness Pty Ltd share register by virtue of the Deeds of Appointment made by Donald on 3 December 1986: see, Grant v John Grant [1950] HCA 54 ; (1950) 82 CLR 1. In relation to Rocklands Pty Ltd, the Family Rearrangement entered into in 1988 gave Rosalind a right to be registered as the owner of one A class share immediately and the B class share upon payment. Payment was eventually made by July 2005. Under s 175(3) the notice of correction must be lodged with ASIC and it is appropriate to so order.</text>

<tocase>In re Sussex Brick Company [1904] 1 Ch 598</tocase>
<text>54 Under s 234 of the Act, a person can apply for an order under s 233 if that person is a member of the company. Counsel for the defendants submit that Rosalind lacks such standing but concede that if the Court makes an order nunc pro tunc , finding her to be entitled retrospectively to be a member of the companies at a time prior to 10 October 2005, when the application was filed, the standing issue disappears. It is appropriate in this case to make an order nunc pro tunc as equity so requires. There has been unnecessary delay in registering Rosalind as a member of the companies and there is no apparent injustice to third parties if such an order were made: see, In re Sussex Brick Company [1904] 1 Ch 598. Rosalind was entitled to be recognised as a member of Rocklands Pty Ltd from at least 1 July 2005 on the payment of the price of those B Class shares and of shares in Dalness Pty Ltd from the time of the grant of probate on her father's estate on 21 June 2004. She was entitled to her A Class share in Rocklands Pty Ltd as from 7 October 1988.

55 Under s 233 of the Act, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this matter discussed above, it may be appropriate that the companies are wound up given the unlikelihood that Neil and Rosalind are capable of working together in the best interest of the companies. However, counsel do not oppose the Court deferring the question of winding up until after the parties (primarily Rosalind and Neil) can attempt to resolve outstanding issues concerning the companies between them, before the Court is required to consider the appointment of liquidators. An order under s 233 will be made, if necessary, because the failure of the other shareholders in the companies to recognise Rosalind's stake in them has denied her the opportunity to play a part in the functioning of those companies and is in that sense "oppressive".

56 Counsel for the defendants submit that the Court should invite counsel to provide, within a relatively short period, minutes of orders which the parties contend should be made to give effect to the Court's reasons. That request is a reasonable one. However, the preparation of those orders should reflect the Court's views on the plaintiff's application that:
 
 &#8226; Dalness Pty Ltd should correct its register of members to record the plaintiff as a member of the company and a beneficial holder of 22,625 ordinary shares, and the beneficial owner jointly with Neil of 1 ordinary share, and requiring Neil and Deidre to lodge a notice of correction with ASIC.
 &#8226; Rocklands Pty Ltd should correct its register of members to record the plaintiff as a member and the beneficial owner of 1 A Class share and the beneficial owner of 25 B Class shares, and requiring Neil and Deidre to lodge notices of correction with ASIC.
 &#8226; Otherwise the application under s 233 of the Corporations Act seeking winding up of the companies and other orders as set out in paragraph 5 of the application should be adjourned to a date to be fixed by the Court, in consultation with the parties.
 &#8226; The defendants' cross-claim should be dismissed as no such agreements as alleged were entered into by Rosalind.
 &#8226; As the plaintiff has wholly succeeded on the issues dealt with to date, the defendants should pay her costs of the application.</text>

<tocase>Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1954/72.html</AustLII>
<text>45 It is unnecessary to traverse the details of what occurred thereafter. The defendants contest Rosalind's entitlement to shares in the two companies based on what they contend was her agreement to give them up. According to the cross-claim, that agreement was constituted by the 18 January 2001 and 8 December 2001 agreements. The 18 January 2001 agreement was no more than an agreement to negotiate. So much was conceded from the bar table by the defendants' senior counsel in his final submissions. In closing, it was submitted by counsel for the defendants that the outcome of the 8 December 2001 meeting constituted a binding agreement on the authority of Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353. In that case, the High Court constituted by Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ said at 360:
 
 Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three classes. It may be one in which the parties have reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect. 

 In such a case, as described in Masters , there is a binding contract. What is critical, in the current circumstances, is to establish the intentions of the parties viewed objectively to be bound immediately at the 8 December 2001 meeting. No such evidence of any probative value was advanced in that regard. The evidence of Rosalind and the actions of both Neil and Mr McKenzie demonstrate a contrary intention. There was no agreement on 8 December 2001 other than to consider the proposals contained in Mr McKenzie's paper. Rosalind did not commit herself to those proposals at that meeting. She had not ever had the opportunity to fully consider them before it occurred. Mr McKenzie's letter to Mr Sproal on 10 December 2001 was based on a false premise that Rosalind had agreed to the terms of his proposal on the previous Saturday. The better view of the evidence, considered as a whole, is that she had not done so.

46 Having regard to the foregoing there is no reason why Rosalind should not be recognised as the holder of shares in the two companies. In fact, in 1990, the relevant register of shares showed Rosalind registered as the owner of one A Class share in Rocklands Pty Ltd. The evidence offered no explanation for this change or for its subsequent removal. Neil, under cross-examination, agreed that in 1990, Rosalind was beneficially entitled to have the A Class share registered in her name. Neil also agreed with the proposition put to him that:
 
 As to Rocklands, the correct situation which should be reflected in the share register concerning the A class shares is one share to you and one share to your sister.

47 On 25 July 2005, Neil wrote to Rosalind saying that he would arrange the "transfer of shares in both companies" to her as soon as she paid certain amounts allegedly owing to her father's estate and to the partnership upon receipt of advice as to when she would pay.</text>

<tocase>Morgan v 45 Flers Avenue Pty Ltd (1986) 5 ACLC 222</tocase>
<text>53 Rosalind's application is also made under s 233 of the Act. Section 233 is found in Pt 2F.1 of the Act and entitled "oppressive conduct of affairs". Section 232 allows the Court to make an order under s 233 if the conduct of the company's affairs or an omission by the company is "oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member or members....". The failure of the other shareholders in the companies to recognise Rosalind's stake in them has denied her the opportunity to play a part in the functioning of those companies and is in that sense "oppressive": see, Wayde v NSW Rugby League Ltd [1985] HCA 68 ; (1985) 180 CLR 459; Morgan v 45 Flers Avenue Pty Ltd (1986) 5 ACLC 222. Further, it is evident that the conduct of Neil as a director of both companies has been oppressive where he unfairly used that position to deny Rosalind her right to be registered on account of purported debts owed to his father's estate and the partnership.</text>
