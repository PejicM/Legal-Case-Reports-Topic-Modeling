<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/609.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 , Finkelstein J said at [7] that the proper approach is that access should be allowed unless the interests of justice require a different course. His Honour went on to say that there is a strong presumption in favour of allowing any member of the public who wishes to do so to inspect any document or thing that is put into evidence.

34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission. It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] . But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused.

40 ACCC v ABB is the only Australian authority to which I have referred in which access was granted to a non-party who was not a media organisation. The applicant was a non-party who sought access to a statement of agreed facts and joint submissions of the parties in proceedings brought by the Commission against a company and its executives for civil penalties for contravention of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1 974 (Cth): see ACCC v ABB at [1]. The applicant sought access to those documents to determine whether it should bring an action to recover losses suffered as a consequence of the admitted breaches.

41 The extension of the principle of open justice to those circumstances is perfectly understandable. The Commission's proceedings were brought in the public interest and parties affected by the contravention ought to be given access to determine whether a private action for damages caused by the contravention would be justified. The documents sought were confined in nature. The applicant did not seek to trawl willy-nilly through the court file.

42 The question of whether access should be granted to Merlin arises in different circumstances. The authorities to which I have referred indicate, in my view, that the discretion is one to be exercised in the interests of justice, having regard to all the circumstances.

43 Where leave is sought to inspect documents that have not been read in open court, or at least tendered in evidence and considered by the judge as evidence or submission, the rule in my opinion is that leave will ordinarily be refused to inspect that material. This approach is consistent with that suggested by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio Network Pty Ltd v ABA [2002] FCA 1408 at [21] ; cf. ACCC v ABB at [6].

44 It is true, as Finkelstein J said in ACCC v ABB at [6] that O 46 r 6(3) does not distinguish between documents that have been admitted into evidence and those which have not. But as Santow J observed in eisa Ltd v Brady [2000] NSWSC 929 , there is a risk of serious injustice if untested allegations can be published to the world at large: cited in Macquarie Radio Network at [21].

64 Here, the application is not made in furtherance of the principle of open justice. It uses, as a springboard, the corollary to which Moore-Bick J referred in Dian , namely that persons present during a court hearing may learn of information they can use to their advantage. But in truth it goes further because it seeks "access to justice" based upon the modern approach to commercial litigation with its emphasis upon creation, and preservation of large volumes of written material, much of which is not read out in open court.

<text>73 This seems to me to be consistent with the approach taken by Cowdroy J in Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168 at [26] . His Honour granted access to affidavits admitted into evidence, but access was otherwise refused. Access was granted to annexures but they form part of the affidavit and are to be distinguished from exhibits in the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Dawson Nominees v Multiplex (2007) 64 ACSR 53</tocase>
<text>74 Dr Bell pointed to [64] [66] of the judgment of Wilcox J in which his Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Johnsen, stating that it contained evidence of routine downloading of ARIA Top 50 and Top 100 recordings. Dr Bell referred me to the decision of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [30] to support the proposition that access to the exhibits to the affidavits ought to be granted. But the observations of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex are not a charter for access to documents by non-parties. His Honour's remarks were made in the context of existing proceedings where the documents had potential relevance to the issues in the litigation.</text>

<tocase>Dian AO v Davis Frankel &amp; Mead (a firm) [2005] 1 All ER 1074</tocase>
<text>49 In Dian AO v Davis Frankel &amp; Mead (a firm) [2005] 1 All ER 1074, a non-party applied to the court for permission to inspect and copy the court file in proceedings which had been concluded by compromise some eight years earlier. The non-party made the application in the hope of obtaining information which would be of use to it in litigation which was on foot in the British Virgin Islands.

50 Moore-Bick J granted access to affidavits and pleadings notwithstanding the substantial delay. Of course, he did so under the relevant English rules of court but a number of his observations are in my view applicable to the regime established under O 46 r 6.

51 First, the principle of open justice is primarily concerned with monitoring the decision-making process as it takes place, not with reviewing the process long after the event: Dian at [30].

52 Second, an application for permission to use the court file as a source of potentially useful information to assist in other litigation does not engage the principle of open justice. Nevertheless, one consequence of the application of the principle of open justice is that persons who are present in Court may obtain access to information that they may be able to use to their advantage in other litigation. But this is merely a consequence of doing justice in public. It is not one of its primary objects: Dian at [31].

53 Third, the rules do not contemplate permission to inspect the file as a whole. The documents which an applicant wishes to inspect must be identified with reasonable precision: Dian at [32].

59 In his speech in Home Office v Harman , Lord Diplock referred at 303 to the inevitable side effect of administering justice in open court and the corollary that persons present in court may use documents that are read out in court for purposes other than the attainment of justice in the particular case. The observations of Moore-Bick J in Dian at [31] are to the same effect.

64 Here, the application is not made in furtherance of the principle of open justice. It uses, as a springboard, the corollary to which Moore-Bick J referred in Dian , namely that persons present during a court hearing may learn of information they can use to their advantage. But in truth it goes further because it seeks "access to justice" based upon the modern approach to commercial litigation with its emphasis upon creation, and preservation of large volumes of written material, much of which is not read out in open court. 
Finkelstein J referred to this in ACCC v ABB at [4] [5].

75 So too in Dian , the documents were sought for the purpose of obtaining information of potential use in litigation that was already on foot. It was not to determine whether a case may be launched, and if so, by whom.

76 Mr Cobden submitted that I ought not to grant access to Ms Ball's affidavits. It is true that Ms Ball made copies of sound recordings in circumstances in which she obtained the protection of s 104 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). However, I do not think that the grant of access to those parts of her affidavit which were read in evidence would put her in breach of that provision, or in breach of the implied undertakings pursuant to which she obtained and used the material.</text>

<text>45 In Dobson v Hastings [1992] Ch 394 at 401-402, Sir Donald Nicholls VC considered that the Rules of the Supreme Court indicate that save when permitted under the rules, documents on the court file are not intended to be inspected or copied. He said that:
 
 ... a court file is not a publicly available register. It is a file maintained by the court for the proper conduct of the proceedings. Access to that file is restricted. Non-parties have a right of access to the extent, but only to the extent, provided in the rules.</text>

<tocase>GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd v Liverpool and London Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 984</tocase>
<text>47 In GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd v Liverpool and London Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 984 at 995, Potter LJ said that when evidence, including court bundles, are read out in court they "enter the public domain" and a member of the press or public may quote from the document:
 
 ... but the right of access to it for the purposes of further use or information depends upon that person's ability to obtain a copy of the document from one of the parties or by other lawful means.

48 Nevertheless, the approach taken by his Lordship was not as narrow as this passage might suggest. FAI General Insurance Co Ltd sought access to counsel's written submissions in the proceedings to identify documents that might be the subject of a subpoena in parallel litigation. His Lordship at 996 regarded this as a legitimate purpose for the grant of access to the documents.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/403.html</AustLII>
<text>77 I will not allow access to the digital music files discovered by the Sharman respondents, or to the digital files seized from the universities. They are not part of the Court file and they do not appear to have been admitted into evidence. Particular caution is required before granting access to this class of documents: Re Bond; Ex parte Hongkong Bank [1999] FCA 403 at [4] (per Hely J).

78 The "Applicant's' Main Tender Bundle" may have been admitted into evidence but it was a compilation of exhibits and is therefore covered by what I said above about the property in those documents.

79 The same approach is applicable to the appeal books. Access will be obtained by Merlin to the body of the affidavits but the balance of the appeal books (other than pleadings and other documents otherwise available under O 46 r 6(2)) merely reproduce exhibits and transcript.</text>

<tocase>Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 225 ALR 256 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1394.html</AustLII>
<text>6 The application raises an important question of principle which does not seem to have been dealt with in any earlier authority. Although Dr Bell invoked the principle of open justice, referred to in cases such as Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 225 ALR 256 , ultimately he put the application on the footing that it was for access to justice.

7 The purpose for which Merlin seeks access to the documents is to obtain information concerning possible infringements of its members' copyright in the same period as was covered by the Kazaa proceedings. Merlin seeks to obtain evidence of copyright infringement by the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings, by the same conduct as was in issue in those proceedings.

8 The essential issue which arises is whether a non-party ought to be given access to a defunct court file in order to gather evidence for a case it (or, more accurately, some of its members) may wish to bring against the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings in circumstances in which the non-party cannot satisfy the requirements for an order for preliminary discovery under O 15A of the Federal Court Rules .

31 This is hardly surprising because the principle which informs the exercise of the power is that of open justice, the underlying rationale being the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against abuse of power of the courts: see Seven Network at [21]ff; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) (2006) 232 ALR 398 at [16]ff; Rich v Harrington (2007) 99 ALD 297 at [17]ff.

33 Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the abovementioned statements of principle by Finkelstein J: Seven Network at [25]. However, I do not think it follows that the principle is as broad as was submitted by Dr Bell SC for Merlin. Dr Bell's submission was that, at least with respect to documents which have been admitted into evidence, exceptional circumstances are required for an application under O 46 r 6(3) to be refused.

34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission. It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] . But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused.

35 As Sackville J observed in Seven Network at [24], O 46 r 6 does not confer a right on a non-party to obtain access to documents admitted into evidence. Leave from the Court is required. His Honour referred with approval to the statement made by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512 at [29] that open justice is a principle, not a "freestanding right".

36 The guiding principle seems to me to be as stated by Sackville J in Seven Network at [27]. His Honour there said that, unless the interests of justice require otherwise, the Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence.

37 Sackville J went on at [27] to make the important point that in each application the Court will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case. A convenient "touchstone" will be whether the documents have been admitted into evidence. Access to that material:
 
 ... can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate, the court's determination of the issues arising in the proceedings : see Seven Network at [27].

38 This was the view taken by French J in Richstar at [18] where his Honour agreed with the observations of Sackville J in Seven Network to which I have referred in the two preceding paragraphs of my judgment. So too did Branson J in Rich v Harrington at [23]. Her Honour said that this approach recognises that the discretion under O 46 r 6 must be exercised having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.

46 It seems to me that these observations are equally applicable to the scheme established under O 46 r 6, as construed in authorities such as Seven Network.

63 Although Sackville J said in Seven Network at [27] that a convenient "touchstone" for the grant of access is whether the material has been admitted into evidence, the effect of his Honour's judgment is that this is a general rule which will serve the interests of open justice; but all the circumstances must be considered.</text>
