<tocase>AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The rationale for the exercise of the contempt power is "to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the Court's orders will be enforced": AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 107.

There is "a public interest in the exercise of the contempt power in cases of disobedience to an order": Mudginberri Station [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 107.

The law recognises a distinction between civil and criminal contempts. A civil contempt usually involves disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking. On the other hand, a criminal contempt is committed where there is contempt in the face of the court or an interference with the administration of justice.

In Mudginberri Station [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said: 
 When the defendant's disobedience is casual it may readily appear that the primary purpose of exercising the power is to vindicate the plaintiffs' rights. On the other hand, when the disobedience is accompanied by public defiance it may as readily be seen that the primary purpose of exercising the power is the vindication of the court's authority. But the classification in terms of primary purpose is a more complex and artificial undertaking when the punishment is for wilful disobedience unaccompanied by defiance. There is, accordingly, much to be said for the view that all contempts should be punished as if they are quasi criminal in character, notwithstanding the adoption of the contrary view by some members of this Court in the decisions to which we have already referred.

A civil contempt may be classed as a criminal contempt if there has been a contumacious defiance of the Court's order or an undertaking given to the Court: Mudginberri Station [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108.

The applicant contends that the respondent's conduct is contumacious and in deliberate defiance of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking. In those circumstances, it was put that the respondent's conduct must be characterised as criminal contempt because "it occurs in circumstances where the conduct amounted to public defiance, involves a public injury and this calls into play a penal disciplinary jurisdiction to deal with criminal contempt": Mudginberri Station [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108.

In discharging the onus of proof, the applicant must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had knowledge of the order or undertaking and voluntarily did an act or omitted to do an act in breach of that order or undertaking. A party must comply strictly with an order that requires the party to do something or to refrain from doing something. The course of the trial

Dr Toben was represented by counsel. I adopted the procedure of having the charges read over to Dr Toben. He pleaded not guilty to each of the 28 charges.

I should address the question of contumacy because it is important in classifying the contempt and in considering any penalty to determine whether the disobedience to the order has been wilful or contumacious: Mudginberri Station [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 105-107 and 111-113.

I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the separate publications on the Adelaide Institute website of the material which has established each of the charges which I have found proven was wilful and contumacious. The fact that the AI Document has appeared regularly on the Adelaide Institute website on each of the days accessed and can be accessed through a number of the Adelaide Institute newsletters is evidence of a wilful and contumacious disobedience of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.

Moreover, the number of statements which have been identified by the applicant in support of the charges giving rise to the imputations, in particular imputations 1 and 2 of the September 2002 orders which I have found proven on the various dates upon which the Adelaide Institute website was accessed, shows a wilful and contumacious disregard of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General v Punch Ltd [2002] UKHL 50 ; (2003) 1 All ER 289</tocase>
<text>In Attorney-General v Punch Ltd [2002] UKHL 50 ; (2003) 1 All ER 289 , Lord Nicholls said at [35]: 
 An interlocutory injunction, like any other injunction, must be expressed in terms which are clear and certain. The injunction must define precisely what acts are prohibited. The Court must ensure that the language of its order makes it plain what is permitted and what is prohibited. This is a well-established, soundly based principle. The person should not be put at risk of being in contempt of court by an ambiguous prohibition, or a prohibition the scope of which is obviously open to dispute.

It was argued that the September 2002 orders were imprecise and vague in that in paragraph 3 of the orders reference was made to "substantially similar content to the document 'About the Adelaide Institute'". It was contended that the form of order required the respondent to make a subjective assessment of what might be substantially similar content to that which was contained in the document "About the Adelaide Institute". It was contended that in those circumstances the order was so vague that it should not be the subject matter of contempt proceedings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/30.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 135 of the Evidence Act applies to both criminal and civil trials. It permits the Court to refuse to admit evidence if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the party against whom the evidence is sought to be tendered. It seems to me the unguarded admissions made by a party which are sought to be used for the purpose of proving the party to be in contempt of Court and therefore liable to be imprisoned could be unfairly prejudicial to that party. They might, if admitted, mean that that party is put at a forensic disadvantage by having to give evidence to explain the admissions where otherwise that party would choose not to give evidence. The Courts have said the inability to cross-examine on material sought to be adduced in a civil trial may attract the discretion in s 135: Bakerland Pty Ltd v Coleridge [2002] NSWCA 30 at [55] ; Longhurst v Hunt [2004] NSWCA 91 at [46] - [49] .</text>

<tocase>Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd [1973] Ch 281</tocase>
<text>Of course, the November 2007 undertaking is in a different class. The respondent gave the undertaking himself. He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect. So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking. An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were an order of the Court. It is a contempt to breach an undertaking the same as it is to disobey an order of the Court: Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd [1973] Ch 281 ; Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; (1986) 19 FCR 110. A breach of an undertaking will involve the same consequences for the party in breach as disobedience of an order of the Court: Milburn v Newton Colliery (1908) 52 S.J. 317. Where the undertaking is given to the Court by the person who is to be bound by the undertaking, the undertaking does not need to be served upon that person before contempt proceedings for a breach of that undertaking are commenced. Order 37 rule 3 only applies to orders, not undertakings: Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; 19 FCR 110.

<tocase>Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 </tocase>
<text>Relevantly, her Honour found that the respondent controlled the Adelaide Institute and thereby was responsible for its actions, and for the material which was published on the Adelaide Institute's websites. She found that the material contained in the AI Document conveyed the imputations which were the subject matters of the orders mentioned above. She found that publishing material on a website which is not password protected had the effect of communicating that information to the public. Such publication allows persons who access the website with a browser to view the material. Her Honour described how the material moves through the World Wide Web by relying on the description given in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 at [60]: 
 The Internet is a means of global communication that relies on a universal set of protocols or standards for the transmission of information. Two related sets of communication instructions, Transmission Control Protocol, (TCP) and Internet Protocol, (IP), govern how information will move through the system, defining addresses, routing systems, and all the regulation necessary to permit communication among users.

Her Honour also relied on the Tribunal's description of the World Wide Web at [67]: 
 The World Wide Web, (the "Web"), is a specific application that uses the Internet to send and display data, including text, graphics, audio and video. There are two active components on the Web: a server that stores and transmits information, and a client or browser that requests, receives and displays the information obtained from the server. A "web site" is a collection of computer files that are coded in a specific way ... to allow information to be sent on request to a browser. The files are then displayed in a way consistent with the instructions provided by the creator of the web site. Every web site has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), akin to their Internet address. Once connected to the Internet, the URL ... is necessary to gain access to a given web site ...

Her Honour found that publication of the AI Document on the World Wide Web amounted to conduct which was rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act and made a declaration accordingly.

Her Honour found that the AI Document and other material published by the respondent on the World Wide Web conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2 of the September 2002 orders.

Her Honour found that the first and second imputations would engender feelings of hurt and pain within members of the Jewish Community who would, by reason of the publication, consider themselves being treated contemptuously, disrespectfully and offensively. She also found that the third and fourth imputations would offend, insult, hurt and wound members of the Jewish Community and engender the same senses.

The judge found that the publication of the AI Document was unlawful under s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and that it was published because of the ethnic origin of the people in the group identified in the document, namely Jews and it was an act reasonably likely to humiliate and intimidate Jewish people.

The judge found that the respondent had not established any exceptions under s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act .

Her Honour made a permanent injunction restraining the respondent first, from publishing to the public on the World Wide Web the AI Document or any document with substantially similar content to that document; and secondly, from publishing any material which would convey the imputations which she had previously found to be unlawful. The respondent's reaction

The respondent appealed against the September 2002 orders.

The respondent deleted all material on the website within the time prescribed by paragraph 1 of her Honour's orders. That action indicates an awareness of the September 2002 orders. However, some time before 23 September 2002, the material which was contained in the AI Document was again published on the same website.

On 14 December 2002 the respondent attended the 3 rd International Historical Revisionism Conference in Italy and published further material on the website.

On 5 February 2003 the respondent entered the September 2002 orders. Initially the respondent argued that the sealed order now on file did not reflect her Honour's reasons but that argument was abandoned. The respondent's appeal

On 22 April 2003 the respondent filed an amended notice of appeal against the September 2002 orders. The notice of appeal did not challenge the finding made by Branson J that publication of the material was conduct which was rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act , being conduct which was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate the groups or persons identified by her Honour.

Three matters were argued on the appeal. First, that Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act was unconstitutional. Secondly, the material which had been published on the website did not have a sufficient degree of causal connection with race, colour or national or ethnic origin as required by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . Thirdly, the published material fell within the exemption to the provisions of Part IIA in s 18D.

In May 2003, at or about the time the matter was heard by the Full Court, the respondent published on the website "that the appeal would signal how strong the Jewish Zionist influence is in Australia's judiciary where a battle rages between common law and talmudic law."

The Full Court dismissed the respondent's challenge to the validity of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act . Carr and Kiefel JJ found that the provisions of Part IIA were supported by the external affairs power. Allsop J found that Part IIA , ss 18C and 18C (1)(b) "in its statutory context, are reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adopted to implement the obligations ... assumed by Australia" under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination done at New York on 7 March 1966. The Full Court found that the AI Document was calculated to offend in itself those who maintain that the holocaust occurred and, in particular, Jewish people. It concluded at least one reason the AI Document was published was because of the race or ethnic origin of Jewish Australians. It found that the AI Document was deliberately provocative and inflammatory, and contrived to smear Jews. It rejected the respondent's contention that he was entitled to an exemption by reason of s 18D(b) which provides that s 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any publication made for genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest.

I disagree. The intention of the September 2002 orders is to prevent Dr Toben from continuing to engage in conduct that is rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . The September 2002 orders were designed to achieve that result in two ways. First, in paragraph 2 by requiring Dr Toben to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2(a)(iii). Branson J made that clear when she approved at [111] the approach taken by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which considered the utility of making any order in a similar case. In the case of Citron v Z&uuml;ndel 41 CHRR D/74, the Tribunal said at [300]: 
 Any remedy awarded by this, or any Tribunal, will inevitably serve a number of purposes: prevention and elimination of discriminatory practises is only one of the outcomes flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings. There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint. Similarly, there is the potential educative and ultimately larger preventative benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision.

Paragraph 3 of the orders was designed to ensure that once there had been compliance with paragraph 2 of the orders, conduct of the kind which gave rise to the declaration in paragraph 1 would not be repeated. To that end, paragraph 3 restrains Dr Toben from publishing the AI Document anywhere on the World Wide Web and further restrains him from publishing material with substantially similar content to that document. It was necessary to include paragraph 3(b) because otherwise it might have been said by Dr Toben that he was entitled to publish on the World Wide Web information which was in slightly different form to that which was contained in the AI Document. Paragraph 3(c) of the orders is designed to reflect, insofar as future conduct is concerned, that which Dr Toben was obliged to remove from the World Wide Web website in accordance with paragraph 2(a)(iii).

In my opinion, the orders are not imprecise or vague and uncertain. They do not become so because they require the party to whom they are directed to make a subjective assessment of the material which may be published on the World Wide Web.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/130.html</AustLII>
<text>It was put by way of an alternative argument that the September 2002 orders ought to be construed as not intending to deny Dr Toben his right of free speech which was said to be given him by s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act . Mr Perkins relied upon Evans v New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 130 ; (2008) 168 FCR 576. In that case, the Full Court of this Court held regulations made under the World Youth Day Regulation 2008 (NSW) which were in turn made under the World Youth Day Act 2006 (NSW) are invalid in that they impermissibly infringe freedom of speech. I do not think that directly impacts upon the proposition which was put by the respondent.

I think the proposition that must be accepted is that the September 2002 orders were made for the purpose of preventing the respondent from engaging in conduct that is rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act . They ought to be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act in the sense that Branson J would not have intended to make orders preventing the respondent from doing something which was otherwise lawful.

The September 2002 orders ought to be understood as only preventing the respondent from doing something which is unlawful. The purpose of the orders was to require him to desist from further publications in contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act and requiring him to remove publications which had already been held to contravene the Racial Discrimination Act .</text>

<tocase>Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodial Holdings [2008] FCA 1041</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1041.html</AustLII>
<text>Lastly, the respondent argued that Dr Toben was provoked by Mr Jones' publication in the Australian Jewish News to publishing the material which he did and breaching the undertaking. The respondent relied on Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodial Holdings [2008] FCA 1041. I do not, with respect, think that that case stands for the proposition which was put. That case involved an application for discovery and the judge made some observations about a party having the right to apply to be released from an undertaking.

But, in any event, there are a number of difficulties with this argument. First, the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking operated in their terms for all circumstances. Dr Toben was obliged to comply with the terms of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the September 2002 orders until such time as those orders were varied or revoked. If he thought that Mr Jones had said something that would have allowed him to respond, but for the orders to which he was subjected, he could have applied to the Court for a variation or revocation of those orders. He was not entitled for himself to ignore those orders. Secondly, there is no evidence that he responded as he did because of the provocation which he said was displayed by Mr Jones. His articles suggest that he thought he had some right to respond because of what was published in the Australian Jewish News but there is no evidence because he gave none that he was provoked into doing what he did. Thirdly, and in any event, intention is not an element that needs to be established by the moving party when that party seeks punishment for contempt by another party disobeying an order of the Court.

For all of those reasons, those arguments fail.</text>

<text>In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 , Lockhart J (with whom Gummow J agreed and French J generally agreed) said at 259: 
 Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction. Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1080.html</AustLII>
<text>Moreover, the argument put does not assist the respondent in the proceeding because the respondent has not tendered any evidence at all and there is no evidence that would bring the respondent within s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act . The onus was on the respondent to establish an entitlement to an exemption under s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act : Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [127] and [230].

Next it was put that the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth) (the Citizenship Act) has the effect of rendering the September 2002 orders nugatory. It was not explained what was meant by the term "rendering the order nugatory" but unless the Citizenship Act had the effect of discharging or revoking the September 2002 orders then the orders would continue to stand.

Mr Perkins relied upon the preamble in the Citizenship Act which provides: 
 The Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity. 

 
 The Parliament recognises that persons conferred Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations: 

 
 (a) by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people; and 

 
 (b) by sharing their democratic beliefs; and 

 
 (c) by respecting their rights and liberties; and 

 
 (d) by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/43.html</AustLII>
<text>He relied upon Roach v Electoral Commission [2007] HCA 43 ; (2007) 233 CLR 162. That case was concerned with provisions of the Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) which disqualified as voters at federal elections persons who were serving sentences of imprisonment regardless of duration for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. In the course of his reasons, Gleeson CJ said at [12]: 
 The preamble to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth) declares that Parliament recognises that Australian citizenship represents full and formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations. The reference to the reciprocity of rights and obligations is important in the context of membership of the community. Serious offending may warrant temporary suspension of one of the rights of membership, that is, the right to vote. Emphasis upon civic responsibilities a the corollary of political rights and freedoms, and upon society's legitimate interest in promoting recognition of responsibilities as well as acknowledgment of rights, has been influential in contemporary legal explanation of exclusions from the franchise as consistent with the idea of universal adult suffrage.

In my opinion, those remarks have no relevance to the issues under consideration. Dr Toben has not been deprived of any rights attaching to citizenship.

The declaration in paragraph 1 of the September 2002 orders is that the respondent in publishing the AI Document engaged in conduct rendered unlawful by Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act . The injunctions in paragraph 2 require him to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which convey the imputations to which reference is made. That order contemplates that anything published which contains those imputations would contravene s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . The injunctions in paragraph 3 make the same assumptions. The injunctions restrain him from engaging in conduct which the Racial Discrimination Act renders unlawful. No citizen is entitled to engage in similar unlawful conduct because of the provisions of s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . Dr Toben has not lost any of the incidents of citizenship which are given by the Citizenship Act.

Of course, the November 2007 undertaking is in a different class. The respondent gave the undertaking himself. He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect. So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking. An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were an order of the Court. It is a contempt to breach an undertaking the same as it is to disobey an order of the Court: Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd [1973] Ch 281 ; Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; (1986) 19 FCR 110. A breach of an undertaking will involve the same consequences for the party in breach as disobedience of an order of the Court: Milburn v Newton Colliery (1908) 52 S.J. 317. Where the undertaking is given to the Court by the person who is to be bound by the undertaking, the undertaking does not need to be served upon that person before contempt proceedings for a breach of that undertaking are commenced. Order 37 rule 3 only applies to orders, not undertakings: Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; 19 FCR 110.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1911/22.html</AustLII>
<text>Dr Toben has published remarks which might be described as insulting of the Court and which tend to scandalise the Court. An act which is calculated to lower the authority of the Court or a judge of the Court or an act which is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice will be a contempt: The King v Nicholls [1911] HCA 22 ; (1911) 12 CLR 280. The first class is often referred to as scandalising the Court. Mr Perkins, Dr Toben's counsel, argued that the Court should not have regard to those remarks in considering whether these charges of contempt have been made out.

I think that contention is partly right. Clearly enough, whatever remarks Dr Toben has made about the Court would not be relevant in determining whether his other remarks or his other publication was in disobedience of the September 2002 orders or breached the November 2007 undertaking.

However, his remarks may be relevant for that aspect of the applicant's case which is directed to establishing contumacy.</text>

<tocase>Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/137.html</AustLII>
<text>In particular, Carr J (with whom Alsop J agreed) said in relation to the last matter ( Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515 at [43] ): 
 In my opinion the contents of the document, taken as a whole, do not establish on the balance of probabilities that publication by the respondent of it was done reasonably and in good faith for any genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest. 

 
 In the context of knowing that Australian Jewish people would be offended by the challenge which the appellant sought to make, a reasonable person acting in good faith would have made every effort to express the challenge and his views with as much restraint as was consistent with the communication of those views. 

 
 In my opinion, the Document shows that the appellant made no such effort. On the contrary, the terms of the Document are, in my view, deliberately provocative and inflammatory. The reference to the Lenin and Stalin eras was, in my opinion, contrived to smear those on the receiving end of the appellant's message. The appellant described the Jews as "also murderers". This reference was made almost as an aside, clearly to paint the Jews in a bad light, before the author resumed his flamboyantly-worded challenge. 

 
 I think that the primary judge was correct in finding that there was no proof of good faith. I would go further and hold that there is no proof that the publication was done reasonably or in good faith. 

 The respondent's publications after the Full Court decision and before 16 November 2006

Between the delivery of judgment by the Full Court and November 2006, the respondent published on the website a plethora of information which is contained in Exhibit "JJ1" to the applicant's affidavit sworn on 1 November 2006 and which had been read by the applicant on 18 August 2006 and was subsequently re-read on 11 October 2007.

I set out a summary of the applicant's claims of breaches of the September 2002 orders occurring after those orders were made and before 16 November 2006: 
 July 2003 Attributes ulterior motives to what it describes as "Holocaust propaganda". Refers to Diary of Anne Frank as one of "those self-serving Holocaust frauds", to "Holocaust stories and myths", and repeatedly to the "Holocaust lie". 

 
 September 2003 Attacks the decision of the Full Court and "extremist Jews" said to be currently "over-represented in politics, the media and the judiciary", refers to "historical lies such as the drummed up six-million lies" and to the "filthy lie" of the "Holohoax". 

 
 9 October 2003 It contains repeated denials that the Holocaust ever happened accompanied by viciously racist and antisemitic statements. 

 
 10-11 October 2003 It contains repeated denials that the Holocaust happened and says that the respondent is "pushing the limits of a Federal Court of Australia gag order, and pressuring the upholders of the Holocaust orthodoxy to admit they are living on [!] a lie". 

 
 3 January 2004 Refers to the "holocaust dogma of Judaism" being used to enslave Christian Germany and the rest of the world and as propaganda to achieve the creation of Israel and to get money by blackmail and extortion. 

 
 February 2004 Refers to Holocaust museums and reparations claims as "just a gimmick to collect money". Case proven that the holocaust was a hoax. There were no gas chambers. 

 
 March 2004 Refers to the "'Hitler gas chamber legend'", "the non-existent 'Hitler gas chambers'" and Holocaust myths as propagated by Jews, the Soviets and others for ulterior purposes and describes the Jewish author of a book on Holocaust revisionism as a "Holocaust Pimp". States "the holocaust is a lie", that school education teaches "the lies of the holocaust" and refers to "the Auschwitz Lie". The Germans had no gas chambers, no gas vans, and did not commit any inexcusable crimes. Revisionists understand that the holocaust did not happen. 

 
 November 2005 Refers inter alia to "more Holocaust rubbish", "'Holocaust' educational fraud program", a "tsunami of lies" preventing discussion of Nazi extermination of Jews in homicidal gas chambers, the "Hoaxoco$t Blood Libel", "the hoax of the century" etc and contains grossly antisemitic, racist and hate-filled material about Jews and the Holocaust. 

 
 January 2005 A report in The Tehran Times on 29 December 2005 of an interview with him, which was still there on 24 April 2008 and 23 May 2008, containing inter alia the following: 

 
 Fredrick Toben, the director of the Adelaide Institute in Australia, believes that Israel was created based on the Holocaust myth. On December 19, the Mehr News Agency conducted an interview with Toben to ask why Western countries were so outraged when Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad called the Holocaust a myth. Following is the text of the interview: 

 
 Q: The Iranian president said that he thinks that the Holocaust is a myth. However, he also said some European countries insist that millions of innocent Jews were killed during the Second World War by Hitler, and asked why the Europeans don't give part of their land to the Jews if they are correct. What is your view? 

 
 A: The Holocaust is a lie because none of its three main pillars on which it rests are factually true or proven. 

 
 1. Germany Hitler systematically exterminated European Jewry. There is simply no proof of this claim it was a transfer of Jews, and together with Zionist collaboration, German Jews arrived in Palestine with their property. Others were moved out of German territory and Auschwitz was a transit camp. 

 
 2. The killing was done in huge chemical slaughterhouses homicidal gas chambers. This is a technical impossibility because you can work out how long it would take, for example, to kill one million people the size of a city like Adelaide without anyone finding out about it. The world soon found out President Bush lied about Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction that lie didn't last even one year. 

 
 3. Six million Jews were killed this number is mythical/religious and although at one time the numbers killed at Auschwitz was claimed to be 4 million, then reduced to 1-1.5 million, and now to around 500,000, the six million remains the same. Why? 

 
 Anyone who questions these three points is imprisoned and Revisionists must ask these questions if they wish to know the facts about the Holocaust story. 

 
 February 2006 Refers to the Holocaust as the "alleged Holocaust of the Jews, a lie whose ravages, wrought for more than half a century now ... are a disaster that worsens from year to year", a legend or myth, "a gigantic slander, blackmail and extortion operation", an imposture for ulterior purposes, "dumb as doggy dodo Sixpackers", "the hoaxaco$t fairytale", "elite Jewry's shakedown of the Swiss banks", "Jews who expected some payout for their time spent at the Awshucks labour camp", "embezzlers", "the Auschwitz Lie", "the holocaust fable" etc. 

 
 2 March 2006 Contains antisemitic, racist material of the worst kind and is endorsed by the respondent with the banner and motto of the Adelaide Institute and a copyright-free notation at the end of it. 

 
 March 2006 Praises Ahmadinejad for his denial of the Holocaust and refers to the Holocaust as "a deliberately contrived falsehood" and a hoax with a Zionist provenance and motivation. 

 
 March 2006 Refers to the "Holocaust" lie and hoax propagated by the Jews for ulterior motives and out of hatred, made derogatory comments about the applicant, whom he referred to as "Australia's own paranoid Jew", referred to the Holocaust as a propaganda weapon to create world sympathy for Israel, said he was testing the limits of free speech, and stated that the Holocaust is a "myth/lie" and that Holocaust believers are either ignorant or liars. 

 
 April 2006 Says the myth of the Holocaust was used to create and defend Israel, the gas chambers never existed at Auschwitz or anywhere else, the Holocaust is an extraordinarily profitable lie and a swindle.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/41.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondent next argued that the September 2002 orders were vague or unclear and therefore cannot be enforced in contempt proceedings, and in that regard relied upon the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Network Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41.

In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 , Lockhart J (with whom Gummow J agreed and French J generally agreed) said at 259: 
 Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction. Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed. 

 
That decision was approved in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41.</text>

<tocase>Wimpole v McIlwraith [1923] VLR 553</tocase>
<text>The applicant argued, relying upon a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Wimpole v McIlwraith [1923] VLR 553 , that those paragraphs of the respondent's which contained admissions were admissible without the applicant being required to tender the whole of the affidavit. In that case, Mann J said at 555: 
 I think in trials without juries there has been in our Courts some diversity of practice about this matter, and I think the reason is that there are two courses that may be taken, and which lead now practically to the same result. One course I might take here would be to admit the four paragraphs tendered, subject to and along with any other qualifying paragraphs to which the defendant's counsel would be at liberty to refer without thereby being taken to be tendering evidence. The other alternative is to insist on the whole document going in, but with these reservations, which seem to be just&#8212;firstly, that the plaintiff putting in the document would only be bound by the admissions to which he calls attention and any qualifications contained in any other part of the document. The defendant would not be treated as calling evidence by calling attention to any such qualifications. As regards statements appearing elsewhere in the affidavit prejudicial to the plaintiff, I should hold that he is not bound by them in the circumstances, and, so far as those statements were in support of facts, the proof of which was on the defendant, I should not accept them as being sufficient proof of those facts by the defendant for the purpose of satisfying that proof.

I refused to admit those parts of the respondent's affidavits which contained admissions. If it were a criminal trial, s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Evidence Act ) would give the Court a discretion to refuse to admit the evidence of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. The admissions were contained in affidavits filed prior to the present charges being laid. The respondent was unrepresented at that time. He was apparently not warned that anything contained in an affidavit might be used against him in contempt proceedings. The applicant only seeks to put part of the respondent's affidavit, effectively reserving to himself the editing of the respondent's affidavits. However, this is not a criminal trial, even though the charges must be proved to the level of satisfaction required in a criminal trial, so s 90 of the Evidence Act does not control the admissibility of the evidence of an admission.</text>

<text>Of course, the November 2007 undertaking is in a different class. The respondent gave the undertaking himself. He has always been aware of that undertaking and its effect. So much is clear from his attempting to resile from the undertaking. An undertaking given to the Court is punishable in the same way as if it were an order of the Court. It is a contempt to breach an undertaking the same as it is to disobey an order of the Court: Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd [1973] Ch 281 ; Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; (1986) 19 FCR 110. A breach of an undertaking will involve the same consequences for the party in breach as disobedience of an order of the Court: Milburn v Newton Colliery (1908) 52 S.J. 317. Where the undertaking is given to the Court by the person who is to be bound by the undertaking, the undertaking does not need to be served upon that person before contempt proceedings for a breach of that undertaking are commenced. Order 37 rule 3 only applies to orders, not undertakings: Windsurfing International Inc v Sailboard Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 384 ; 19 FCR 110. Separate charges for breaches of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking</text>

<tocase>Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525</tocase>
<text>In Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 , Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the distinction between civil and criminal contempts as illusory. In that case, the majority held that because contempt proceedings are brought to punish the contemnor either for the purpose of vindicating judicial authority or for the purpose of coercing obedience to an order, the proceedings must realistically be seen as criminal in nature. For that reason, whether the contempt is civil or criminal, the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The onus of establishing the contempt is, of course, on the party asserting it.</text>
