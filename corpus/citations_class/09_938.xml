<text>This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 21 May 2009 ( SZMXP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 495) in which the Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the Tribunal ), made on 24 September 2008 and handed down on 16 October 2008. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.

The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, who arrived in Australia on 21 February 2008. On 3 March 2008 the appellant lodged an Application for a Protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. A delegate of the first respondent refused the appellant's Application for a Protection visa on 30 May 2008.

On 23 June 2008, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his involvement with the Awami League in Bangladesh. The appellant claimed that he joined the student wing of the Awami League in 1989 while still at school, was elected president of the first year committee of the Bangladesh Chattra League at his college in 1991, and was elected General Secretary of the Janjira Thana Awami League Committee in 1994. He claimed that in 1996 he was elected an Executive Member and President of the Shariatpur District Awami League Committee.

The appellant also claimed that in 2001 the BNP and other Muslim fundamentalists declared him a stranger in the area where he lived and threatened that he would be killed by a bomb blast if he did not cease to act on behalf of the Awami League. He stated that he went to the police in light of these threats, but that the police were reluctant to help him because of his Awami League involvement. He claimed that the police advised him that, if he did not leave the area, they would arrest him as they had received a complaint against him. He claimed that he fled to Dhaka, where a senior party figure organised work for him in Singapore. He claimed that, after he fled his home, BNP-Jammat activists destroyed his house and threatened his family members and that the police came to his house on a number of occasions to arrest him.

He stated that he returned to Bangladesh on 3 February 2008 following the appointment of a caretaker government there. He claimed that, upon his return on that occasion, the police went to his home to arrest him and that, on 18 February 2008, he again fled to Singapore, from where he then travelled to Australia.

The Federal Magistrate held that the issues in the present case were indistinguishable from those in SZNEC [2009] FMCA 432. The Federal Magistrate said ( SZMXP [2009] FMCA 495 at [7] ): 
 In my view, it is clear that the outcome in this case is determined by the decision of the Full Court in SZLPO . Based upon the reasoning of the Full Court, and my own analysis of that reasoning in SZNEC , there was no breach of s.424 or s. 424B in this case. Section 424(2) does not apply because the Tribunal was not seeking additional information from a natural person. Neither, on the facts of this case, was DFAT acting as the agent of the Tribunal. Because s.424(2) does not apply, neither does s.424B. It follows that no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal has been established and the application must be dismissed as a privative clause decision. I will so order.</text>

<text>Ground 2 raises considerations on the merits and questions of fact. The conclusion which the Tribunal reached, it seems to me, was open to it. The appellant has submitted that the Tribunal did not consider the reality of the chance of his persecution because of his political opinions and social activities. However, a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons makes clear that these matters were considered, and considered in detail. At the heart of the Tribunal's conclusion in this respect, as I have already mentioned, are questions of fact and credibility, which are matters for the Tribunal alone (see Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 ; and NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10).</text>

<text>The additional matter raised in the appellant's Written Submission is also a matter which I think the appellant has failed to make good. The Tribunal used appropriate means to contact the officer in charge at the Jagira Police Station and received a communication from that person to the effect that the alleged charges were not genuine. I do not think that this is a case where further investigation on the part of the Tribunal was required (see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169 170).</text>

<tocase>SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/51.html</AustLII>
<text>Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant claimed that the Tribunal had erred because it had failed to comply with s 424(3)(a) and s 424B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( the Act ). The Federal Magistrate took the view that these points were covered by the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407. The Federal Magistrate also relied upon a decision of his own in SZNEC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 432.

The Federal Magistrate held that the issues in the present case were indistinguishable from those in SZNEC [2009] FMCA 432. The Federal Magistrate said ( SZMXP [2009] FMCA 495 at [7] ): 
 In my view, it is clear that the outcome in this case is determined by the decision of the Full Court in SZLPO . Based upon the reasoning of the Full Court, and my own analysis of that reasoning in SZNEC , there was no breach of s.424 or s. 424B in this case. Section 424(2) does not apply because the Tribunal was not seeking additional information from a natural person. Neither, on the facts of this case, was DFAT acting as the agent of the Tribunal. Because s.424(2) does not apply, neither does s.424B. It follows that no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal has been established and the application must be dismissed as a privative clause decision. I will so order.

The Federal Magistrate, in my view, correctly applied the principles to be found in SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407. In substance, the following can be gleaned from SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407: 
(1) Information captured by s 424(2) of the Act must be information additional to information previously given to the Tribunal by the invitee ( SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 at [99] [100]);
 
(2) The word "person" in s 424(2) means a "natural person" ( SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 at [103] [108]);
 
(3) The word "person" in s 424(2) is limited by reference to a person whose identity is known at the time of the extending of the invitation ( SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 at [109] ); and
 
(4) A document is not "information," although it may contain information, and therefore s 424(2) does not apply to an invitation to a person to supply a document to the Tribunal ( SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 at [110] [114]).

In SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 , the Full Court noted that in some circumstances, DFAT could be treated as an agent of the Tribunal. The Court noted (at [118]) that, where the invitation from the Tribunal leaves it to the recipient of the invitation to determine who to approach, it could not be said that the recipient of the invitation was the agent of the Tribunal. However, at [119] [120], the Full Court went on to say that, where the invitation from the Tribunal requests the recipient to contact a particular person, this circumstance might well suggest that the recipient was the Tribunal's agent.

In the present matter, the Tribunal wrote to DFAT and requested that DFAT provide advice on the authenticity of various documents. DFAT replied, advising the Tribunal that it was highly unlikely that a judge would issue one of the letters under consideration and that it was easy in Bangladesh for someone to hire an advocate to issue letters such as the letter submitted by the appellant. DFAT further advised that the officer in charge of the Jagira Police Station in Shariatpur had described the First Information Report and charge sheet as fraudulent and had confirmed that those papers could not be found in the official record kept at that police station. The Tribunal then wrote to the appellant, pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act, advising him of the content of the DFAT report and putting a series of matters to him that might influence the Tribunal's decision when it was ultimately called upon to decide his application.

The appellant had an opportunity to respond to the letter and he did so. His response was that the documents which he had submitted were genuine.

In the end, as I have already mentioned, the Tribunal did not accept a great deal of what the appellant had to say in support of his claims. These were all essentially findings of fact.

The Federal Magistrate found that, because of the binding nature of SZLPO [2009] FCAFC 51 ; 255 ALR 407 , he was bound to conclude that the Tribunal had not breached s 424 or s 424B of the Act. His Honour also held that s 424(2) of the Act did not apply because the Tribunal was not seeking additional information from a natural person. His Honour also found that DFAT was not acting as the agent of the Tribunal.

In my view, the conclusions reached by the Federal Magistrate were correct. In my view, s 424 does not apply in the circumstances of the present case, for the reasons which the Federal Magistrate gave. In addition, the substance of the DFAT report and the sources of the information contained in that report were disclosed to the appellant in the letter which the Tribunal wrote to him and he was given appropriate particulars of those matters.

Accordingly, for these reasons, I do not think that the appellant has made out Ground 1.</text>
