<tocase>Kim v Witton (1995) 59 FCR 258 </tocase>
<text>26 Her Honour described the application as no more than an application seeking merits review, and as one not disclosing any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. She said that the findings of the Tribunal that there had been a breach of Condition 8101 were open to the Tribunal, by a combination of what the applicant said he had been doing and what he had said to the delegate, so that the activity at Stonemasons was one that normally attracts reimbursement (cf Kim v Witton (1995) 59 FCR 258 at 268). Her Honour also concluded that the Tribunal's finding that the reasons for not cancelling the visa did not outweigh the reason for cancelling the visa was open to it on the material before it.

27 Consequently, the Tribunal decision was not infected by jurisdictional error and the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed.

28 The present application is supported by an affidavit of the applicant to which is annexed proposed grounds of appeal. There is substantial overlap in what is said in each of those documents.</text>

<tocase>Sandoval v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 71</tocase>
<text>37 In Sandoval v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 71, Gray J at 90-92 addressed the question whether the decision-maker in exercising the discretion under s 116(1) of the Act was bound to comply with the directions in a Migration Series Instruction. His Honour in El Ess v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 142 FCA 43 , in a different factual context, decided that the prescriptions in a Policy Advice Manual published also under s 499 of the Act were not binding, and so were not relevant considerations to a decision-maker as that expression is explained in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24. By reason of the decision in Sandoval , I think it is arguable that at least the primary considerations in the Migration Series Manual referred to at [16] above were required to be addressed by the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543</tocase>
<text>43 I should note that the arguable ground of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal was not explicitly identified before the Federal Magistrate. It emerged in the course of submissions on this application, prompted by a general reference in the proposed notice of appeal to the decision of the Tribunal being unfair and not carefully considered. I am mindful of the observations of the Full Court in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 at [18] about the circumstances in which a new or refined proposed ground of appeal should be allowed in such circumstances, but as the applicant was not represented and because the Federal Magistrate was asked to consider generally the way in which the Tribunal had exercised its discretion under s 116(1), I think this is a case in which the point should be allowed to be considered on appeal.

44 I will hear the parties as to how the appeal should now progress.

 I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.
