<text>The restriction in s 477A: 
 ... imposes a condition which is of the essence of a new right 

 
(per Windeyer J in Australian Iron &amp; Steel Limited v Hoogland [1962] HCA 13 ; (1962) 108 CLR 471 at 488) and thus:
 
 ... stipulates an essential condition or jurisdictional requirement ... 

 
(per the High Court in Rudolphy v Lightfoot [1999] HCA 61 ; (1999) 197 CLR 500 at [9] and [10] (p 507)) for the Federal Court in respect of applications brought pursuant to s 476A of the Act.

These propositions were expressly taken up and applied by Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ in a joint judgment in WACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 at [32] and [33] (p 198); [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 79 ALJR 94 (p 100) where their Honours said: The restriction in s 478 is of a different character to that of typical statutes of limitation which operate to impose a limit of time upon an existing right of action. They operate to bar the prosecution of actions otherwise not subject to such a time limit. In that sense, statutes of limitation are preventative. However, s 478 does not "bar an existing cause of action"; rather, "[i]t imposes a condition which is of the essence of a new right". [ Australian Iron &amp; Steel Ltd v Hoogland [1962] HCA 13 ; (1962) 108 CLR 471 at 488; Rudolphy v Lightfoot [1999] HCA 61 ; (1999) 197 CLR 500 at 507 8 [10] [11]; [1999] HCA 61 ; 167 ALR 105 at 107.] Thus, s 478(1)(b) and (2) restrict what otherwise would be the conferral upon the Federal Court of jurisdiction by the parliament under ss 76(ii) and 77 (i) of the Constitution . The new jurisdiction so conferred is remedial in nature, although the remedy is confined by the time restriction upon the institution of the proceeding. The provision of information to the unsuccessful visa applicant by the RRT is a necessary step to equip the applicant with the wherewithal to institute such a proceeding in the Federal Court.
 Paragraph (a) of s 478(1) stipulates that an application to the Federal Court be made in the manner specified by the Rules. At the relevant time, those Rules [O 54B r 2(1)] required that an application be in accordance with form 56. This required the applicant to describe how he or she was aggrieved by the decision, the grounds for the application, and the orders sought. That information may be acquired for use in this way by an examination of the reasons of the RRT indicated in the written statement.</text>

<text>In the present case, two Notices purporting to be notices under this section were given to the Attorneys-General of the States. No notice was required to be given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth because the Minister is a party to the proceedings (see s 78B(3)(b) and see Inglis v Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia [1969] HCA 44 ; (1969) 119 CLR 334 at 336 337).

The first Notice is not now relied upon.

The second Notice is dated 21 August 2008 and was filed in the Registry of the Court on 22 August 2008. It was served soon after. Every State (except Victoria) expressly declined to intervene. The State of Victoria has not expressly indicated a position, one way or the other. That State did not, however, seek leave to intervene in or be joined as a party to the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/137.html</AustLII>
<text>In order to deal with the applicant's argument, it is necessary to understand the statutory framework within which the decisions under challenge were made. French J, as he then was, summarised the relevant provisions at [20] to [25] (pp 503 505) in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494 as follows: The statutory basis for the Minister's decision is to be found in s 501(2) of the Migration Act which provides: 
'501(2) The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: 
 
(a) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and 
 
(b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.'
 
 
This is to be read in conjunction with s 501(6) and s 501(7). Relevantly, those subsections provide: 
 
'501(6) For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if: 
 
(a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7));
 
...
 
(7) For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if: 
 
...
 
(c) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; 
 
...'
 As the present application raises the question whether or not the applicant was the holder of a 'absorbed persons visa' under the Act it is necessary to have regard to the provisions of the Act and Regulations relating to that class of visa. The Migration Act 1958 provided originally for entry into Australia to be regulated by entry permits to be granted by officers of the Department of Immigration (s 6(2)). Such permits could be cancelled by the Minister 'in his absolute discretion' (s 7(1)). The Act also provided for the deportation of aliens and immigrants under various conditions (ss 12 and 22). The Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 (Cth) enacted comprehensive amendments which included new provisions for the control of entry into Australia involving entry permits and visas. That system of control was succeeded by a visa-only system introduced by the Migration Reform Act 1992 (Cth) which was passed in November 1992. The relevant provisions of that amending legislation came into operation on 1 September 1994 for a more detailed account of this history see NAAV v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 193 ALR 499 at [386] to [393]. Under the Act as it stood prior to 1 September 1994, and by virtue of s 6(1) , an immigrant who entered Australia without an entry permit became a prohibited immigrant. Section 8 , however, relieved from the operation of those provisions an immigrant entering Australia without an entry permit being: 
'(e) A person who 
 
(i) is for the time being exempted, by instrument under the hand of the Minister, from the requirements of this Division relating to entry permits; or
 
(ii) is included in a class of persons who are for the time being so exempted not being a person in respect of whom a declaration is in force under the next succeeding subsection.'
 
There was an exemption which applied to persons entering Australia from New Zealand who were not required to hold an entry permit. This means that at the time Mr Johnson and his family entered Australia they were not required to hold entry permits and were not prohibited immigrants. 
 The effect of the amendments to the Act which came into operation on 1 September 1994 was that all non-citizens in the migration zone were required to hold a visa. Transitional provisions in relation to New Zealand citizens in Australia were provided for in regulations. Regulation 17 of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 provided: 
'(1) This sub-regulation applies to a non-citizen who: 
 
(a) is a New Zealand citizen; and 
 
(b) either: 
 
(i) was in Australia lawfully immediately before 1 September 1994; or
 
(ii) was, immediately before 1 September 1994 an illegal entrant because of s 20 of the old Act; and 
 
(c) is not taken to hold: 
 
(i) a transitional visa under Part 2 or 3; or
 
(ii) a Norfolk Island permanent resident visa under regulation 18; or
 
(iii) a sub-class 995 (Diplomatic) Visa under regulation 19; or
 
(iv) a special purpose visa; or
 
(v) an absorbed person visa; and 
 
(d) was not the subject of a deportation order immediately before 1 September 1994.
 
(2) A non-citizen to whom this regulation applies is taken to have been granted a special category visa on 1 September 1994.'
 
 25 Section 34 of the Migration Act provides: 

'34(1) There is a class of permanent visas to remain in, but not re-enter Australia, to be known as absorbed person visas. 
 
(2) A non-citizen in the migration zone who: 
 
(a) on 2 April 1984 was in Australia; and 
 
(b) before that date had ceased to be an immigrant; and 
 
(c) on or after that date, has not left Australia, where left Australia has the meaning it had in this Act before 1 September 1994; and 
 
(d) immediately before 1 September 1994, was not a person to whom s 20 of this Act as in force then applied; 
 
is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994.
 
(3) Subdivisions AA, AB, AC (other than s 68) , AE and AH do not apply in relation to absorbed person visas.'

I respectfully agree with and adopt his Honour's summary.

At the time when the applicant and her mother entered Australia, neither of them was required to hold an entry permit and neither of them was a prohibited immigrant.

Further, by reason of the amendments to the Act which came into operation on 1 September 1994, if the applicant did not thereby become the holder of an absorbed person visa , she was: 
 taken to have been granted a special category visa on 1 September 1994.

Thus, in the case of the applicant, by the operation of the amendments to the Act which came into force on 1 September 1994, she was either: 
(a) The holder of an absorbed person visa ; or
 
(b) The holder of a special category visa .

Despite the inconsistent positions adopted by the applicant, if the applicant did not hold an absorbed person visa at all times from 1 September 1994, then the delegate has purported to cancel a visa of a kind not held by the applicant at the time when the delegate's decision was made. In that event, the delegate will not have exercised the Minister's cancellation power with respect to the visa actually held by the applicant (per French J in Johnson [2004] FCA 137 ; 136 FCR 494 at [30] (pp 505 506). Such a purported exercise of that power in those circumstances would involve jurisdictional error because the delegate will not have addressed the actual question which s 501 of the Act required her to address. A decision infected by jurisdictional error of that kind would be wholly invalid and of no effect.

If the hypotheses outlined in [166] above are correct, then the same reasoning would lead to a conclusion that the Tribunal has also committed jurisdictional error when it made its decision on 20 December 2007.

It is therefore necessary to determine whether the applicant should be taken to have held an absorbed person visa as at 1 September 1994 and at all times thereafter.

In Johnson [2004] FCA 137 ; 136 FCR 494 at [33] to [47] (pp 506 511) French J reviewed a number of authorities which dealt with the statutory criterion "... ceased to be an immigrant before 2 April 1984 ... " (s 34(2)(b) of the Act). At [45] to [47] (pp 510 511), his Honour said: The general statements made about the concept of absorption offer little in the way of practical guidance for determining whether a person has become part of the community, either as an adult or as a minor who comes in with a family unit. In Koon Wing Lau v Calwell , Dixon J said (at 577): 
"... there does not appear to be any general agreement as to the tests for the application of this very vague conception."
 
The word "absorption" is an evaluative metaphor which invites consideration of a variety of factors relevant to its application. It is important to bear in mind also that it is a metaphor used in aid of the resolution of a question of constitutional fact, namely whether the person to whom it is applied has ceased to be an immigrant. The metaphor must not obscure the primary question.
 Having regard to the primary question, factors relevant to whether a person has become a member of the Australian community in the way that that concept was discussed in Potter v Minahan might be thought to include the following: The time that has elapsed since the person's entry into Australia. The existence and timing of the formation of an intention to settle permanently in Australia. The number and duration of absences. Family or other close personal ties in Australia. The presence of family members in Australia or the commitment of family members to come to Australia to join the person. Employment history. Economic ties including property ownership. Contribution to, and participation in, community activities. Any criminal record. 
This list of factors is plainly not exhaustive. Rather, it illustrates the multi-dimensional character of the judgment involved. It is also necessary in making that judgment to avoid narrow mono-cultural assumptions about what constitutes membership of the Australian community. This may not always make the judgment an easy one -- see generally D Wood, "Deportation, The Immigration Power and Absorption into the Australian Community" (1986) 16 Fed Law Rev 288.
 In the case of a child coming to Australia as part of a family unit it is necessary to apply the judgment about membership of the community to the child's parents or other adult guardians or carers with whom he or she has come and with whom he or she lives. At the time relevant to the present case Mr Johnson was aged nine years. It is therefore necessary to have regard to the evidence about his parents' migration to, and settlement in, this country and their position in April 1984.

I also respectfully agree with these observations made by his Honour and propose to follow the approach taken by his Honour in Johnson [2004] FCA 137 ; 136 FCR 494. This approach was expressly approved by a Full Court of this Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236 at [49] to [56] (pp 247 249) and by Branson J in Charlie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 171 FCR 44 at [31] and [32].

A non-citizen who has lawfully entered Australia and has been absorbed into the Australian community ceases to be an immigrant and passes beyond the scope of the immigration power (per French J in Johnson [2004] FCA 137 ; 136 FCR 494 at [44] (p 510)). In this sense, the question of absorption involves the determination of a constitutional fact.

In the present case, as I have already said, the applicant came to Australia with her mother on 28 September 1979.

By 2 April 1984, the applicant had resided in Australia continuously for approximately four and a half years. By that date, she was almost six years old.

I have already referred to the evidence concerning the question of whether the applicant's parents were living together as at September 1979 (as to which see [172] to [178] above).

However, the applicant made statements, both to the delegate and to the Tribunal, about certain facts, matters and events which she could remember having taken place in the early years after her arrival in Australia. The broad thrust of that general evidence was that her parents were more or less together in the early years after their arrival in 1979. According to the applicant, the applicant, her parents and her siblings lived as a family unit in those years.

The applicant also submitted that I should apply what her Counsel called an implied statutory bar of five years before an immigrant is capable of being absorbed into the Australian community. This submission was founded upon some remarks made by Deane J by way of obiter dicta in Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 35 ALR 186 ; (1981) 54 FLR 334 . In my view, there is no such implied bar. French J in Johnson [2004] FCA 137 ; 136 FCR 494 did not invoke such a bar. The other members of the Court in Kuswardana 35 ALR 186 ; 54 FLR 334 itself did not expressly agree with the dictum of Deane J. In my view, the application of such a bar, as an inflexible rule, introduces into the consideration of the criterion found in s 34(2)(b) of the Act an unnecessary and inappropriate level of rigidity. For example, it would mean that in every case where the relevant non-citizen had arrived after 2 April 1979, a finding would need to be made that, by reason of this fact alone, absorption had not occurred. In my judgment, as a matter of construction of the Act, no implied probationary period is prescribed. Ground 5 (The Lack of Independent Mind Ground)</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2106.html</AustLII>
<text>This ground is based upon the reasoning of Emmett J in Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) (2007) 99 ALD 514; [2007] FCA 2106 especially at [30] to [36].

I do not think that this ground has been made out. A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole demonstrates that it asked itself the right question, that is to say, that it put itself in the position of the primary decision-maker and exercised for itself the discretion reposed in it. In my view, it appropriately approached the decision which it was called upon to make as requiring it to decide whether or not to exercise the discretion to cancel. Therefore, in my view, the Tribunal did not fall into error.

For these reasons, I am of the view that Ground 11 has not been made out.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 ; (2007) 159 FCR 565</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/105.html</AustLII>
<text>In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 ; (2007) 159 FCR 565 (at [49]), a Full Court of this Court held that, for the purposes of s 477 of the Act, actual notification to an applicant of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal must be accomplished by physical delivery to the applicant personally of a written statement prepared by the Refugee Review Tribunal in accordance with s 430(1).

The language of s 477(1) is relevantly identical to the language of s 477A(1).

In the case of the Tribunal, the only statutory prescription for the giving of notification of its decision to a party to the proceedings before it is s 68AA. In terms of the reasoning applied by the Full Court in SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 ; 159 FCR 565 , that provision is a deeming provision. Applying the reasoning of the Full Court in that case, providing notice of the Tribunal's decision by post in accordance with s 68AA would be ineffective for the purposes of s 477 and also for the purposes of s 477A.

No regulations have been passed which prescribe the manner in which a decision is to be notified for the purposes of s 477A (as to which, see s 477A(4)).

Therefore, what is required in the present case for the notification required by s 477A is that a hard copy of the Tribunal's decision must be physically handed to the applicant personally.

As I have already said (at [31] and [36] above), on the evidence before me, the Minister has failed to prove that a hard copy of the Tribunal's decision was ever handed to the applicant personally.

Therefore, the Minister's objection to competency fails.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 476A was introduced into the Act by Act No 137 of 2005 and came into force on 1 December 2005. At the same time, s 5E was added. These two sections were intended to address the decision of the High Court in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. In that case, the High Court held that, for the purposes of the Act, the expression "... decision made under the [Migration] Act ... " did not include a decision which was infected by jurisdictional error. In that case, the Court referred to such decisions as "... decisions purportedly made under the Act ... ".

It may be that the effect of the 2005 amendments to the Act is to deprive s 39B of the Judiciary Act of any role to play in the judicial review by this Court of migration decisions and to confine applicants who seek such relief to the remedies provided by s 476A of the Act.

In the present case, for reasons which I will explain below, I do not need to decide this question and expressly refrain from doing so.

I will proceed to deal with the jurisdiction question upon the basis that the remedies potentially available to the applicant are confined to those afforded by s 476A of the Act.

Section 477A is in the following terms: 
 477A Time limits on applications to the Federal Court 
 (1) An application to the Federal Court for a remedy to be granted in exercise of the court's original jurisdiction under paragraph 476A(1)(b) or (c) in relation to a migration decision must be made to the court within 28 days of the actual (as opposed to deemed) notification of the decision.
 (2) The Federal Court may, by order, extend that 28 day period by up to 56 days if: 

(a) an application for that order is made within 84 days of the actual (as opposed to deemed) notification of the decision; and
 
(b) the Federal Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so.
 
 (3) Except as provided by subsection (2), the Federal Court must not make an order allowing, or which has the effect of allowing, an applicant to make an application mentioned in subsection (1) outside that 28 day period.
 (4) The regulations may prescribe the way of notifying a person of a decision for the purposes of this section.</text>

The provision of information to the unsuccessful visa applicant by the RRT is a necessary step to equip the applicant with the wherewithal to institute such a proceeding in the Federal Court.
 Paragraph (a) of s 478(1) stipulates that an application to the Federal Court be made in the manner specified by the Rules. At the relevant time, those Rules [O 54B r 2(1)] required that an application be in accordance with form 56. This required the applicant to describe how he or she was aggrieved by the decision, the grounds for the application, and the orders sought. That information may be acquired for use in this way by an examination of the reasons of the RRT indicated in the written statement.</text>

<text>The decision sought to be attacked by the applicant is a decision of the Tribunal. It is a decision of an administrative character. It was made pursuant to the provisions of s 500(1)(b) of the Act and was thus a decision "... made under the Act ...". For the purposes of the Act, the decision of the Tribunal was clearly a privative clause decision (see s 5(1) and s 474(2) of the Act) or a purported privative clause decision. (See s 5(1) and s 5E of the Act. See also Shuster v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 215 ; (2008) 167 FCR 186 at [5] , [13], [20], [26] and [28].)

Section 474(1) of the Act is in the following terms: 
 474 Decisions under Act are final 
 (1) A privative clause decision: 

(a) is final and conclusive; and
 
(b) must not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court; and
 
(c) is not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account.

Notwithstanding the provisions of s 474(1), s 476A of the Act invests this Court with limited original jurisdiction if (inter alia): 
 the decision is a privative clause decision, or a purported privative clause decision, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review under section 500</text>

<tocase>WACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 ; (2004) 79 ALJR 9</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/50.html</AustLII>
<text>These propositions were expressly taken up and applied by Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ in a joint judgment in WACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 at [32] and [33] (p 198); [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 79 ALJR 94 (p 100) where their Honours said: The restriction in s 478 is of a different character to that of typical statutes of limitation which operate to impose a limit of time upon an existing right of action. They operate to bar the prosecution of actions otherwise not subject to such a time limit. In that sense, statutes of limitation are preventative. However, s 478 does not "bar an existing cause of action"; rather, "[i]t imposes a condition which is of the essence of a new right". [ Australian Iron &amp; Steel Ltd v Hoogland [1962] HCA 13 ; (1962) 108 CLR 471 at 488; Rudolphy v Lightfoot [1999] HCA 61 ; (1999) 197 CLR 500 at 507 8 [10] [11]; [1999] HCA 61 ; 167 ALR 105 at 107.] Thus, s 478(1)(b) and (2) restrict what otherwise would be the conferral upon the Federal Court of jurisdiction by the parliament under ss 76(ii) and 77 (i) of the Constitution . The new jurisdiction so conferred is remedial in nature, although the remedy is confined by the time restriction upon the institution of the proceeding. The provision of information to the unsuccessful visa applicant by the RRT is a necessary step to equip the applicant with the wherewithal to institute such a proceeding in the Federal Court.
 Paragraph (a) of s 478(1) stipulates that an application to the Federal Court be made in the manner specified by the Rules. At the relevant time, those Rules [O 54B r 2(1)] required that an application be in accordance with form 56. This required the applicant to describe how he or she was aggrieved by the decision, the grounds for the application, and the orders sought. That information may be acquired for use in this way by an examination of the reasons of the RRT indicated in the written statement.

At [9] and at [37] in WACB (210 ALR at 193 and 199; 79 ALJR at 96 and 101), the majority emphasised that the Minister bore the burden of establishing lack of competency.

In order to make such findings of fact as may be required for the purpose of determining whether the applicant's application is competent or not, and for determining the applicant's latest application for leave to amend her originating process, I have found it necessary to read and to consider all of the documents in the Court file (including the transcript of directions hearings and including those documents which evidence communications between Registry staff, on the one hand, and the applicant and persons assisting her, on the other hand). I will make clear in the next section of these Reasons what regard (if any) I have paid to this material. The Procedural History of the Present Proceedings

The Tribunal's decision is dated 20 December 2007 and was handed down on that day. As I have already said, there is no first-hand evidence before me as to whether and, if so, when and in what manner that decision was actually notified to the applicant. In particular, there is no evidence from a witness or in the materials before me that the applicant attended before the Tribunal on 20 December 2007 or that she was handed a physical or hard copy of the Tribunal's decision or reasons on that day or, indeed, at any other time. The evidence before me is silent as to these matters.

There are documents in the Court file which provide a basis for drawing certain inferences as to the course of events which have led to the present application before me. However, in my judgment, that material does not provide any reliable foundation for drawing an inference that the applicant was ever handed by anyone by way of physical delivery a copy of the Tribunal's decision or of its reasons.

I will now set out my reasons for this conclusion.

In WACB [2004] HCA 50 ; 210 ALR 190 ; 79 ALJR 94 , the High Court held that similar words in s 478 of the Act (in the form in which it stood before 2001), when applied to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made pursuant to the Act, required the physical delivery to the applicant personally of the written statement (ie a hard copy thereof) which the Refugee Review Tribunal was required to prepare and to give to the parties pursuant to s 430(1) of the Act.</text>
