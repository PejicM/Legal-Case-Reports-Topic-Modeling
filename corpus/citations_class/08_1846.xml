<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<text>16 Senior Counsel for Nylex submitted that the test which I should apply in determining the present application is that which was discussed and explained in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199. Senior Counsel for Gardena did not disagree with this submission.

17 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd 208 CLR 199 , a majority of the High Court held that, where an interlocutory injunction is sought (inter alia) in respect of private rights, it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought. Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature. See [8] to [21] (pp 216 220) (per Gleeson CJ); [59] to [61] (pp 231 232) (per Gaudron J); and [86] to [92] (pp 239 242); [98] to [100] (pp 244 246); and [105] (p 248) (per Gummow and Hayne JJ). At [10] (p 216), Gleeson CJ also specifically cited with approval Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , 5 th edn, 1997 (pp 446 456).</text>

<tocase>Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/58.html</AustLII>
<text>18 In his Reasons for Judgment, at [13] (p 218), Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153:
 In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.

19 At [11] to [14] above I have summarised Gardena's claims for final relief. At [15] above I have described the claim for interlocutory relief with which these Reasons deal.

20 Gardena's interlocutory application is founded solely upon Gardena's contractual rights embodied in the Distribution Agreement. Some evidence was led concerning the misrepresentation case but no specific interlocutory relief was sought in respect of that case. Thus, the interlocutory injunction is sought in aid of Gardena's contractual rights. These rights are legal in character.

26 In light of the concessions which I have noted at [23] above, Nylex's submissions in the application before me were directed to the remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; 161 CLR 148 , namely, whether Gardena had shown that:
 
(a) it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and 
 
(b) the balance of convenience favoured the granting of an injunction.

27 The first of these matters involves an assessment by the Court as to whether the claimant would, in all material respects, be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy, as he would be in if an injunction were granted (see the discussion of this aspect in Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , 7 th edn, 2007 at pp 383 389; at pp 397 399; and at pp 457 462).

28 The second of these matters requires the Court to exercise a discretion.</text>

<tocase>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/24.html</AustLII>
<text>43 Nylex faintly argued that each of the Distribution Agreement and the Licence Agreement contained an implied term to the effect that neither party would terminate that agreement part way through the Australian summer season (ie after 1 October in any given year and before 31 March in the next year). This argument was not developed by Nylex. It was not at all clear to me how such an argument would ultimately be put. I think that Nylex will have considerable difficulty persuading the trial judge of the merits of such an argument (if it is seriously pressed at the trial). The postulated implied term is not likely to satisfy all the elements of the test approved by the High Court in Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 345 347 (per Mason J) and at 403 404 (per Brennan J). At the very least, it seems to me that the postulated implied term would contradict the terms of Clause 11.1 of the Distribution Agreement and the terms of Clause 7.2 of the Licence Agreement which clauses are, of course, express terms of the relevant contracts. I do not need to decide this point for the purposes of the application with which these Reasons deal and I refrain from doing so.

44 By letter dated 15 November 2007 sent by Nylex to Gardena Germany, Mr Peter George, who is the Executive Chairman of Nylex, acknowledged receipt of both Notices of Termination. In that letter, he also said:
 I wish you well with your integration projects and look forward to our continuing distribution of GARDENA products up to the end of next year.

45 The terms of that letter were such as to lead the recipient of it to believe that the terminations effected by the Notices of Termination were accepted by Nylex and that Nylex would approach the last year of its distribution arrangements with Gardena (viz 2008) in good faith, with goodwill and in accordance with its contractual obligations under the Distribution Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533</tocase>
<text>21 Because the expiry of the Distribution Agreement is only weeks away and because the final hearing of these proceedings will not be listed before 31 December 2008, the injunction sought by Gardena, although interlocutory in form, will have the effect of finally determining Gardena's claim for permanent injunctive relief in respect of the breach of contract constituted by Nylex's sale of competing products. For this reason, I propose to approach Gardena's claim for interlocutory relief by evaluating the strength of its claims for final relief based on that breach of contract. I do so for the purpose of ascertaining where the balance of convenience lies. I have in mind and intend to apply the statement of principle made by McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 536A D.

22 The breach of contract in respect of which a prima facie case (or serious question) is required to be demonstrated is that breach which is constituted by Nylex's conduct in marketing and selling in Australia and New Zealand non-Gardena sourced products in competition with Gardena products.

23 As I have already mentioned, Senior Counsel for Nylex conceded that there was a serious question to be tried or prima facie case in respect of that cause of action. In oral submissions he went further and conceded that Nylex had breached the Distribution Agreement by distributing and selling Nylex branded garden and domestic irrigation products in Australia and New Zealand. That conduct had been undertaken deliberately. Nylex appreciated that it was breaching the Distribution Agreement when it engaged in the conduct about which complaint is made and plainly intended to do so.</text>

<tocase>Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/30.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [65] and [66] (pp 41 43), Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (5 th edn, 1997, at pp 402 403), which may be summarised as follows: 
 
(a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances;
 
(b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and
 
(c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive.

33 Nylex had been the distributor of Gardena products in Australia and New Zealand for some years before 1990. In 1990 formal agreements were entered into.

34 By a further formal agreement styled Sole Distribution Agreement ( the Distribution Agreement ) executed on or about 10 June 1999, Gardena and Nylex entered into the current distribution arrangement. At around about the same time, those companies also entered into a Licence Agreement ( the Licence Agreement ). The Licence Agreement was intended to operate in harmony with and for the same period of time as the Distribution Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Pearson v Arcadia Stores, Guyra, Limited (No 1) [1935] HCA 41 ; (1935) 53 CLR 571</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1935/41.html</AustLII>
<text>130 Nylex cited Pearson v Arcadia Stores, Guyra, Limited (No 1) [1935] HCA 41 ; (1935) 53 CLR 571 at 583.7 and at 585 586. In that case, the High Court considered certain grounds that might be available to a party against whom an interlocutory injunction is sought as grounds for resisting the grant of such an injunction. In particular, the Court considered whether, as a matter of principle, the fact that the claimant for the interlocutory injunction is in breach of the relevant contract or some closely related contract is a matter which might go to the exercise of the Court's discretion to grant or refuse the injunction when the basis of the claim is in contract. In that context their Honours said (53 CLR at 585 586):
 It is not every failure by the covenantee to observe stipulations entered into as part of transactions in which the covenant was given that disentitles the covenantee to an injunction. If, by reason of the covenantee's own failure to perform interdependent covenants made by him, the covenant has ceased to bind the covenantor at law, there is no obligation to enforce by injunction. It is, of course, plain that in the present case the contract of service could not operate to create a collateral condition upon which the covenant depended. But there may be cases, both in covenant and in simple contract, where, although the obligation for the enforcement of which an injunction is sought continues to subsist at law, either because there has been an election to affirm, or because a right to treat the obligation as discharged did not arise, yet in equity an injunction would be refused because it would be inequitable to require the obligation to be carried out specifically by a person who has through the default of the other contracting party failed to obtain a material part of the consideration which induced him to enter into the obligation. But the present case is not of that description.

131 I do not think that it can seriously be suggested in the present case that, by breaching the Distribution Agreement, as alleged by Nylex, Gardena has denied to Nylex a material part of the consideration which induced Nylex to enter into the contract in the first place.

132 Taking Nylex's submissions at their highest, they do not warrant such a conclusion.

133 Nylex has had the benefit of the Distribution Agreement and the Licence Agreement over a long period of time. Even if everything which it asserted before me were true insofar as Gardena's recent conduct was concerned, in my view, Nylex continued to receive the benefit of those contracts throughout 2007 and 2008.

134 When one appreciates that the particular matters relied upon by Nylex have either not been proven at all or are substantially in contest, Nylex's submissions fall away.</text>
