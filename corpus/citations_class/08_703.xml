<text>15 The Senior Member then stated at [6]:
 
 In approaching the decision under the review as has been made clear by cases such as Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd and Anor [2004] FCA 843 ; (2003-4) 138 FCR 428 the question of the Applicant's fitness to practice has to be determined at the time of the making of the decision under review.

16 The Senior Member then identified at [7] the four specific allegations that were addressed in the review as follows:
 
 
 (i) The complaint by a Ms Millerd on behalf of her brother Mr Mohammed Nizam Khan, a resident of Fiji to the effect that the Applicant had not accounted to Mr Khan for monies received by way of a refund of tax overpaid following preparation of returns for Mr Khan by the Applicant, and that the Applicant had used undue pressure upon Mr Khan to induce him to withdraw his original complaint to the Respondent. 
 (ii) The volume of tax claims prepared by the Applicant. 
 (iii) The failure by the Applicant to comply with an undertaking he gave to the Respondent to close offices from which he operated at Liverpool and Harris Park and to remove all advertising. 
 (iv) The operation of an office at Dandenong in Victoria despite the Respondent in 1998 disallowing the opening of an office at that location.

17 The Senior Member then addressed the facts, dealing with these issues in reverse order.

41 I do not see any error in the AAT's approach, whatever expression of principle was to be applied. The AAT heard all the evidence. Its conclusions were directed fundamentally to the lack of integrity of the applicant. Any textual differences between the reasons of Branson J in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 843 ; (2004) 138 FCR 428 and Middleton J in Toohey [2007] FCA 431 are made irrelevant by the nature of the enquiry and the AAT's conclusions. The Senior Member, in examining past conduct and considering contested evidence, found a lack of truthfulness in the applicant and a proven lack of integrity. Any overlooking by the Senior Member of a late nomination by the applicant at the date of the AAT review was of no operative consequence to the decision.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>13 The AAT Senior Member first (at [3]-[4] of his reasons) directed himself to the meaning of "fit and proper person" by reference to the judgments of Hill J in Davies v Australian Securities Commission [1995] FCA 1496 ; (1995) 131 ALR 295 at 305 and Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 380. No complaint was made about these passages, which were as follows:
 
(a) Hill J in Davies 131 ALR at 305:
 
 The phrase "fit and proper person" is a familiar one in the context of qualifications for offices or vocations. Discussing the phrase in a context of licenses to use vehicles for the purposes of interstate trade, Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Webb JJ said in Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v The State of New South Wales (No 2) [1955] HCA 28 ; (1995) 93 CLR 127 at 156-7: 
 
 
 But their very purpose is to give the widest scope for judgment and indeed for rejection. "Fit" (or "idoneus") with respect to an office is said to involve three things: honesty, knowledge and ability: "honesty to execute it truly, without malice, affection or partiality; knowledge to know what he ought duly to do; and ability as well in estate as in body, that he may intend and execute his office, when need is, diligently, and not for impotency or poverty neglect it" Coke. When the question was whether a man was a fit and proper person to hold a licence for the sale of liquor it was considered that it ought not be confined to an inquiry into his character and that it would be unwise to attempt any definition of the matters which may legitimately be inquired into; each case must depend upon its own circumstances... 
 
 
 As I observed in Stasos v Tax Agents' Board of NSW [1990] FCA 379 ; (1990) 90 ATC 4950 at 4959, the content of what is necessary to constitute a person a fit and proper person to occupy a particular office or pursue a particular vocation will vary having regard to the office or vocation under consideration. Thus the characteristics required to show fitness as a tax agent were expressed by Davies J in Re Su and Tax Agents' Board, South Australia (1982) 82 ATC 2484 at 4286 as requiring that person to be: 
 
 
 ... a person of good reputation, has a proper knowledge of taxation laws, is able to prepare income tax returns competently and is able to deal competently with any queries which may be raised by officers of the Taxation Department. He should be a person of such competence and integrity that others may entrust their taxation affairs to his care. He should be a person of such reputation and ability that officers of the Taxation Department may proceed upon the footing that the taxation returns lodged by the agent have been prepared by him honestly and competently. 
 
 

(b) Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Bond 170 CLR at 380:
 
 The expression "fit and proper person", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of "fit and proper" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.</text>

<tocase>Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>14 The Senior Member then stated that in evaluating the four specific allegations about the applicant, he had " kept firmly in mind the fact that if I am satisfied of the Respondent's case then the Applicant will be deprived of his livelihood ". In this context, the Senior Member referred to the well-known passage in the judgment of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362.

42 The applicant submitted that the reasoning of the AAT was sufficiently illogical for it to be evident that the requirement of Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; 60 CLR 336 had not been satisfied.

43 Whilst some aspects of the reasoning of the AAT are less than pellucid (for example the content of [27] of the reasons in the circumstances of s 251K(2)(d) and s 251JC(1)(a)(i)), the Senior Member was alive to the requirement that he have regard to the serious consequences of a finding and to the consequence thereof, as required by the passage from Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; 60 CLR 336 , quoted by him. The matters in [55] of the AAT's reasons that the applicant, in effect, misled the Board about showing Ms Millerd the authority, that he exerted improper pressure upon Mr Khan to withdraw the complaint and that he sought to deceive the Board about the branch offices, were sufficiently clear and serious to warrant the conclusion reached, taking into account Briginshaw.</text>

 The expression "fit and proper person", standing alone, carries no precise meaning.

35 The AAT then concluded at [57]: 
 
 Given all the circumstances referred to above I find that the Applicant is not, in the terms described by Hill J in Davies v Australian Securities Commissions (supra) a fit and proper person and the decision under review is affirmed.

36 The two proceedings raised a number of complaints. I will deal with them as they were organised in the written submissions filed in support of both.</text>

<tocase>Minister Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>44 In the application, the applicant identified three factual matters that he said were legally irrelevant, given the principles in Minister Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24. They were:
 
 
 (a) the fact that the applicant had opened branch offices at Liverpool and Parramatta (later Harris Park) with knowledge that the respondent had informed him that such branch offices would not be approved; 
 (b) the fact that the applicant had taken no steps to notify the respondent of the existence of those said offices having regard to the requirements of reg 161 of the Income Tax Regulation 1936 (Cth) ("the regulations"); 
 (c) the fact that at the time of the decision under review the applicant had not despite stating that he would do so, lodged an application for the appointment of an additional nominee or reduced his client list;

45 These matters were not an independent foundation of a conclusion by the AAT of a lack of integrity. Indeed, the AAT itself doubted whether approval needed to be sought for the opening of offices. Rather, they were matters which went to the lack of integrity of the applicant. In particular, the first two related to a conclusion of an attempted deception of the Board. Whilst the third matter is less than cogent as to the integrity of the applicant, that is how the AAT used the matter and to that extent, it cannot be said to be legally irrelevant.

46 Section 251N of the 1936 Act was disavowed by the respondent before the AAT hearing as a basis for affirming the order. This did not, however, make irrelevant matters of behaviour of the applicant which went to his integrity.</text>

<tocase>Re Su and the Tax Agents' Board of South Australia (1982) 13 ATR 192</tocase>
<text>37 The essence of the argument of the applicant was that the AAT erred by looking at questions of honesty and integrity alone, without linking them to any asserted incompetence with respect to the preparation of income tax returns. It was submitted that the following passage from the decision of Davies J in Re Su and the Tax Agents' Board of South Australia (1982) 13 ATR 192 at 195, was to the effect that the dishonesty must reflect on a capacity to prepare tax returns and transact business on behalf of taxpayers:
 
 "... a person of good reputation, has a proper knowledge of taxation laws, is able to prepare income tax returns competently and is able to deal competently with any queries which may be raised by officers of the Taxation Department. He should be a person of such competence and integrity that others may entrust their taxation affairs to his care. He should be a person of such reputation and ability that officers of the Taxation Department may proceed upon the footing that the taxation returns lodged by the agent have been prepared by him honestly and competently."

38 I think that the submission reads too narrowly what Davies J was saying. A person may not be fit and proper in the relevant sense if his competence and skill is unchallenged but his integrity is. Competence and integrity are required. This is so because clients and the Tax Office must proceed on the basis of his competence and honesty.

39 I do not think that the reasons of the AAT betray any misunderstanding of the terms of s 251JC.</text>

<text>40 The applicant fixed upon the content of [6] of the AAT's reasons (see [15] above) in asserting an error based on what Middleton J said in Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431.

41 I do not see any error in the AAT's approach, whatever expression of principle was to be applied. The AAT heard all the evidence.
