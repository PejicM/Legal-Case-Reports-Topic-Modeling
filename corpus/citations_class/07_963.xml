<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/18.html</AustLII>
<text>464 There is a dispute as to the reach of the similar provision to s 12CA(1) contained in s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at [5] [7] per Gleeson CJ, at [38] [46] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, at [75] [77] per Kirby J, at [160] per Callinan J.

465 I do not need to enter this debate because the claim depends upon ASIC establishing that Citigroup was under a fiduciary duty to Toll, which it breached by failure to avoid the five alleged conflicts of interest. The claim fails for the reasons given above.

466 The first insider trading claim is that Citigroup, through Mr Manchee, sold 192,352 shares in Patrick, at or shortly after 3:37pm on 19 August 2005 while in possession of inside information. The inside information is said to be a supposition made by Mr Manchee at about 3:30pm during the 'cigarette on the pavement conversation' with Mr Darwell, that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the takeover of Patrick: see Further Amended Statement of Claim [143] [150].</text>

<tocase>Aequitas v Sparad No 100 Limited (formerly Australian European Finance Corporation Limited) (2001) 19 ACLC 1006</tocase>
<text>283 A fiduciary relationship arises between a financial adviser and its client where the adviser holds itself out as an expert on financial matters and undertakes to perform a financial advisory role for the client: see Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 at 377 per Gibbs CJ, 385 per Brennan J; Aequitas v Sparad No 100 Limited (formerly Australian European Finance Corporation Limited) (2001) 19 ACLC 1006 at [307] per Austin J.

284 The same principle will usually apply to financial advisers and corporate advisers. Each will owe fiduciary obligations to the client because each undertakes to act in the client's interests and not solely in its own interests: see Aequitas at [310] per Austin J. This is consistent with the principle stated by Mason J in Hospital Products at 96-97.

286 Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship. But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty: see Breen v Williams at 134 per Gummow J; Aequitas at [313] per Austin J; cf News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Hospital Products at 97 per Mason J.

325 It is true, as is shown by Daly, Hadid and Aequitas , that an adviser may have fiduciary obligations to the client. But for the express terms of the mandate letter, the pre-contract dealings between Citigroup and Toll would have pointed strongly toward the existence of a fiduciary relationship in Citigroup's role as an adviser.

326 I have set out the pre-contract dealings in some detail because they were referred to by Mr Walker and they contain all of the indicia of a fiduciary relationship of adviser and client.

327 In summary, Citigroup gave Toll advice as to the wisdom and merits of making a bid for Patrick. Citigroup gave strategic advice which involved the use of its financial acumen, judgment and expertise to further Toll's interests. Citigroup worked closely with Toll as is evidenced by the presentations made before the execution of the mandate, as well as the large number of communications between them, both oral and by email.

330 There were substantial negotiations as to the fees payable to Citigroup, and Citigroup ultimately secured success fees in the range of AUD$10 million to AUD$18 million. Fees of that order are testimony in themselves to a finding that Citigroup held itself out as an expert adviser on mergers and acquisitions, which points to the existence of a fiduciary relationship: see Daly at 377 per Gibbs CJ, 385 per Brennan J; Aequitas at [307], [310] per Austin J.

375 There is force in Citigroup's submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure. The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Aequitas at [283] [287] per Austin J; Dresna Pty Limited v Linknarf Management Services Pty Limited (In Liq) [2006] FCAFC 193 at [132] per Gyles J; P &amp; V Industries Pty Limited v Porto (No 2) [2007] VSC 64 at [29] per Hollingworth J.

376 It may follow that Brennan J's observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at [287]. ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at [70]; but I do not consider that their Honours' remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J. However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/28.html</AustLII>
<text>281 The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract, the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply. Thus, whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations, and the scope of any fiduciary duties, is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction: see Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited v Coopers Brewery Limited [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1 at [46] per Weinberg J. The same approach applies to exclusion clauses: see Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Andar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [122] per Callinan J.</text>

<tocase>Asia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited [2007] NSWSC 350</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2007/350.html</AustLII>
<text>9 Citigroup has established Chinese walls between employees who work in the private side and the public side of its business. It is apparently now more common to describe these structures by the anodyne term "information barriers": see Asia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited [2007] NSWSC 350 at [4] . I prefer the traditional description, Chinese walls.

10 The issues which arise in the present proceedings raise, at least in part, the question of whether Citigroup's Chinese walls were adequate to prevent the flow of inside information from the private side to the public side.

11 The proceedings arise out of the purchase by a public side employee of over one million shares in Patrick Corporation Limited ('Patrick') at a time when private side employees working in the IBD were acting for Citigroup's client, Toll, on a proposed takeover bid for Patrick. The shares were purchased by a trader, Mr Andrew Manchee, who worked on the proprietary trading desk which is situated in Equity Derivatives, within the Equities Division.

321 A reminder that Chinese walls may sometimes be porous is to be found in the recent decision of Bergin J in Asia Pacific v Optus.

322 The authorities to which I have referred above at [276] [281] make it clear that the question of whether any fiduciary relationship existed between Citigroup and Toll is to be determined by the proper construction of the mandate letter.</text>

<text>287 The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will extend must be determined by the character of the venture or undertaking: see Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408 per Dixon J; United Dominions v Brian at 13 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ. This is to be ascertained from the terms of the agreement and the course of dealing between the parties: see News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Australian Breeders Co-operative Society Limited v Jones (1997) 150 ALR 488 at 514 per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ; Beach Petroleum NL v Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 1 at [194] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA.

289 The distinguishing or over-riding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty: see Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Limited v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] per Finn J; Beach Petroleum at [201] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA; Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1 at 18 per Millett LJ.

313 Further support may be found in the discussion of the authorities by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum at [199] [206] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA. The duty of a fiduciary is one of undivided loyalty. The "no conflict" rule is based on practical considerations and recognises that the fiduciary's over-riding duty may be swayed by a conflicting interest. The existence of a Chinese wall cannot, of itself, overcome the prohibition against a fiduciary acting at the same time both for and against the same client. Indeed, it exposes the vice to which Professor Finn referred.

314 However, as the UK Law Commission observed, a financial conglomerate may obtain protection against any allegation of breach of the duty of loyalty if the client consents to the company carrying on business using Chinese walls as part of its organisational structure. The extent of the duty of loyalty would then be determined according to the contractual arrangements between the parties: see Law Commission Consultation Paper at [4.5.1].

335 It is true, as Frankfurter J said in Securities and Exchange Commission v Chenery Corporation 318 US 80 (1942) at 85, that "to say a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis": see the citation in Beach Petroleum at [185] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA. But it is otherwise where the parties acknowledge that they are not in a fiduciary relationship. In my view, those words mean what they say and should be enforced accordingly, unless the mandate letter was vitiated as a matter of law.

365 Brickenden has been followed in this Court in CBA v Smith at 394 per Davies, Sheppard and Gummow JJ. It has also been followed and explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum at [435] [450] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA.

366 Their Honours said in Beach Petroleum at [444] that Brickenden is not authority for the general proposition that in no case involving breach of fiduciary duty may a court consider what would have happened if the duty had been performed. This is because Brickenden is now to be understood in light of the decision of the House of Lords in Target Holdings Limited v Redferns [1996] 1 AC 421. Their Lordships there said at 439 that causation is to be determined using commonsense and hindsight: see Beach Petroleum at [432] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA. I respectfully agree with the views of the Court of Appeal.

368 I do not need to decide the issue of causation. ASIC's submissions assumed, contrary to my finding, that Citigroup and Toll were in a fiduciary relationship. Whilst the issue of causation does not need to be determined, it seems to me that in light of the observations of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum , ASIC's submission that "the expectations, or inclination to give permission of the beneficiary Toll are irrelevant", should be rejected.

369 ASIC alleges five separate breaches of fiduciary duty by Citigroup. These claims fail because I have come to the view that Citigroup was not in a fiduciary relationship with Toll. Nevertheless, I will address each of the five alleged conflicts because there are other reasons why those claims would fail even if Citigroup did owe fiduciary duties to Toll.

370 I will deal with the five "conflicts" in the order in which they were pleaded. All of them are said to be conflicts of interest and duty.</text>

<text>287 The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will extend must be determined by the character of the venture or undertaking: see Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408 per Dixon J; United Dominions v Brian at 13 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

<tocase>Boughey v The Queen [1986] HCA 29 ; (1986) 161 CLR 10</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/29.html</AustLII>
<text>427 Citigroup's advice was given to Toll which was a person who was, or was "likely to become, an interested party" in Patrick: see Reg 7.1.29(3)(c)(i). In my view, in this context "likely" means a real and not remote chance: see for example Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; Boughey v The Queen [1986] HCA 29 ; (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 21 per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ. It seems to me that Toll's past record of success in takeover bids, its core competence in the field, and the planning and effort which went into this bid made it likely, even as at 8 August 2005, that Toll would become an interested party within the meaning stated in the authorities.</text>

<tocase>Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 QB 606</tocase>
<text>392 As Lord Upjohn said in Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 QB 606 at 637-638, there must be a "real conflict of duty and interest and not some theoretical or rhetorical conflict".

393 The fourth conflict, as pleaded at [79] [88] of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, is that it was in the interests of Toll that the price of Patrick shares not go up during trading on 19 August 2005.

394 By placing itself in this position of conflict, Citigroup is said to have breached its fiduciary duty to Toll. The claim fails because of the absence of a fiduciary relationship but I will deal with the other elements of the claim contained in the pleading.</text>

<tocase>Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/63.html</AustLII>
<text>270 As Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 106, "Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a general test for determining when persons [...] stand in a fiduciary relationship". It may be, as their Honours said, that the term "fiduciary relationship" defies definition. This is because of the difficulty of stating a comprehensive principle suitable for application to different types of relationships that carry different obligations: see Hospital Products at 69 per Gibbs CJ; News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 538 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

277 The observations of Gummow J in Breen v Williams at 132-133 are to the same effect. But his Honour also pointed out that a contractual term may be so precise in its regulation of what a party may do that there is no scope for the creation of a fiduciary duty.

278 It follows from these statements of principle that it is open to the parties to a contract to exclude or modify the operation of fiduciary duties. This was the view of the Law Commission Consultation Paper which was reached after a careful examination of the authorities: see at [3.3.12].

286 Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship. But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty: see Breen v Williams at 134 per Gummow J; Aequitas at [313] per Austin J; cf News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Hospital Products at 97 per Mason J.

290 In Australia, the duty of loyalty is proscriptive rather than prescriptive in nature: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer v Duke Group Limited (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

311 Indeed, this is a distinction which is recognised in s 912A(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act . It imposes a duty upon a financial services licensee to have in place adequate arrangements for "the management of conflicts of interest". The statutory requirement is to be contrasted with the duty in equity of a fiduciary to eliminate or avoid conflicts: see Breen v Williams at 108 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ. Of course, one way of managing conflicts would be to eliminate them but s 912A(1)(aa) does not require a licensee to take that step: see the discussion by Mr Tuch, 29 MULR at 514-515.

312 Support for the proposition that Chinese walls do not eliminate conflicts may be found in the Law Commission Consultation Paper . At [4.5.1], the UK Law Commission referred to a paper by Professor Finn, "Fiduciary Law and the Modern Commercial World", Norton Rose Oxford Law Colloquium (1991) at p 13. Professor Finn pointed out that the vice is not the possibility of misuse of confidential information but, rather the "compromising of a fiduciary's duty of loyalty."

375 There is force in Citigroup's submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure. The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Aequitas at [283] [287] per Austin J; Dresna Pty Limited v Linknarf Management Services Pty Limited (In Liq) [2006] FCAFC 193 at [132] per Gyles J; P &amp; V Industries Pty Limited v Porto (No 2) [2007] VSC 64 at [29] per Hollingworth J.</text>

<tocase>Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co [1934] 3 DLR 465</tocase>
<text>364 This submission was said to be supported by the decision of the Privy Council in Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co [1934] 3 DLR 465 at 469 per Lord Thankerton. His Lordship there said that once the court has determined that the non-disclosed facts are material, speculation as to what course the beneficiary would have taken, if disclosure had been made, is not relevant.

365 Brickenden has been followed in this Court in CBA v Smith at 394 per Davies, Sheppard and Gummow JJ. It has also been followed and explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum at [435] [450] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA.

<text>468 The standard of proof of the claim is the balance of probabilities but I must take into account the gravity of the matters alleged: see s 140(2)(c) of the Evidence Act . This would appear to correspond with common law principles so that the well known test stated in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 applies: see Heydon JD, Cross on Evidence (7 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2004) at [9130]; cf Odgers S, Uniform Evidence Law (7 th ed, LawBook Co, 2006) at [1.4.100].

<tocase>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1</tocase>
<text>289 The distinguishing or over-riding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty: see Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Limited v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] per Finn J; Beach Petroleum at [201] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA; Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1 at 18 per Millett LJ.

292 The nature of the fiduciary obligation is encapsulated in the following remarks of Millett LJ in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew at 18:
 "The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary. As Dr. Finn pointed out in his classic work Fiduciary Obligations (1977), p. 2, he is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary."</text>

<text>279 That view is supported by both Australian and English authority: see Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 196 per Deane J; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Noranda Australia Limited v Lachlan Resources NL (1988) 14 NSWLR 1 at 17 per Bryson J; Woolworths Limited v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 at 225 per Mahoney JA; Kelly v Cooper [1993] AC 205 at 213-214 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. See also Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited [1994] UKHL 5 ; [1995] 2 AC 145 at 206 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.

291 This duty embodies "the twin themes" of preventing undisclosed conflict of duty and interest (or of duty and duty), and of prohibiting misuse of the fiduciary position: see Chan v Zacharia at 198-199 per Deane J; Gibson Motorsport at [12] per Finn J.

323 In Chan v Zacharia , Deane J said in plain terms at 196 that the parties to a partnership agreement could provide "that any fiduciary relationship between the partners was excluded." The observations of Mahoney JA in Woolworths v Kelly at [225] were to the same effect. His Honour said that fiduciary duties could be "varied or released" by contract. Also, in News Limited , a Full Court of this Court (Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ) said at 539 that whether there are any fiduciary obligations at all may depend on the terms of the contract.</text>

385 The other person identified in the particulars, Mr Little, was not called by ASIC to give evidence. The plain inference is that his evidence would not have assisted.

386 The third conflict is said to have arisen because it was likely that the fact that Citigroup had acquired "such a substantial body of shares" would come to the notice of private side employees providing corporate advisory services, namely Mr Dempsey and his team, or to those providing investment banking services, namely Mr Bartels and his team, or their superiors, Mr Roberts and Mr Sinclair, or the Compliance department and in-house lawyers: see Further Amended Statement of Claim [75].</text>

<tocase>Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Bracht [1989] VR 821</tocase>
<text>488 It is also important to bear in mind that, as is noted in Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [8.020], the origin of the extended definition of "officer" is to be found in Parliament codifying, at least in part, the principles stated by Ormiston J in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Bracht [1989] VR 821.

489 In Bracht , Ormiston J considered the proper construction of s 227 of the Companies (Victoria) Code which prohibited a person who was bankrupt from taking part in the management of a corporation. His Honour considered at 830 that the concept of "management" comprehended:
 "activities which involve policy and decision-making, related to the business affairs of a corporation, affecting the corporation as a whole or a substantial part of that corporation, to the extent that the consequences of the formation of those policies or the making of those decisions may have some significant bearing on the financial standing of the corporation or the conduct of its affairs".

490 The language of subparagraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of the definition of "officer" corresponds, in large measure, with Ormiston J's description of the concept of management. What emerges from this is that an officer is involved in policy making and decisions that affect the whole or a substantial part of the business of the corporation.

491 Moreover, this is reflected in the distinction drawn in the Corporations Act between officers and employees and it is supported by authorities that have considered the statutory definition.

496 It is true, of course, that the meaning of "officer" must be considered in its particular statutory context: see for example Bracht at 827-828 per Ormiston J. Duties of honesty, care and diligence are imposed on officers by ss 180 184 of the Corporations Act . But it seems to me that, if anything, this reinforces the view I have expressed as to the requirement that an officer occupy a management role.

497 In my view, Mr Manchee did not fall within either subparagraph (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of the definition of "officer". ASIC has not established that he had any involvement in policy making or decisions that affected the whole or a substantial part of the business of Citigroup. Mr Manchee was one of five proprietary traders employed by Citigroup. There was no evidence that anyone reported to him or that he had any responsibilities apart from proprietary trading.

498 The proprietary trading desk is one of four trading desks in the Equity Derivatives Division which is itself a subdivision of Equities, one of six divisions in the CIB. The CIB is one of Citigroup's three businesses. Mr Manchee's trading was subject to daily limits and to the direction of his risk manager, Mr Darwell.</text>

<text>532 The amendment was explained in [319] [320] of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 (Cth) as follows:
 "[319] Doubt was also expressed as to whether the term 'information' would be interpreted as encompassing supposition, intentions and other matter not sufficiently certain to require its release to the public, notwithstanding the broad interpretation given to the term in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green [1978] VR 505 at 511. 
 Proposed amendment 
 [320] Proposed section 1002A(1) provides definitions of 'information' and 'securities', in relation to a body corporate, to apply for the purposes of the insider trading provisions. The definition of information is an inclusive one, with information being taken to include supposition and other matters insufficiently definite to warrant being made known to the public and matters relating to the intentions, or likely intentions, of a person."

534 It is also apparent that the new definition was to include in the concept of information, factual knowledge obtained by means of a hint or veiled suggestion from which the receiver of it can impute other knowledge: see Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green [1978] VR 505 at 511.</text>

Thus, a bank which gives its customers financial advice in the course of a transaction that includes an advance of money to the client may be in a fiduciary relationship with the client in its role as adviser. The bank may be expected to act in its own interests in ensuring the security for the loan but it will undertake fiduciary obligations to the client if it creates an expectation that it will advise in the customer's interests on the wisdom of the investment: see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith (1993) 42 FCR 390 at 391 per Davies, Sheppard and Gummow JJ.

<tocase>D &amp; J Constructions Pty Limited v Head &amp; ors trading as Clayton Utz (1987) 9 NSWLR 118</tocase>
<text>320 Nevertheless, warnings have been sounded in other authorities about the risk of leakage through Chinese walls. Thus, for example, Bryson J said in D &amp; J Constructions Pty Limited v Head &amp; ors trading as Clayton Utz (1987) 9 NSWLR 118 at 123:
 " ...it is not realistic to place reliance on such arrangements in relation to people with opportunities for daily contact over long periods, as wordless communication can take place inadvertently and without explicit expression, by attitudes, facial expression or even by avoiding people one is accustomed to see, even by people who sincerely intend to conform to control."

453 Nevertheless, having seen Mr Monaci in the witness box, it seems to me that the warning sounded by Bryson J in D &amp; J Constructions is apt. That is to say, it is not always realistic to place reliance on arrangements comprising Chinese walls: see [320] above.

454 Adequate arrangements require more than a raft of written policies and procedures. They require a thorough understanding of the procedures by all employees and a willingness and ability to apply them to a host of possible conflicts.

455 Mr Monaci's entire statement was the result of reflection by him in hindsight which he did not take into account in the particular circumstances that arose on 19 August 2006. The 83 page statement was prepared for him in draft by his solicitors and adopted by him.</text>

<tocase>Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/25.html</AustLII>
<text>283 A fiduciary relationship arises between a financial adviser and its client where the adviser holds itself out as an expert on financial matters and undertakes to perform a financial advisory role for the client: see Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Limited [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 at 377 per Gibbs CJ, 385 per Brennan J; Aequitas v Sparad No 100 Limited (formerly Australian European Finance Corporation Limited) (2001) 19 ACLC 1006 at [307] per Austin J.

330 There were substantial negotiations as to the fees payable to Citigroup, and Citigroup ultimately secured success fees in the range of AUD$10 million to AUD$18 million. Fees of that order are testimony in themselves to a finding that Citigroup held itself out as an expert adviser on mergers and acquisitions, which points to the existence of a fiduciary relationship: see Daly at 377 per Gibbs CJ, 385 per Brennan J; Aequitas at [307], [310] per Austin J.

371 The first conflict is said to have arisen once Citigroup acquired its own interest in Patrick shares on 19 August 2005. Citigroup is then said to have had a fiduciary duty to disclose to Toll, as its adviser, all relevant knowledge in relation to decisions to be made by Toll about the bid. The duty is said to be based on the decision of the High Court in Daly , in particular the reasons of Brennan J at 385.

372 The duty of disclosure pleaded in the first conflict is said to be a duty to furnish Toll with all relevant knowledge possessed by Mr Bartels which may reasonably be regarded as relevant to the making of Toll's decision as to whether the premium for the bid should be marketed by reference to the closing price of Patrick shares on Friday, 19 August 2005 or the closing price on Thursday, 18 August 2005: see Further Amended Statement of Claim [59].

373 It is then said that it was relevant for Toll, when making a decision as to how to market the bid, to know that the market activity in Patrick shares on 19 August 2005 "had been materially contributed to by Citigroup's own actions" in acquiring its stake in Patrick for the purpose of making profits for itself: see Further Amended Statement of Claim [60].

376 It may follow that Brennan J's observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at [287]. ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at [70]; but I do not consider that their Honours' remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J. However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level.

379 The second conflict, as with the first, also raises the question of whether Australian law recognises the positive duty to furnish information consistently with that stated in Daly .

380 The second conflict is said to arise from the following knowledge, as at about 7pm on 19 August 2005, on the part of Messrs Roberts, Sinclair, Monaci and Scott: 
 
 
 &#8722; that Mr Dempsey and the private side employees of Citigroup in the IBD who were assisting him, were advising Toll on the bid;
 &#8722; that Citigroup had acquired a substantial shareholding in Patrick on its own account on 19 August 2005;
 &#8722; that they were concerned about how the acquisition of Citigroup's stake would be perceived by Toll and by the market;
 &#8722; that there was a perception that Toll and the market might infer that Citigroup's Chinese walls had failed.

381 Citigroup is then said to have had a duty (through Messrs Roberts, Sinclair, Monaci and Scott) to inform Toll that it had engaged in substantial trading in Patrick shares on 19 August 2005. Thus Citigroup is said to have had a conflict of interest and duty: see Further Amended Statement of Claim [66], [70].

461 Both counts of misleading or deceptive conduct are founded upon a fiduciary duty to disclose in accordance with Daly. The claims fail in the absence of any finding of fiduciary relationship between Citigroup and Toll and particularly my rejection of any Daly duty in the circumstances of the present case.

462 Section 12CA(1) of the ASIC Act prohibits conduct in relation to financial services if the conduct is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law.

463 ASIC contends that by being in the five alleged positions of conflict, Citigroup breached its fiduciary duty to Toll and that each breach of fiduciary duty was unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law of a State or Territory.</text>

<text>281 The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract, the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply. Thus, whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations, and the scope of any fiduciary duties, is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction: see Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited v Coopers Brewery Limited [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1 at [46] per Weinberg J. The same approach applies to exclusion clauses: see Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Andar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [122] per Callinan J.</text>

<text>296 The sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom disclosure is required to be made: see Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Limited [2007] HCA 22 at [107] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.

297 The authorities which deal with time charging by solicitors reveal a special instance where a solicitor has a conflict between his or her own interest in earning fees, and the duty to the client. A central question in these proceedings is whether the principles stated in the authorities on solicitors apply where the alleged fiduciary relationship is not one of the established categories.

355 Citigroup did not obtain Toll's express consent to trade on its own account in the context of its advisory role in the Patrick takeover, but in my view informed consent is to be implied from Toll's knowledge of Citigroup's structure and method of operations. Toll's experience and "core competency" in mergers and acquisitions must also be taken into account in determining this question: see Farah at [107] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.

356 Although Mr Chatfield would have preferred Citigroup not to trade on its own behalf, he knew that Citigroup was a large financial conglomerate which did not act exclusively for Toll. He also knew that Citigroup had a proprietary trading desk which could operate for the benefit of Citigroup so long as knowledge of Toll's confidential information did not leak to the proprietary traders.

357 It is true that Mr Chatfield did not turn his mind to the question of whether Citigroup would suspend its proprietary trading during the period of the mandate, but the effect of his evidence was that he accepted that Citigroup could trade for third parties or for itself, so long as it did not use Toll's confidential information.</text>

<text>427 Citigroup's advice was given to Toll which was a person who was, or was "likely to become, an interested party" in Patrick: see Reg 7.1.29(3)(c)(i). In my view, in this context "likely" means a real and not remote chance: see for example Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; Boughey v The Queen [1986] HCA 29 ; (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 21 per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ. It seems to me that Toll's past record of success in takeover bids, its core competence in the field, and the planning and effort which went into this bid made it likely, even as at 8 August 2005, that Toll would become an interested party within the meaning stated in the authorities.</text>

<tocase>Hooker Investments Pty Limited v Baring Bros Halkertson &amp; Partners Securities Limited (1986) 10 ACLR 462</tocase>
<text>535 This approach to construction has been adopted in relation to s 128 of the Securities Industry Act 1980 (NSW), the successor to s 75A of the Securities Industry Act and precursor to s 1002A of the Corporations Act 1989 : see Hooker Investments Pty Limited v Baring Bros Halkertson &amp; Partners Securities Limited (1986) 10 ACLR 462 at 467-468 per Young J; R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 ; (2004) 184 FLR 365 at [126] [127] per Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J. As Young J said in Hooker Investments v Baring Bros, at 468, information goes further than knowledge and:
 "may include a rumour that something has happened with respect to a company which a person neither believes nor disbelieves".

537 In my view it follows from what was said by McInerney J in CCA v Green , by Young J in Hooker Investments v Baring Bros and by Barr and Hall JJ in Hannes v DPP that information can be non-specific and that what is drawn from it by way of inference is also included within the statutory definition of information. Moreover, the information, whether in the form of a hint or a rumour, must be communicated orally or by conduct, for example by observation of the words or conduct of others.

538 It also seems to follow from this that an inference may be a supposition or a matter of supposition, and therefore falls within the definition of information in s 1042A. The supposition would therefore be that which the person drew from the hint or other non-specific information received from another.

539 It was submitted on behalf of Citigroup that the legislative history shows that the inclusive definition of "information" in s 1042A of the Corporations Act was not intended to extend the ordinary meaning of the word "information" to encompass uncommunicated thought processes.</text>

<tocase>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1984/64.html</AustLII>
<text>17 In Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 97, Mason J said that where a contractual relationship provides the foundation for the erection of a fiduciary relationship, the contract regulates the rights and liabilities of the parties. His Honour went on to say that the fiduciary relationship, "if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to", the contractual terms.

18 How then, to use the language of Mason J in Hospital Products , can a fiduciary relationship be superimposed upon the mandate letter in the face of clear language which excludes it?

21 Citigroup disputes the applicability of ten of the eleven propositions propounded by ASIC. It submits that because the mandate letter provides so precisely that no fiduciary relationship exists between Citigroup and Toll, there is simply no scope for the mandate to accommodate a fiduciary relationship. It submits that the propositions put forward by ASIC to overcome this difficulty have no application particularly when the fiduciary relationship is not one of the 'per se' relationships referred to in the authorities: see for example Hospital Products at 96 per Mason J.

22 The substance of Citigroup's answer to the claim is that the duty of a fiduciary to obtain the informed consent of a client has no application here because it presupposes the existence of an antecedent fiduciary relationship. No such pre-existing relation is claimed to have been created.

23 Citigroup also relies, to the extent necessary, upon events preceding (and post-dating) the execution of the mandate letter, as demonstrating Toll's knowledge of, and informed consent to, Citigroup's proprietary trading in Patrick shares. These events include the submission by Citigroup to one of the Toll companies, Toll Transport Pty Limited ('Toll Transport'), and subsequent execution, of a Custodian &amp; Nominee Appointment Agreement dated 23 June 2005. That contract deals with the acquisition by Citigroup of a discreet pre-bid stake in Patrick for and on behalf of Toll. This contract contained express disclosure of Citigroup's right to trade as principal in Patrick shares.

270 As Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 106, "Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a general test for determining when persons [...] stand in a fiduciary relationship". It may be, as their Honours said, that the term "fiduciary relationship" defies definition. This is because of the difficulty of stating a comprehensive principle suitable for application to different types of relationships that carry different obligations: see Hospital Products at 69 per Gibbs CJ; News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 538 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

271 The courts have recognised certain classes of persons as falling within established categories of fiduciary relationships. Examples of these include trustee and beneficiary, agent and principal, solicitor and client, director and company, employee and employer, and partners: see Hospital Products at 68 per Gibbs CJ, at 96 per Mason J.

272 Apart from the established categories, perhaps the most than can be said is that a fiduciary relationship exists where a person has undertaken to act in the interests of another and not in his or her own interests but all of the facts and circumstances must be carefully examined to see whether the relationship is, in substance, fiduciary: see Hospital Products at 71-72 per Gibbs CJ; News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

276 In Hospital Products, Mason J observed at 97 that "contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist". His Honour said that if a fiduciary relationship is to exist between parties to a contract, the fiduciary relationship must conform to the terms of the contract. He went on to say that:
 "The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction."

284 The same principle will usually apply to financial advisers and corporate advisers. Each will owe fiduciary obligations to the client because each undertakes to act in the client's interests and not solely in its own interests: see Aequitas at [310] per Austin J. This is consistent with the principle stated by Mason J in Hospital Products at 96-97.

286 Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship. But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty: see Breen v Williams at 134 per Gummow J; Aequitas at [313] per Austin J; cf News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Hospital Products at 97 per Mason J.

288 The scope of the fiduciary duties will vary and is to be determined according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the case: see Hospital Products at 69 per Gibbs CJ, 102 per Mason J.

390 Moreover, there is force in Citigroup's submission that the alleged conflict of interest is too remote. There must be "a conflict or a real or substantial possibility of a conflict": see Hospital Products at 103 per Mason J. In fact , Mason J went even further at 104, quoting the statement of Judge Learned Hand in Phelan v Middle States Oil Corporation (1955) 220 F (2d) 593 at 602-603 that the conflict rule does not apply:
 "... not only when the putative interest, though in itself strong enough to be an inducement, was too remote, but also when, though not too remote, it was too feeble an inducement to be a determining motive".</text>

359 I do not consider that the circumstances of the present case are identical with those of Kelly v Cooper where the Privy Council held that there was to be implied in a contract with a real estate agent, a term that the agent was free to act for other principals selling similar properties. Such a term was implied because the practice is notorious and it would otherwise be impossible for the estate agents to perform their ordinary business functions: see Kelly v Cooper at 214 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.

360 In my opinion, there is nothing in the relationship of investment banker/financial advisor and client which requires a conclusion that it is an inherent part of the business of investment banking for the banker to engage in trading in its client's target's shares.

361 But, in my opinion, in the particular circumstances of this case, for the reasons given above, Toll had sufficient knowledge of the real possibility of proprietary trading by Citigroup to amount to informed consent.

362 Citigroup relied upon the concession made by Mr Chatfield in cross-examination that if on 19 August 2005 Citigroup had told him it had engaged in proprietary trading "it wouldn't have made any difference" to the decisions which Toll made: see [232] above.

363 ASIC sought to meet this by submitting that a fiduciary who has not obtained informed consent does not escape the consequences of that failure by showing that the information which was not disclosed would not, as a matter of fact, and with hindsight, have affected the client's decision.</text>

<tocase>Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408</tocase>
<text>19 ASIC's answer to this conundrum is to be found in eleven propositions to which I will refer later. At the heart of them is the proposition that where the inclusion of a particular term in a contract between a fiduciary and client would create an actual or potential conflict of interest between the fiduciary and the client, the fiduciary must obtain the client's informed consent to the inclusion of that provision. This approach to the question builds, in large measure, analogically upon principles applicable to solicitors: see in particular the observations of Mahoney JA in Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408 at 435-436.

20 The gravamen of ASIC's case is that for the exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the mandate letter to be effective, it was incumbent upon Citigroup to draw Toll's attention expressly to the effect of the exclusion, that is, that it permitted Citigroup to trade in Patrick shares on its own account, in potential conflict with the interests of Toll.

298 A solicitor who wishes to enter into a time charging costs agreement with the client must make full disclosure to the client of all the implications of such an agreement: see Foreman at 435-437 per Mahoney JA; Re Morris Fletcher v Cross' Bill of Costs [1997] 2 Qd R 228 at 243 per Fryberg J; McNamara Business &amp; Property Law v Kasmeridis [2007] SASC 90 at [28] [31] per Doyle CJ.

300 In Foreman , Mahoney JA said at 435 that fiduciary obligations, including full disclosure, exist not only in the carrying out of an agreement already made between a solicitor and client "but also in respect of the making of it."

301 Mr Walker submitted that this observation by Mahoney JA indicates that the disclosure obligation applies to the making of a contract where a person who would otherwise be in a fiduciary relationship seeks to exclude fiduciary obligations in the terms of the contract.

302 However, I do not consider that this submission provides an answer to the conundrum presented by the apparent exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the present case. There are two reasons for this.

304 Indeed, in Foreman at 435, Mahoney JA specifically pointed out that a solicitor is in a fiduciary position vis-&agrave;-vis the client and/or in a position of influence. Hence the need for the solicitor to give the client advice that would enable a proper understanding of the operation and effect of a time based costs agreement: see McNamara at [28] per Doyle CJ.

344 This submission is said to be based upon the principles stated in the authorities dealing with time charging by solicitors: see Foreman and the other authorities referred to at [298] [300] above. ASIC submitted that the principle is not limited to solicitors and applies generally to all fiduciaries.

345 However, for reasons given above at [303] [306], I do not consider that this principle applies in the present case. In particular, even if the principle stated by Mahoney JA in Foreman is of general application to fiduciaries, it cannot apply unless the fiduciary is within an established category or is subject to fiduciary obligations before entering into the contract.

346 To hold otherwise would be to say that a person who is not a fiduciary may nevertheless owe an obligation which flows from a fiduciary relationship. That could hardly be correct.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/144.html</AustLII>
<text>281 The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract, the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply. Thus, whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations, and the scope of any fiduciary duties, is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction: see Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited v Coopers Brewery Limited [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1 at [46] per Weinberg J. The same approach applies to exclusion clauses: see Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Andar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [122] per Callinan J.</text>

<text>298 A solicitor who wishes to enter into a time charging costs agreement with the client must make full disclosure to the client of all the implications of such an agreement: see Foreman at 435-437 per Mahoney JA; Re Morris Fletcher v Cross' Bill of Costs [1997] 2 Qd R 228 at 243 per Fryberg J; McNamara Business &amp; Property Law v Kasmeridis [2007] SASC 90 at [28] [31] per Doyle CJ.

299 This principle applies whether or not the costs agreement is made before the solicitor is instructed: see Symonds v Raphael [1998] FamCA 165 ; (1998) 148 FLR 171 at 186-187 per Baker and Burton JJ; see also McNamara at [38] per Doyle CJ. The reason given in those authorities for the proposition that the solicitor must make full disclosure even before the contract of retainer is that the fiduciary relationship may arise before the solicitor is actually retained: see United Dominions v Brian at 11-12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.

303 First, the authorities dealing with solicitors' costs agreements have, as their foundation, the Court's inherent jurisdiction over solicitors and the fiduciary nature of the solicitor and client relationship as an established fiduciary category: see McNamara at [29] per Doyle CJ.

304 Indeed, in Foreman at 435, Mahoney JA specifically pointed out that a solicitor is in a fiduciary position vis-&agrave;-vis the client and/or in a position of influence. Hence the need for the solicitor to give the client advice that would enable a proper understanding of the operation and effect of a time based costs agreement: see McNamara at [28] per Doyle CJ.</text>

Thus, a bank which gives its customers financial advice in the course of a transaction that includes an advance of money to the client may be in a fiduciary relationship with the client in its role as adviser.

<tocase>News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410</tocase>
<text>270 As Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed in Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 ; (1996) 186 CLR 71 at 106, "Australian courts have consciously refrained from attempting to provide a general test for determining when persons [...] stand in a fiduciary relationship". It may be, as their Honours said, that the term "fiduciary relationship" defies definition. This is because of the difficulty of stating a comprehensive principle suitable for application to different types of relationships that carry different obligations: see Hospital Products at 69 per Gibbs CJ; News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 538 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

272 Apart from the established categories, perhaps the most than can be said is that a fiduciary relationship exists where a person has undertaken to act in the interests of another and not in his or her own interests but all of the facts and circumstances must be carefully examined to see whether the relationship is, in substance, fiduciary: see Hospital Products at 71-72 per Gibbs CJ; News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ.

275 Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ considered that these remarks contain an important question "if not the question": see News Limited at 541. La Forest J also agreed with Professor Finn's remarks in Lac Minerals Limited v International Corona Resources Limited (1989) 61 DLR (4th) 14 at 26.

279 That view is supported by both Australian and English authority: see Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 196 per Deane J; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Noranda Australia Limited v Lachlan Resources NL (1988) 14 NSWLR 1 at 17 per Bryson J; Woolworths Limited v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 at 225 per Mahoney JA; Kelly v Cooper [1993] AC 205 at 213-214 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. See also Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited [1994] UKHL 5 ; [1995] 2 AC 145 at 206 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.

286 Vulnerability of the client is one of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship. But this would appear to flow from the special opportunity of the adviser to abuse the expectation of loyalty: see Breen v Williams at 134 per Gummow J; Aequitas at [313] per Austin J; cf News Limited at 541 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Hospital Products at 97 per Mason J.

287 The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will extend must be determined by the character of the venture or undertaking: see Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408 per Dixon J; United Dominions v Brian at 13 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ. This is to be ascertained from the terms of the agreement and the course of dealing between the parties: see News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Australian Breeders Co-operative Society Limited v Jones (1997) 150 ALR 488 at 514 per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ; Beach Petroleum NL v Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 1 at [194] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA.

323 In Chan v Zacharia , Deane J said in plain terms at 196 that the parties to a partnership agreement could provide "that any fiduciary relationship between the partners was excluded." The observations of Mahoney JA in Woolworths v Kelly at [225] were to the same effect. His Honour said that fiduciary duties could be "varied or released" by contract. Also, in News Limited , a Full Court of this Court (Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ) said at 539 that whether there are any fiduciary obligations at all may depend on the terms of the contract.</text>

<text>290 In Australia, the duty of loyalty is proscriptive rather than prescriptive in nature: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer v Duke Group Limited (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

375 There is force in Citigroup's submission that Australian law does not recognise a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure. The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information: see Breen v Williams at 113 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 137-138 per Gummow J; Pilmer at [74] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Aequitas at [283] [287] per Austin J; Dresna Pty Limited v Linknarf Management Services Pty Limited (In Liq) [2006] FCAFC 193 at [132] per Gyles J; P &amp; V Industries Pty Limited v Porto (No 2) [2007] VSC 64 at [29] per Hollingworth J.

376 It may follow that Brennan J's observations in Daly are to be confined in the manner discussed by Austin J in Aequitas at [287]. ASIC asserted that Daly was referred to by the High Court in Pilmer without disapproval at [70]; but I do not consider that their Honours' remarks amounted to a clear acceptance of the reasoning of Brennan J. However I do not need to consider this question because in my view the claim fails at a factual level.

391 Support for the view that the interests identified in the present case were too remote is also to be found in the remarks of the majority in Pilmer at [83] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Their Honours said that it is not sufficient to say generally "that there was a hope or expectation of future dealings". Most professional advisers would hope, as their Honours said, that the proper performance of the task would lead the client to retain them again.</text>

<tocase>Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222</tocase>
<text>308 A favoured technique for dealing with conflicts of interest which arise from the carrying on of business by large financial institutions is the use of Chinese walls. They are widely used by institutions in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada: see Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222 at 238 per Lord Millett; see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at [4.5].

309 Chinese walls are a means of restricting the flow of information between different departments of the same organisation: see Bolkiah at 238 per Lord Millett; see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at [4.5.1].

310 In Bolkiah at 238, Lord Millett described Chinese walls as a technique for "managing" conflicts of interest. The use of this word is significant because it suggests that Chinese walls do not eliminate conflicts; they are no more than a technique for managing conflicts of interests which continue to exist.

316 Cases dealing with claims brought by former clients of solicitors and accountants to restrain the firm from acting against it show a willingness by the courts to accept the concept of Chinese walls as a means of quarantining information within the firm: see Bolkiah at 237-238 per Lord Millett; Photocure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2002) 56 IPR 86 at [61] per Goldberg J.

317 The relief sought in those cases turned upon the question of whether there was a risk of disclosure or misuse of confidential information. Lord Millett said in Bolkiah at 237-238 that there is no rule of law that Chinese walls are insufficient to eliminate the risk of disclosure but the Court should restrain the firm from acting unless satisfied that effective measures have been taken to prevent disclosure.

318 Thus, the question of whether Chinese walls are effective will be a question of fact in each case, although Lord Millett emphasised that the wall must be "an established part of the organisational structure", not created ad hoc : see Bolkiah at 239. The same approach must be taken in determining whether Chinese walls constitute adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest within s 912(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act .

319 In Bolkiah, Lord Millett at 238 drew upon the observations in the Law Commission Consultation Paper to illustrate the type of organisational arrangements which would ordinarily be effective: see also Law Commission Consultation Paper at [4.5.2]. These are: 
 
 
 &#8722; the physical separation of departments to insulate them from each other;
 &#8722; an educational programme, normally recurring, to emphasise the importance of not improperly or inadvertently divulging confidential information;
 &#8722; strict and carefully defined procedures for dealing with situations where it is thought the wall should be crossed, and the maintaining of proper records where this occurs;
 &#8722; monitoring by compliance officers of the effectiveness of the Chinese wall;
 &#8722; disciplinary sanctions where there has been a breach of the wall.

448 Nevertheless, as I have said above at [310], [318] [319], in Bolkiah , Lord Millett referred to Chinese walls as a technique for managing conflicts of interest and he described the types of organisational structures that would ordinarily be effective.

449 Mr Monaci's statement of evidence set out in great detail the measures which Citigroup has in place. These appear to me to comply with the requirements stated by the UK Law Commission and adopted by Lord Millett in Bolkiah . I will not repeat the evidence but the paragraph numbers of Mr Monaci's statement which describe the arrangements are as follows: 
 
 
 &#8722; physical separation by departments, [85] [94];
 &#8722; educational programmes, [95] [106], especially [103] and [105];
 &#8722; procedures for dealing with crossing the wall, [109] [116];
 &#8722; monitoring by compliance officers, [117] [123] and [131] [144];
 &#8722; disciplinary sanctions, [100].

450 Mr Monaci also referred in other parts of his statement to Citigroup's policies and procedures for the identification and management of conflicts of interest that arise in its business. He referred to some of the written policies which apply to Citigroup's Australian operations. They were set out at [147] of his statement.

451 Mr Monaci said at [149] that Citigroup's written policies are available to all employees and regular training is provided. He said at [150] that the written policies make clear that employees must be alert to the possibility of conflicts and "escalate any issues in relation to actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest."</text>

I also accept that the phrase is to be construed in light of the modern corporate practice of carrying on business as a corporate group.

433 But the difficulty which arises is, how can it be said that Virgin, as a 62.4% owned subsidiary of Patrick, carried on the business of that entity. ASIC submitted that to say so would be to find that Virgin, a listed company conducting the business of an airline, was carrying on the business of its major shareholder, Patrick, a listed company carrying on the business of a stevedore.

434 Subparagraph (c)(ii)(A) must be read with s 20 of the Corporations Act which provides as follows:
 "A reference in this Act to a person carrying on a business, or a business of a particular kind, is a reference to the person carrying on a business, or a business of that kind, whether alone or together with any other person or persons."

438 I have therefore come to the view that, applying the approach to construction stated in Project Blue Sky , Virgin can be said to have been carrying on the business of Patrick, notwithstanding that it was not carrying on the whole of that business. I reject ASIC's submission that the "business" that Patrick had in relation to Virgin is properly characterised as "the business of owning 62.4% of Virgin Blue".

439 It also follows from this that Virgin shares are not "other financial products" and therefore that the advice did not fall within Reg 7.1.29(3)(c)(iii) of the Corporations Regulations .

440 On this finding, the exemption contained in Reg 7.1.29(3)(c) would have been engaged so that Citigroup would not have been providing financial services to Toll for the purpose of s 912A(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act .</text>

<tocase>R v Firns [2001] NSWCCA 191 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 548</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCCA/2001/191.html</AustLII>
<text>546 The question of whether a matter is "readily observable" is one of fact. Observability does not depend on proof that persons actually perceived the information; the test is objective and hypothetical: see R v Firns [2001] NSWCCA 191 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 548 at [88] per Mason P.

547 Where the information is a "matter of supposition", the question of whether it is generally available depends on whether the supposition is capable of being made or drawn by other investors based on readily observable matter or information that has been made known in the manner stated in s 1042C(1)(b)(i) of the Corporations Act : see s 1042C(1)(c).

548 ASIC called Mr Sisson to give expert evidence. However, his first report dated 31 October 2006 did not deal with the question of whether the "information" relied on by ASIC was generally available. Mr Sisson did address the question briefly in a later report dated 16 March 2007, in reply to the evidence of Citigroup's expert, Mr Richard Mews.

551 However, in my view, the test applied by Mr Sisson as to whether the information was generally available was not in accordance with that which has been recognised by the authorities. There are two reasons for this. First, the test of whether material is readily observable is not whether the particular matter was widely observed but whether it could have been: see R v Firns at [88], [91] per Mason P; see also Hannes v DPP at [626] per Barr and Hall JJ.

552 The second reason is that s 1042C(1)(c) of the Corporations Act does not appear to involve a consideration of whether the market has had a reasonable time to absorb the information: see the analysis of the extrinsic material in [55] [56] of the judgment of Mason P in R v Firns . His Honour was of the view that Parliament's intention was not to "penalise individual initiative and diligence."

553 Thus, it seems to me that Mr Sisson's evidence on this question must be rejected. The effect of what he did was to ask whether it was generally available by considering the question of whether it was generally known.

554 Nevertheless, it does not follow that I must find that the information was generally available. Citigroup submitted that I should make this finding upon the basis of the evidence of its expert, Mr Mews. But I am not satisfied that Mr Mews' evidence establishes the proposition for which Citigroup contends.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCCA/2000/503.html</AustLII>
<text>503 It seems to me that the case must fail unless I find that Mr Manchee made the supposition in precisely those terms. This is because the authorities establish the central importance of the identified information to the statutory scheme: see R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503 ; (2000) 158 FLR 359 at [26] [27] per Spigelman CJ. Reference has also been made to the level of precision required in formulating the charge: see Hannes v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373 ; 60 ACSR 1 at [377] , [415] per Barr and Hall JJ.

558 The position seems to me to be analogous to that which was referred to by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes at [254] [257]. Here the supposition that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the Patrick takeover was one essential part of the "information" on which the claim was based. As Spigelman CJ said at [257], if it was generally available, one would expect to find it in the contemporaneous reports. Yet no such evidence was available, even in the form of speculation or rumour.

559 Mr Mews and Mr Sisson agreed that when one is considering whether information in the form of a deduction is generally available, the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle is apt. But as Mr Sisson said, if all pieces other than those from a small area are removed, as Mr Mews appears to have done, it is relatively easy to fit the remaining pieces together to reach the desired conclusion.

560 Counsel for Citigroup pointed to the evidence of Mr Harvey to support a finding that the information was generally available. Mr Harvey was called by ASIC to give evidence on its behalf.</text>

<text>492 In Re HIH Insurance Limited (in prov liq) ; ASIC v Adler [2002] NSWSC 171 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 72 per Santow J, a question arose as to whether Mr Adler, who was a director of the parent company but not of the subsidiary, was an "officer" of the subsidiary company. Santow J held that he was an officer of the subsidiary under subparagraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of the definition.

493 The reason Santow J found that Mr Adler was an officer was that as a director of the holding company and a member of its investment committee, he participated in decision making as to how the funds of the HIH group were invested. His Honour said it was for this reason that Mr Adler was a person whose decisions clearly affected the whole or a substantial part of the business of the subsidiary as well as someone with the capacity to affect significantly the subsidiary's financial standing: see at [73] [75].</text>

<tocase>Ryan v Triguboff [1976] 1 NSWLR 588</tocase>
<text>528 In Ryan v Triguboff [1976] 1 NSWLR 588, Lee J dealt with the question of whether a deduction formed by the defendant could constitute "specific information" within s 75A of the Securities Industry Act. His Honour held at 597 that the deduction could not constitute "specific information" within the section because that expression required information that was capable of being pointed to and identified, and that it "must be capable of being expressed unequivocally".

529 The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1991 (Cth) amended the earlier provisions regulating insider trading which were contained in the Corporations Act 1989 , Corporations Law and Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 . The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act formed part of the arrangements for a national scheme for corporate regulation which came into operation on 1 January 1991.

530 The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act reformed the regulation of insider trading in light of the recommendations of the Report of the House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled "Fair Shares for All Insider Trading in Australia", (AGPS, 1989).

533 Thus, it can be seen that the purpose of the extended definition was to make it plain that the term was not to be confined to "specific information" consisting of an existing fact that was capable of being expressed unequivocally, as stated by Lee J in Ryan v Triguboff.</text>

But it is otherwise where the parties acknowledge that they are not in a fiduciary relationship.

<text>324 It is difficult to see that the words of the mandate letter have anything other than their plain meaning. Citigroup was retained solely as an adviser to Toll, as an independent contractor and not as a fiduciary. The engagement of Citigroup as an "independent contractor and not in any other capacity" suggested that the parties had in mind the distinction between independent contractors and employees or agents; see for example Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Limited [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ. Thus, these words also point against the assumption of any fiduciary capacity.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/52.html</AustLII>
<text>281 The effect of the Australian and English authorities referred to above is that where a fiduciary relationship is said to be founded upon a contract, the ordinary rules of construction of contracts apply. Thus, whether a party is subject to fiduciary obligations, and the scope of any fiduciary duties, is to be determined by construing the contract as a whole in the light of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction: see Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited v Coopers Brewery Limited [2006] FCAFC 144 ; (2006) 156 FCR 1 at [46] per Weinberg J. The same approach applies to exclusion clauses: see Darlington Futures Limited v Delco Australia Pty Limited [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Andar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [122] per Callinan J.</text>

<tocase>United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/49.html</AustLII>
<text>24 ASIC also points to events pre-dating the execution of the mandate letter as part of its case. However, a difficulty arises because of its disavowal of any fiduciary relationship pre-dating the actual execution of the mandate letter: cf United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 11-12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.

25 A central part of ASIC's case is that Citigroup was required, as a financial services licensee, to have in place adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest: see s 912A(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act . According to ASIC, conducting proprietary trading without having obtained Toll's informed consent to the proprietary trading, amounts to a breach of this subsection.

26 ASIC does not concede that, as a matter of statutory construction, s 912A(1)(aa) applies only where a licensee and its client are in a fiduciary relationship. However, Mr Walker SC, for ASIC, did concede that for the purposes of the present case, ASIC's contention that Citigroup contravened s 912A(1)(aa) depends upon the success of ASIC's submission that the parties were in a fiduciary relationship.

27 Even if Citigroup did owe fiduciary duties to Toll, the question of whether s 912A(1)(aa) was engaged depends upon a number of questions of statutory construction. The principal questions are whether Citigroup was providing "financial services" within the meaning of s 766A(1) and "financial product advice' within the meaning of s 766B(1) of the Corporations Act , as well as whether any such services were exempt services within Reg 7.1.29(3) of the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth).

28 ASIC seeks to argue the conflicts claim on three further bases. These are, first, a contravention of s 1041H of the Corporations Act , second, breach of s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) and third, breach of s 12CA of the ASIC Act . However, each of them depends upon acceptance of ASIC's contention that Citigroup owed fiduciary duties to Toll.

287 The subject matter over which any fiduciary obligations will extend must be determined by the character of the venture or undertaking: see Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited [1929] HCA 24 ; (1929) 42 CLR 384 at 408 per Dixon J; United Dominions v Brian at 13 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ; News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ. This is to be ascertained from the terms of the agreement and the course of dealing between the parties: see News Limited at 539 per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; Australian Breeders Co-operative Society Limited v Jones (1997) 150 ALR 488 at 514 per Wilcox and Lindgren JJ; Beach Petroleum NL v Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 1 at [194] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller JA and Stein JA.

299 This principle applies whether or not the costs agreement is made before the solicitor is instructed: see Symonds v Raphael [1998] FamCA 165 ; (1998) 148 FLR 171 at 186-187 per Baker and Burton JJ; see also McNamara at [38] per Doyle CJ. The reason given in those authorities for the proposition that the solicitor must make full disclosure even before the contract of retainer is that the fiduciary relationship may arise before the solicitor is actually retained: see United Dominions v Brian at 11-12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.

305 This points to a limitation of the principle to those who fall within an established category of fiduciary relationship or, at very least, to those who carry fiduciary obligations before the execution of the contract, as in United Dominions v Brian.

306 The second reason why the principle is not applicable in the present proceedings is that ASIC's case was that the fiduciary relationship between Citigroup and Toll arose from the mandate letter. ASIC specifically eschewed any suggestion that the fiduciary relationship arose prior to the execution of the mandate letter on 8 August 2005.

307 It follows that there is no place in these proceedings for the application of the principle that a person who is already subject to fiduciary obligations must obtain the client's fully informed consent to the exclusion or modification of those obligations.</text>

See also Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited [1994] UKHL 5 ; [1995] 2 AC 145 at 206 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.

295 In order to be exonerated, a fiduciary must give full and frank disclosure of all material facts: see Kuys at 1227 per Lord Wilberforce. Consent need not be given expressly; it may be implied in all the circumstances: see Woolworths v Kelly at 212 per Samuels JA, at 234 per Mahoney JA; see also Our Lady's Mount Pty Limited (as trustee) v Magnificat Meal Movement International Inc (1999) 33 ACSR 163 at [128] per Muir J.

323 In Chan v Zacharia , Deane J said in plain terms at 196 that the parties to a partnership agreement could provide "that any fiduciary relationship between the partners was excluded." The observations of Mahoney JA in Woolworths v Kelly at [225] were to the same effect. His Honour said that fiduciary duties could be "varied or released" by contract. Also, in News Limited , a Full Court of this Court (Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ) said at 539 that whether there are any fiduciary obligations at all may depend on the terms of the contract.</text>
