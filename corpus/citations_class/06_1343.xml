<text>Of the offences charged the most serious are those relating to the baby walkers. The two charges are linked. The prosecutor's investigation of the conduct of the defendant in marketing the baby walkers was commenced following a complaint from a member of the public who had purchased a walker from the defendant through the internet. The prosecutor then arranged for similar walkers to be purchased from the defendant and caused them to be subjected to analysis. As already noted, this analysis revealed that the walkers did not comply with standards prescribed pursuant to s 65C of the Act . Proceeding VID 385 of 2006 relates to the 'controlled' supply of the walkers to an officer employed by the prosecutor. Proceeding VID 388 of 2006 relates to the supply of the walker to the member of the public who complained to the prosecutor. Any supply of the walkers would constitute a breach of s 75AZS(1) of the Act . Forty seven such sales were admitted. Charges have only been laid in respect to the sales to the prosecutor and the complainant. Of the two sales the one to the complainant is the one in respect of which the defendant bears the greater degree of culpability. It was to be used by her daughter and would have been had the complainant not been alert to the deficiencies in the product and the absence of labelling. The walkers purchased by the investigator were not destined for use by any child. In considering the quantum of the penalties for these two offices (and, indeed, all the penalties to be imposed) I am required also to give effect to the totality principle in order to avoid a crushing aggregate penalty and to ensure, so far as is possible, that the aggregate penalty reflects the totality of the criminality involved: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1750 at [141] [143]. Having regard to all the circumstances I consider that the appropriate penalty in proceeding VID 388 should be $450,000 and in proceeding VID 385, $50,000.

The offence relating to the statement that the cots complied with Australian standards when they did not is also serious. No fewer than 15 departures from the prescribed standard were identified. I consider that a penalty of $350,000 is warranted in proceeding VID 386.

The final offence concerned the notice which advised customers that refunds were not available for products sold by defendant during a stock clearance. In my view an appropriate penalty in proceeding VID 387 is $10,000. 


 I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.

<text>A consideration, which is not specifically referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act but which has assumed considerable importance in the case law which has developed in relation to Part V of the Act , has been general deterrence. The absence of specific reference to general deterrence has not been interpreted as meaning that it is not a relevant consideration. The contrary is true: R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 at 430. In many cases decided under the Act , this Court has placed considerable emphasis on general deterrence as being an important factor to be brought to account where penalties or sentences are imposed for contraventions of Part V. This approach finds support in the expressed object of the Act 'to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection' (see s 2) and the significant monetary penalties, provided for in the Act , for contravention of consumer protection provisions such as those presently under consideration. It has become accepted that the imposition of substantial penalties for breaches of provisions which are designed to protect consumers, will serve to alert members of the business community to the provisions of the Act and the serious consequences which may flow from their contravention: see eg Pugh v Clark Rubber Limited (1993) ATPR 41-258 at 41, 473; Miller v Cunningham's Warehouse Sales Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41-321 at 42, 269; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1175 at [24] . This principle has been applied even where defendant companies have gone into liquidation and there is no realistic prospect of a substantial monetary penalty ever being paid: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Vales Wine Company Pty Ltd (1976) ATPR 41-528 at 42, 776; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 376 at [23] - [25] .</text>

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1175 at [10] - [12] Weinberg J noted certain observations of French J in Gardam v Splendid Enterprises Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-779 at 48, 502 to 48, 503 which he found to be a helpful statement of the principles which governed the determination of penalties to be fixed for breaches of the consumer protection provisions of the Act . His Honour held that these principles remained relevant notwithstanding the introduction of s 16A of the Crimes Act . The relevant observations of French J in Gardam are: 
 
 'The appropriate level of penalty to be fixed will vary according to the circumstances of each case and the class of relevant considerations is not closed. 
 
 Nevertheless it appears to be well established that the following matters are relevant to the punishment to be imposed. 
 
 
 
 
 1 The objectives of the Act . 
 2 The importance of any untrue statements made. 
 3 The degree of wilfulness or carelessness involved in making such a statement. 
 4 The extent to which the statements in question depart from the truth. 
 5 The degree of their dissemination. 
 6 The result in prejudice to consumers. 
 7 Whether any and if so what efforts have been made to correct the statements. 
 8 The need to impose deterrent penalties. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The sections of the Act which provide for the declaration of consumer product safety standards and their enforcement are plainly of the highest importance. 
 ... 
 
 In the present case the offences were not committed wilfully or with any intention to deceive. Their commission was the product of carelessness and lacks management. 
 
 As Smithers J said in Geoffrey John Eva v Mazda Motors (Sales) Pty Ltd .... 
 
 "....contraventions due to carelessness are not permissible and must be punished. Of course such contraventions are not in the same order as culpability as those involving an intention to deceive."'</text>
