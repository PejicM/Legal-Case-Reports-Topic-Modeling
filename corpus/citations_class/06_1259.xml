<tocase>The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd (2003) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 90-117</tocase>
<text>The principles to be applied in applications for dispensation such as this one have been referred to in a number of cases. Those cases have recognised that the policy underlying s 191(2)(c) is to give every affected policy holder a summary of the scheme and an opportunity, if he or she so desires, to make submissions to the Court in respect of any application for confirmation of the scheme ( The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd (2003) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 90-117 per Sackville J at [8]). A right to be heard in relation to a proposed scheme is of little value if a person is unaware of the proposal ( Commonwealth Life Limited at [8]). For these reasons, it was emphasised by Gyles J in Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618 that it would be unfortunate if a notion gained currency that s 191(2)(c) of the Act is a formality to be dispensed with as a matter of course (at [3]).</text>

<tocase>Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/524.html</AustLII>
<text>While the question is not free from authority to the contrary (see Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 at [19] ), it is assumed for the purposes of the applications that ' affected policy owner ' as defined by the Act includes policy holders of both the transferring (Lifetime and National) and receiving (MLC) funds.

The applicants seek a dispensation of their obligation to give summaries of the schemes to: &#8226; MLC policy holders who are affected by the Lifetime Scheme or the National Scheme; and &#8226; Lifetime and National policy holders for whom the applicants have no record of a current mailing address.</text>
