<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/18.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The first respondent further submitted that the Federal Magistrate was entitled to rely upon the decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 for the proposition that the Tribunal is not required to examine evidence about international standards of State protection.

26 The first respondent submitted that, in any event, it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the issue of State protection at all, because the Tribunal had already found that there was no real chance of the appellant being harmed in the future. In those circumstances, the issue of State protection did not arise: Respondents S152/2003 222 CLR 1 per McHugh J at [84]-[88]; SVTB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 104 at [22] - [23] .</text>

<tocase>SZEOP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 807</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/807.html</AustLII>
<text>27 The first respondent submitted that the assertion raised by the appellant in the third ground of appeal that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by stating that the appellant had "fabricated aspects of his claim to enhance his application" was raised for the first time on the appeal. Nevertheless, the first respondent submitted that the authorities mentioned in the particulars by the appellant (being Rares J's decisions of SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [60] - [64] and SZEOP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 807 at [24] ) were irrelevant to this case. The first respondent further submitted that it was open to the Tribunal, for the reasons it gave, to find that the applicant had fabricated aspects of his claim to enhance his application for a protection visa.

34 It is not claimed in this ground of appeal that the Tribunal was under an obligation to give notice of any matter pursuant to s 424A of the Act. Rares J's decisions in SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 and SZEOP [2007] FCA 807 were concerned with the question of notice under s 424A. The third ground of appeal is not made out.</text>
