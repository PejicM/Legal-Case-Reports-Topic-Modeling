<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1</tocase>

<text>17 In order to establish practical unfairness, it must be shown that a person has been given an expectation by the Minister "as to a procedural step to be taken", which was not taken so that it may be said that a legitimate expectation held was disappointed (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [36] per Gleeson CJ).

18 Neither IFT or any of its members or, indeed, The Wilderness Society Inc., can show it or they were misled by the Minister. The subjective expectation held by opponents of the proposed action was generated by the RPDC process. While the Minister's predecessor agreed on assessment through the RPDC jointly with Tasmania, nothing the Minister did contributed to the demise of the RPDC. Further, the number and nature of the environmental matters relevant to the Minister's decision on approval are narrower than those dealt with by the RPDC. Even in that respect, the evidence of IFT is very general. There is no evidence of what precise material would have been put to the Minister had he decided on a longer period for "comment" than 20 business days. For example, Ms Christina Holmdahl referred to "detailed expert reports" on "flora and fauna and social and economic issues including but not only the impact on tourism".

19 The kind of material which IFT wished to put to the Minister, if there was more time, largely relates to matters which are relevant to Tasmania's assessment process, rather than the Minister's. The same can be said of the matters identified by Mr Paul Oosting at [59] of his affidavit dated 16 May 2007 in the TWS proceeding, with the exception of "marine impacts (including environmental impacts and particular species impacts)", "threatened species, as it relates to the site of the pulp mill", "social impacts" and "economic impacts". The limited nature of the matters which could be addressed with respect to the controlling provisions, combined with the limited nature of the evidence that could be put forward in respect of them, does not make it clear that the 20 business day time limit for comment amounts to a denial of procedural fairness in the circumstances.

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>9 In the TWS proceeding, I held that s 131AA(7) of the EPBC Act is a complete statement of the Minister's obligation to provide procedural fairness in relation to his decision to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of an action and any conditions attaching to approval. If that is not correct and the obligation is wider, it is one that must be considered in the context of the EPBC Act and in the context of the facts and circumstances before the Minister (see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at [26] ).

10 That the EPBC Act has provisions dealing with steps to be taken before a decision on approval is made suggests that the EPBC Act makes careful provision for when, and to what extent, comment from interested persons and/or the public is required.

11 Under s 74(3) of the EPBC Act, as soon as practicable after receiving a referral of a proposal to take an action, the Minister must cause to be published on the internet the referral and "an invitation for anyone to give the Minister comments within 10 business days" on whether the action is a controlled action. In making a controlled action decision under s 75, the Minister is required by s 75(1A) to consider the comments received in response to such an invitation, as long as they are received within the time specified. Under s 75(5), the Minister is obliged to make the controlled action decision within 20 business days after receiving the referral.</text>

<tocase>The Wilderness Society Inc. v The Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1178.html</AustLII>
<text>1 This proceeding was heard at the same time as The Wilderness Society Inc. v The Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1178 (TWS proceeding). These reasons for judgment are to be read together with the reasons for judgment published in the TWS proceeding. Terms defined in the reasons for judgment in the TWS proceeding have the same meaning in these reasons for judgment.

2 The grounds of review relied on in this proceeding overlap substantially with the grounds relied on in the TWS proceeding. There is a difference between the grounds in the applications dealing with the allegation that the Minister took into account Gunns' commercial imperatives in making the 2007 assessment approach decision.

3 Ground nine of the grounds of review in this proceeding states that the 2007 assessment approach decision is invalid or is not authorised by the EPBC Act because the Minister took into account an irrelevant consideration. Ground 10 in the TWS proceeding alleges that the 2007 assessment approach decision involved an improper exercise of power in that it was made for a purpose, or included a purpose, other than that for which the power was conferred. I rejected that submission in the TWS proceeding.</text>
