<text>17 The principles which apply in this situation are not in doubt. In Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323 (" Kovalev ") at 326-328, French J explained the relevant principles:
 
 "In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power. This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties. Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities. 
 
 An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be self-explanatory as must any order. It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record. 
 
 There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decision-maker or tribunal to be decided 'according to law' and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded. The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation. To do so in my opinion is a purported, but not an actual exercise of judicial power. Moreover, in a practical sense the decision-maker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decision-maker or tribunal is required to do. In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant. The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify. And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content. In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside, the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law. A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate. 
 
 ... 
 
 ... It is well-established that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power. The parties cannot, by consent, confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission ( 1981 ) [1981] HCA 48 ; 148 CLR 150 at 163. The question whether a consent order is to be made, is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court. In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute (WA) Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there. It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decision-maker or a tribunal. 
 
 ... 
 
 ... In the case of error of law attributed to a decision-maker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Court's specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred. 
 
 It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decision-maker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decision-maker or tribunal. If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural, there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases. To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decision-maker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties." 


As French J noted, Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265. Subsequently, Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J. Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for the making of the order can appear in the Court's reasons for judgment, rather than in the order itself. Similar views were expressed by RD Nicholson J in Xiao v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 459 ; (2001) 109 FCR 129. The principles explained by French J in Kovalev have been approved numerous times: see Re Allan and Repatriation Commission (2003) 77 ALD 140 at 144-145 [12]-[14]; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 110 [55] - [56] ; and WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730 at [5] .</text>

The principles explained by French J in Kovalev have been approved numerous times: see Re Allan and Repatriation Commission (2003) 77 ALD 140 at 144-145 [12]-[14]; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 110 [55] - [56] ; and WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730 at [5] .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/730.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The principles which apply in this situation are not in doubt. In Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323 (" Kovalev ") at 326-328, French J explained the relevant principles:
 
 "In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power. This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties. Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities. 
 
 An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be self-explanatory as must any order. It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record. 
 
 There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decision-maker or tribunal to be decided 'according to law' and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded. The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation. To do so in my opinion is a purported, but not an actual exercise of judicial power. Moreover, in a practical sense the decision-maker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decision-maker or tribunal is required to do. In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant. The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify. And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content. In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside, the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law. A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate. 
 
 ... 
 
 ... It is well-established that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power. The parties cannot, by consent, confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission ( 1981 ) [1981] HCA 48 ; 148 CLR 150 at 163. The question whether a consent order is to be made, is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court. In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute (WA) Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there. It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decision-maker or a tribunal. 
 
 ... 
 
 ... In the case of error of law attributed to a decision-maker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Court's specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred. 
 
 It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decision-maker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decision-maker or tribunal. If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural, there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases. To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decision-maker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties." 


As French J noted, Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265. Subsequently, Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J. Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for the making of the order can appear in the Court's reasons for judgment, rather than in the order itself. Similar views were expressed by RD Nicholson J in Xiao v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 459 ; (2001) 109 FCR 129.

<tocase>Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 CLR 549</tocase>
<text>25 I am also satisfied that the erroneous classification of the products amounts to an error of law. There has been some debate about whether a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of a word used in a statutory provision can of itself amount to an error of law. In Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549 at 564-565, Lockhart J said:
 
 "I now turn to a submission made on behalf of the appellants that the question which was before the Customs for determination in this case was one of fact and that the primary judge erred in treating it as a question of law. Reliance was placed upon the principle that, where a word is an ordinary English word, its meaning is not a question of law and, accordingly, whether the facts of a given case fall within that meaning is a question of fact. Reference was made to Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 29 ALR 577 at 580-2; [1980] HCA 16 ; 144 CLR 1 at 6-8 (per Mason J); Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (No 2) (1980) 3 ALD 38 at 49-51 (per Fisher J) and at 55-6 (per Sheppard J); and Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854, esp at 861 (per Lord Reid) where his Lordship said: 'The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law. The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is. ... It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider, not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved. If it is alleged that the tribunal has reached a wrong decision then there can be a question of law, but only of a limited character. The question would normally be whether their decision was unreasonable in the sense that no tribunal acquainted with the ordinary use of language could reasonably reach that decision.' 
 
 In my opinion this principle has no application in this case. If taken to its logical conclusion the appellants' argument really asserts that it is for the Customs to say in each case whether any, and if so which, provision of the Tariff applies to particular goods. But it is not a question of the Customs simply determining whether particular goods fall within the meaning of ordinary English words. What the Customs would be deciding, if the appellants are correct, is whether the description of particular goods falls within particular chapters, items, sub-items, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs of the Tariff. It must be a question of law whether a given description of goods falls within a particular part of the Tariff. Here the question is what particular part of the relevant Schedule, if any, applies. This necessarily involves a question of construction of the Tariff and is a question of law: see Whitton v Falkiner [1915] HCA 38 ; (1915) 20 CLR 118, per Isaacs J (at 127)."

27 Subsequently, the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 (" Baxter Healthcare ") in a most helpful judgment. His Honour said at 471-472:
 
 "A preliminary point should be mentioned, since it is important, although little attention was paid to it in argument. Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute (as in a case raising the application of a tariff item), the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself. With regard to the words, '[t]he question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in [a] Statute is one of fact not of law': Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ. Nevertheless, once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact, whether it falls within the verbal description will, in many cases, be a question of law. For, in the first place, it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases, but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction, which is a process of law: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 10 per Mason J, with whose reasons Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ stated their agreement. The principle that construction is a process of law has never been doubted, although the completeness of the proposition derived from it that '[t]he effect or construction of a term once its meaning or interpretation is established is a matter of law': Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs (1994) 124 ALR 645 at 648 per Gummow J; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (at 287), and the relationship between that proposition and the proposition that the meaning of an ordinary word or phrase is a matter of fact, were left in some doubt when Agfa-Gevaert v Collector of Customs was reversed on appeal by the High Court: see Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 395-397. 
 
 Gummow J, in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs , also held (ibid) that it is a question of law 'whether the facts as found fall within the terms of the law as properly construed; to this there is the qualification that, where the statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts as found fall within those words, the decision as to whether they do so fall generally is a matter of fact'. His Honour added that the limitation 'generally' was required, even in this last case, 'because the law may use a word in an ordinary sense, but there may be a number of ordinary senses and it then is necessary to select that which is appropriate, and because whilst the word may have but one ordinary meaning that is imprecise, the word will take its colour from the context and that will require construction of the law, a lawyer's task. The result in such cases will be more than the matching of a set of facts with plain words'. The proposition that 'whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law' was stated to be sustained by '[m]any authorities' in the judgment of Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council (at 7). The same proposition was subsequently applied by Full Courts of this Court to cases where what was in issue was whether facts as found fell within the provision of a tariff item: Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549; Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285 at 293, 306."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/36.html</AustLII>
<text>26 In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 396-397, the High Court expressed reservations about the supposed distinction between the ordinary meaning of words, which is said to raise a question of fact, and the construction and effect of a term or provision which is said to raise a question of law. The Court said:
 
 "With respect this distinction seems artificial, if not illusory. The meaning attributed to individual words in a phrase ultimately dictates the effect or construction that one gives to the phrase when taken as a whole and the approach that one adopts in determining the meaning of the individual words of that phrase is bound up in the syntactical construction of the phrase in question. In R v Brown, a recent House of Lords decision, Lord Hoffmann said: 
 
 
 'The fallacy in the Crown's argument is, I think, one common among lawyers, namely to treat the words of an English sentence as building blocks whose meaning cannot be affected by the rest of the sentence ... This is not the way language works. The unit of communication by means of language is the sentence and not the parts of which it is composed. The significance of individual words is affected by other words and the syntax of the whole.' 
 
 
 If the notions of meaning and construction are interdependent, as we think they are, then it is difficult to see how meaning is a question of fact while construction is a question of law without insisting on some qualification concerning construction that is currently absent from the law." 
 

However, the Court did not find it necessary to resolve this issue.

27 Subsequently, the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 (" Baxter Healthcare ") in a most helpful judgment. His Honour said at 471-472:
 
 "A preliminary point should be mentioned, since it is important, although little attention was paid to it in argument.

 Gummow J, in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs , also held (ibid) that it is a question of law 'whether the facts as found fall within the terms of the law as properly construed; to this there is the qualification that, where the statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts as found fall within those words, the decision as to whether they do so fall generally is a matter of fact'.

30 The second qualification arises where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of a statutory word or expression, and that uncertainty can be resolved by construing the word according to its context. That process raises a question of law. Burchett J explained why this is so in the following passage at 473-474: 
 
 "In such a case, a court or tribunal does not choose between different possible applications of the one equivocal or inexact statutory concept (for example, 'insulting') to an evaluation or an appreciation (in the French sense see 69 ALJ 984) of the facts, but chooses upon the principles of construction between possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression. Of course, it is conceivable that a particular provision in an enactment will raise both kinds of problem. But Gummow J's remarks in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs seem to me to involve that, where the susceptibility of words and expressions to different meanings or shades of meaning is to be resolved by a process of construction of the statutory language in order to determine whether it embraces the facts found, the ultimate question is one of law. This accords with the view of Fullagar J in Hayes v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) , with Hope at 10, and with the joint judgment of Sheppard and Burchett JJ in Australian National Railways Commission v Collector of Customs (SA) (1985) 8 FCR 264 at 277. In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd at 397, the joint judgment of the High Court refers to the principle 'that the determination of whether an "Act uses [an] expression ... in any other sense than that which they have [scilicet, it has] in ordinary speech" is always a question of law'. On that basis, logically it must also be a question of law, in a case where a statutory expression has several ordinary senses, whether it is used in a particular one of them. And as the joint judgment of Neaves, French and Cooper JJ in Pozzolanic Enterprises points out (at 288-289), uncertainties may require to be resolved by reference to a value judgment about the range of the Act, rather than a matching of the facts to the, or an, ordinary meaning of the words. Their Honours said: 
 
 'Although the words of the statute are construed according to their ordinary English meaning, that does not mean that their application to a set of facts is simply described as the matching of that set of facts with a factual description. There is necessarily a selection process involved. The range of relationships to which the words apply for the purpose of the Act depends upon a judgment about that purpose. The selection process involved is analogous to that used in determining what causal relationships between conduct and loss attract liability for the purpose of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act (1974) (Cth): see Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418-419; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 58 FCR 274 at 286-288; 84 ALR 700 at 712-713. In the end this is not a process of fact finding. The facts are found. What is left is a value judgment about the range of the Act and that is a question of law.'

28 Burchett J recognised that complexities can arise in the application of these principles, and for that reason he said that at least two qualifications should be added.

30 The second qualification arises where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of a statutory word or expression, and that uncertainty can be resolved by construing the word according to its context. That process raises a question of law. Burchett J explained why this is so in the following passage at 473-474: 
 
 "In such a case, a court or tribunal does not choose between different possible applications of the one equivocal or inexact statutory concept (for example, 'insulting') to an evaluation or an appreciation (in the French sense see 69 ALJ 984) of the facts, but chooses upon the principles of construction between possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression.

39 At the very least, the examples in heading 3808 and the references to camphor and mosquito spirals and coils in sub-heading 3808.10.10 suggest that there is some ambiguity about the way in which the term insecticide is used in the heading. To adapt the language used by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare , a legal choice must be made about possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression, and in making that choice it is appropriate to take account of the intent and purpose of the Customs Tariff Act . In my opinion, it would have been permissible for the Tribunal to have regard to the Harmonised System Notes as an extrinsic aid to the interpretation of heading 3808. Where the language of a heading is ambiguous or susceptible to different interpretations, the Harmonised System Notes are an appropriate extrinsic aid to interpretation: Gardner Smith v Collector of Customs Victoria (1986) 66 ALR 377 at 383-384; Barry R Liggins Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1991) 103 ALR 565 at 571-573; and Toyota Tsusho Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1992] FCA 282 at [22] - [30] .</text>

<text>25 I am also satisfied that the erroneous classification of the products amounts to an error of law. There has been some debate about whether a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of a word used in a statutory provision can of itself amount to an error of law. In Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549 at 564-565, Lockhart J said:
 
 "I now turn to a submission made on behalf of the appellants that the question which was before the Customs for determination in this case was one of fact and that the primary judge erred in treating it as a question of law. Reliance was placed upon the principle that, where a word is an ordinary English word, its meaning is not a question of law and, accordingly, whether the facts of a given case fall within that meaning is a question of fact.

The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is. ... It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider, not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved. If it is alleged that the tribunal has reached a wrong decision then there can be a question of law, but only of a limited character. The question would normally be whether their decision was unreasonable in the sense that no tribunal acquainted with the ordinary use of language could reasonably reach that decision.' 
 
 In my opinion this principle has no application in this case. If taken to its logical conclusion the appellants' argument really asserts that it is for the Customs to say in each case whether any, and if so which, provision of the Tariff applies to particular goods. But it is not a question of the Customs simply determining whether particular goods fall within the meaning of ordinary English words. What the Customs would be deciding, if the appellants are correct, is whether the description of particular goods falls within particular chapters, items, sub-items, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs of the Tariff. It must be a question of law whether a given description of goods falls within a particular part of the Tariff. Here the question is what particular part of the relevant Schedule, if any, applies. This necessarily involves a question of construction of the Tariff and is a question of law: see Whitton v Falkiner [1915] HCA 38 ; (1915) 20 CLR 118, per Isaacs J (at 127)."

29 The first qualification arises where a statute uses a word whose meaning is clear but the word is inherently capable of more than one application or outcome in the circumstances of the case. In such a case, the question whether the statutory description is satisfied will often be simply a question of fact: see, for example, the discussion of Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854 by Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7-8; and see also Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1995) 59 FCR 6 at 14-15.</text>

<text>25 I am also satisfied that the erroneous classification of the products amounts to an error of law. There has been some debate about whether a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of a word used in a statutory provision can of itself amount to an error of law. In Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549 at 564-565, Lockhart J said:
 
 "I now turn to a submission made on behalf of the appellants that the question which was before the Customs for determination in this case was one of fact and that the primary judge erred in treating it as a question of law. Reliance was placed upon the principle that, where a word is an ordinary English word, its meaning is not a question of law and, accordingly, whether the facts of a given case fall within that meaning is a question of fact. Reference was made to Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 29 ALR 577 at 580-2; [1980] HCA 16 ; 144 CLR 1 at 6-8 (per Mason J); Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (No 2) (1980) 3 ALD 38 at 49-51 (per Fisher J) and at 55-6 (per Sheppard J); and Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854, esp at 861 (per Lord Reid) where his Lordship said: 'The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law. The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is. ... It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider, not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved.

27 Subsequently, the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 (" Baxter Healthcare ") in a most helpful judgment. His Honour said at 471-472:
 
 "A preliminary point should be mentioned, since it is important, although little attention was paid to it in argument. Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute (as in a case raising the application of a tariff item), the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself. With regard to the words, '[t]he question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in [a] Statute is one of fact not of law': Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ. Nevertheless, once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact, whether it falls within the verbal description will, in many cases, be a question of law. For, in the first place, it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases, but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction, which is a process of law: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 10 per Mason J, with whose reasons Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ stated their agreement. The principle that construction is a process of law has never been doubted, although the completeness of the proposition derived from it that '[t]he effect or construction of a term once its meaning or interpretation is established is a matter of law': Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs (1994) 124 ALR 645 at 648 per Gummow J; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (at 287), and the relationship between that proposition and the proposition that the meaning of an ordinary word or phrase is a matter of fact, were left in some doubt when Agfa-Gevaert v Collector of Customs was reversed on appeal by the High Court: see Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 395-397. 
 
 Gummow J, in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs , also held (ibid) that it is a question of law 'whether the facts as found fall within the terms of the law as properly construed; to this there is the qualification that, where the statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts as found fall within those words, the decision as to whether they do so fall generally is a matter of fact'. His Honour added that the limitation 'generally' was required, even in this last case, 'because the law may use a word in an ordinary sense, but there may be a number of ordinary senses and it then is necessary to select that which is appropriate, and because whilst the word may have but one ordinary meaning that is imprecise, the word will take its colour from the context and that will require construction of the law, a lawyer's task. The result in such cases will be more than the matching of a set of facts with plain words'. The proposition that 'whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law' was stated to be sustained by '[m]any authorities' in the judgment of Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council (at 7). The same proposition was subsequently applied by Full Courts of this Court to cases where what was in issue was whether facts as found fell within the provision of a tariff item: Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549; Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285 at 293, 306."

29 The first qualification arises where a statute uses a word whose meaning is clear but the word is inherently capable of more than one application or outcome in the circumstances of the case. In such a case, the question whether the statutory description is satisfied will often be simply a question of fact: see, for example, the discussion of Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854 by Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7-8; and see also Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1995) 59 FCR 6 at 14-15.</text>

<tocase>Markwell v Wollaston [1906] HCA 91 ; (1906) 4 CLR 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1906/91.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The Tribunal placed some reliance upon the following observations of Griffith CJ in Markwell v Wollaston [1906] HCA 91 ; (1906) 4 CLR 141 (" Markwell v Wollaston ") at 148:
 
 "In my opinion, the term insecticide, as commonly used in English, means, or at any rate includes, any preparation in the nature of a drug or chemical adapted solely or mainly to the destruction of insect life, and the effect of which is produced either by immediate contact with the insect or by some influence fatal to insect life inherent in or emanating from the preparation." 
 

It is noteworthy that Griffiths CJ did not confine the common meaning of insecticide to preparations aimed solely or mainly at the destruction of insect life. He expressly recognised that in common usage the term insecticide might be broader than the meaning he was concerned to address.

36 What is of much greater significance is that heading 3808 and its sub-headings contain other indications that the word 'insecticide' is used in a way that embraces products that are designed to exterminate, reduce, repel or control targeted insect populations. Sub-heading 3808.10, 'Insecticides', is elaborated by sub-headings 3808.10.10 and 3808.10.90. Sub-heading 3808.10.10 provides that certain types of insecticides, namely camphor, fly papers and mosquito spirals and coils, are to be free of duty, whereas other insecticides attract duty at the rate of 5 per cent. We know from Markwell v Wollaston that the mixture of oil and resin that is smeared on fly paper is a preparation that falls within the ordinary meaning of the term 'insecticide'. The terms 'camphor' and 'mosquito coils' are defined in the Macquarie Dictionary (3 rd Ed) as follows:
 
 "Camphor 1. a bicyclic, aliphatic, terpenoid ketone, C 10 H 16 O, obtained chiefly from the camphor laurel or by synthesis, and used in medicine, the manufacture of celluloid, etc. 2. any of various similar substances, for household use as an insect deterrent. 
 
 Mosquito coil a stiff coil of insect-repellent material, which, when set on a stand and ignited, burns slowly and releases insect-repellent smoke." 


By treating camphor and mosquito coils as insecticides, it is apparent that heading 3808 and its sub-headings use the term 'insecticide' so as to include chemicals or products which repel or deter insects. The term is not used in a way which is confined to chemicals which directly or indirectly kill or exterminate insects.

37 The examples given in parentheses in heading 3808, namely sulphur treated bands, wicks and candles and fly papers, provide another indicator that points in the same direction. The first two examples suggest that the word 'insecticides' in heading 3808 is intended to include products that repel insects or that in some way modify the behaviour or physiology of insects so as to render them less pestilent.

38 The Tribunal failed to take these contextual indications into account. Both sets of indications support a wider meaning of 'insecticide' than that adopted by the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Gardner Smith v Collector of Customs Victoria (1986) 66 ALR 377</tocase>
<text>39 At the very least, the examples in heading 3808 and the references to camphor and mosquito spirals and coils in sub-heading 3808.10.10 suggest that there is some ambiguity about the way in which the term insecticide is used in the heading. To adapt the language used by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare , a legal choice must be made about possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression, and in making that choice it is appropriate to take account of the intent and purpose of the Customs Tariff Act . In my opinion, it would have been permissible for the Tribunal to have regard to the Harmonised System Notes as an extrinsic aid to the interpretation of heading 3808. Where the language of a heading is ambiguous or susceptible to different interpretations, the Harmonised System Notes are an appropriate extrinsic aid to interpretation: Gardner Smith v Collector of Customs Victoria (1986) 66 ALR 377 at 383-384; Barry R Liggins Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1991) 103 ALR 565 at 571-573; and Toyota Tsusho Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1992] FCA 282 at [22] - [30] .</text>

<tocase>Mattinson v Multiplo Incubators Pty Ltd [1977] 1 NSWLR 368</tocase>
<text>46 The Tribunal held that it was necessary to find a class or genus of goods common to all of the particular descriptive words which proceed the phrase 'and similar products' in heading 3808. The appellant was critical of this approach, but there is nothing exceptional or unorthodox about it. Such approach is commonly referred to as an application of the ejusdem generis rule, but it overstates its proper function to call it a rule. It is no more than a guide to interpretation and must be used cautiously: see Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (5 th Ed) at [4.19]-[4.24]. The rule has been criticised by Mahoney JA in Mattinson v Multiplo Incubators Pty Ltd [1977] 1 NSWLR 368 at 373 and by Wells J in Brewarrana Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Highways (No 2) (1973) 6 SASR 541 at 587. There will be occasions when it is not appropriate to apply the rule having regard to the context and purpose of the particular statutory provision. There will also be occasions where the descriptive terms that precede the general words are so varied that it is futile to search for a single genus or class that can be of assistance in giving meaning to the general words. Conversely, there will be occasions where it is both sensible and appropriate to give meaning to the general words by identifying the class or genus that is indicated by the preceding particular words. All in all, the surest approach is to give meaning to general words which follow particular words in a statutory provision by determining the meaning of those words in their context and by reference to the purpose of the provision, in the same way as meaning is given to other words in a statute.</text>

<tocase>Acrow Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (1986) 12 FCR 129</tocase>
<text>48 The appellant argued that it is sufficient in law if the goods in question are similar to any of the goods previously described by name, citing Acrow Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (1986) 12 FCR 129 at 132. The appellant also submitted that if the Tribunal had asked itself the question whether the products in question were similar to insecticides, it would have been bound to answer the question affirmatively.

49 It is unnecessary for me to express any concluded view about this aspect of the appellant's argument. I have some reservations about it. It begs the question as to what standard of similarity is to be applied. Moreover, if the term insecticides were properly defined in its statutory context in the narrow way that the Tribunal determined, it would not necessarily follow that the products were similar to insecticides.

50 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal erred in law in classifying the products under sub-heading 2905.29.00 because Ch 29 only applies to chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. The products in question were not merely chemicals but rather devices for dispensing certain chemical agents.</text>

<tocase>Re Bayer v Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1985) 7 ALN 84</tocase>
<text>54 Paragraph 1(e) of the Note provides another indication that Ch 29 does not apply to dispensing devices. Its effect is that a chemical mixture will fall outside Ch 29 if the chemical compound in question is dissolved in a solvent for reasons other than safety or transport, or if the solvent renders the chemical particularly suitable for some specific commercial use rather than general use. An earlier version of the same provision was explained and applied in Re Bayer Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1985) 7 ALN 84. That case concerned a chemical known as flumethrin which was the active ingredient in a cattle tick insecticide. The flumethrin was imported in 200 litre drums as a 60 per cent premix concentrate dissolved in a solvent. The Tribunal held that the chemical mixture was taken outside Ch 29 by the relevant paragraph of Note 1. This was because the addition of the solvent so as to make a standardised 60 per cent solution was not a normal and necessary method adopted solely for reasons of safety or for the purpose of transporting the goods as required by the Note; it was also adopted for several other reasons including the production of a workable solution at the place where final mixing takes place.

55 In my opinion, these indications are confirmed by a reading of the whole of Ch 29.

56 The Tribunal did not examine Note 1 to Ch 29. Nor did it specifically consider the question whether Ch 29 was confined to chemicals, and was incapable of applying to dispensing devices which incorporated a chemical dosage. Rather, the Tribunal moved directly to r 3 of Sch 2.</text>
