<text>52 The refusal of an adjournment may amount to a denial of procedural fairness if it is likely to deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ ( Bhardwaj ); Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27] ). The procedure that will satisfy the demands of procedural fairness may differ in order "to meet the particular exigencies of the case" ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J). As I stated in Ali v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1415 ; (2005) 41 AAR 410 at [27] :
 Ultimately, each complaint of a failure to accord procedural fairness by reason of the refusal of an adjournment turns on its own facts. Whether an adjournment should be granted is a matter within the discretion of the trial Judge (or Tribunal), to be resolved according to the overall requirements of justice in the particular circumstances [citation omitted].</text>
