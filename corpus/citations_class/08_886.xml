<text>6 While it is clear that the applicant's first set of challenges to the initial decision of the tribunal was properly grounded, since he succeeded before Gyles J, the second challenges failed. The current challenge is a further attempt to attack the 2006 decision of the tribunal. For the reasons that I gave in SZGJY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 888 , it is clear that the tribunal had no jurisdiction on the second application for review filed at the end of last year: see also Minister for Immigration v Thiyagarajah [2000] HCA 9 ; (2000) 199 CLR 343 at 355-356 [30] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

<tocase>Zubair v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344</tocase>

<text>9 It is manifest that the tribunal never had any jurisdiction to decide a subsequent application to review the 2001 decision of a delegate once the 2006 decision of the tribunal had been given and not set aside in the courts. That decision replaced the delegate's decision and it was the only relevantly operative decision in law: Zubair v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344.

10 I am of opinion that the application should be dismissed.


 I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.
