<tocase>St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1337.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The learned Magistrate identified the appellant's principal contention on the review application as being that he was able to pay his debts as and when they became due, although his Honour recognised that solvency did not of itself entitle the appellant to have the petition dismissed: see St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337. On the issue of solvency, the evidence was then discussed in detail. His Honour was, ultimately, not satisfied that the appellant was able to pay his debts as and when they fell due. Included in the appellant's assets were 212 shares held in Manna Hill, which were found to be held on trust for the Moore Family Trust. It was accepted that the appellant was the trustee of the Moore Family Trust and a beneficiary, so that the shares in Manna Hill were treated as an asset of the appellant. However, his Honour was unable, on the evidence, to assign any value to that shareholding.

14 Nor was his Honour satisfied that other sufficient cause had been shown as to why the sequestration order should not be made. The two principal matters raised by the appellant as showing other sufficient cause for the petition being dismissed were his shareholding in Manna Hill, and the fact that the appellant (by his trustee) might not prosecute the appeal from the decision in the earlier proceedings. As to the latter point, his Honour proceeded on 'the basis that the appeal will ultimately be determined on its merits'.

15 Consequently, the review application was dismissed on 1 July 2005.

16 Those reasons for judgment also addressed the further evidence motion, dismissed on 17 June 2005. The learned Magistrate said that the appellant had been unable to identify any circumstances which had arisen since he reserved judgment on 13 May 2005 which warranted him being given leave to make further submissions (his Honour categorised the further evidence motion as one seeking to make further submissions rather than to adduce further evidence), and in particular submissions criticising the way the hearing of the review application had been conducted. Such criticisms, his Honour said, could be pursued upon any appeal. In reasons for decision given on 17 June 2005, the affidavit of the appellant in support of the further evidence motion was described as 'a reagitation of submissions' and suggestions of 'inadequacies relating to the conduct of the review application'. His Honour said then:
 
 '... there are no matters ... that relate to events that occurred since the reservation of my judgment which the justice of the case might require me to hear submissions about.'

17 On 1 July 2004, reasons were given for refusing the disqualification motion. The learned Magistrate pointed out that it was filed without a supporting affidavit. It was given a return date as the same date as the judgment on the review application, but called on only after that judgment. Hence, his Honour observed 'there would not appear to be any utility' in further hearing of that motion, and that any appeal from the decision on the review application would be the appropriate forum for agitating the appellant's concerns.

18 The appellant has been unrepresented at all times. His written documentation, whether in affidavit form or as submissions, and his oral submissions are argumentative, assertive, and often apparently repetitive. They are often extravagantly expressed, and he makes apparently unfounded but serious allegations.

19 The notice of appeal from the review application decision contains 29 grounds, but they are not clearly expressed and are repetitive. So far as I can determine, and omitting merely assertive claims (those where there is no particularity of the claim or of the error alleged such as unsupported claims of fraud or perversion of the course of justice), the notice of appeal claims that the learned Magistrate erred because:
 
 (1) there was no act of bankruptcy because the appellant was not served with the bankruptcy notice, because the bankruptcy notice was in a 'closed envelope'; (2) there was no service of the petition itself upon him, because the petition was also in a sealed envelope; (3) he found the appellant was not solvent (elsewhere in the notice of appeal the appellant refers to disputing his indebtedness to the second respondent and refers to the first respondent owing him $3106, the second respondent owing him $14,350 and $6333, and Manna Hill owing him $68,4000, and also claims that his shareholding in Manna Hill is worth $600,000; he apparently thereby identifies particular factual errors asserted, and complains that the learned Magistrate did not accept his evidence about why his statement of affairs was not accurate); (4) there were other sufficient causes for the petition to be dismissed, including (i) that he offered to repay the debt of $4600 but was not permitted by the respondents to do so; (ii) that the appellant had 'set-offs' against the respondents (referred to in (3) above); (iii) that he had an illness; and (iv) that the appeal against the earlier decision had not been resolved; (5) the appellant was not accorded procedural fairness because (i) he was not given sufficient time to present evidence and submissions, including by reason of the dismissal of the further evidence motion to adduce submissions and 'new' evidence regarding his 'real' statement of affairs, and because he received a very lengthy affidavit of the respondents on the afternoon of 5 April 2005 for the hearing on 8 April 2005; (ii) no weight was given to his state of health, namely his mental condition and its effect upon his capacity to conduct the hearing of the review application in a timely manner (the appellant did not claim that he was incompetent to conduct the hearing but that he should have been given more time to adduce evidence and to make submissions); (iii) he was not permitted to cross-examine the respondents' witnesses (whose evidence-in-chief was given by affidavit); (iv) he was not given an adjournment of the hearing of the review application to obtain legal representation (which he claims was available to him); (v) the hearing on 13 May 2005 was 'completed' whilst he was still in the course of making submissions; (vi) the learned Magistrate was ostensibly biased against him as indicated by (a) the general hostility he experienced during the hearing; (b) failing or declining to hear and determine the disqualification motion before delivering judgment; (c) commencing the hearing on 13 May 2005 before the listed commencement time in the presence of counsel for the respondents but in the absence of the appellant; (d) dismissing the further evidence affidavit (which the appellant claims, contrary to the assessment of the learned Magistrate, included evidence he wished to adduce and not simply submissions he wished to make); (e) selective use of evidence and failure to have regard to evidence favourable to the appellant in making the findings of fact.

20 The grounds of appeal in the draft notices of appeal attached to the two motions seeking leave to appeal from the dismissal of the further evidence motion and of the disqualification motion broadly speaking are included in the grounds of appeal from the dismissal of the review application. The only additional matter raised (which is itself comprehensible) is that the learned Magistrate should have treated the affidavit of the appellant of 14 June 2005 (filed in support of the further evidence motion) as also in support of the disqualification motion, so that his Honour erred in treating the disqualification motion as not complying with the Federal Magistrates Court Rules.

21 I have incorporated into the description of the grounds of appeal certain particularity which emerged from questioning the appellant during the course of the hearing of this appeal. I have not included certain matters which he raised in argument but which could not have led to the appeal (or other application) being successful (for example that certain evidence was apparently misplaced but then located in the course of the hearing at first instance, or that the result of the proceedings simply reflected the decision of 21 January 2005 under review without independent consideration, or that for a period during the hearing at first instance there was some misunderstanding about the foundation of the debt giving rise to the costs judgment).</text>

<tocase>Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347</tocase>
<text>22 In my view, the appellant was served with the bankruptcy notice and the petition by being given each of those documents. There was clear evidence to that effect. The appellant acknowledged that. There is no requirement that such documents at the time of service not be in a 'closed' or sealed envelope. The appellant pointed to no provision of the Act or of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 to support his contention, nor to any authority which does so. The service provisions under the Act are generally construed strictly: see, e.g. Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347. That reflects the need for certainty about if and when an act of bankruptcy has been committed, and the significance of a sequestration order.

23 There is no specific provision as to how service of a bankruptcy notice must be effected. Bankruptcy Regulation 16.01(1) provides a range of service options including personal service, and reg 16.01(b) then provides that personal service is effected when the document is delivered. There is no doubt the bankruptcy notice was delivered to the appellant.

24 As a Court process, service of the petition is governed by the relevant Court Rules. Rule 31.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules required the petition to be served personally by giving a copy to the appellant: Rules 6.06(1) and 6.07(1) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. That was complied with.</text>

<text>40 The review application required a rehearing de novo of the petition: see s 104 of the FM Act. Under s 35A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the review hearing therefore required the respondents to prove the various matters which they were also required to prove before the Registrar, including those specified in s 52(1) of the Act: see e.g. Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634; Meehan v Alfaro [1999] FCA 832 ; (1999) 93 FCR 201. The same approach applies under s 104 of the FM Act. There is no material difference in the two provisions. That approach has been adopted in the Federal Magistrates Court: see Adelaide Bank Ltd v Badcock [2002] FMCA 10 ; Clancy v Robinson [2002] FMCA 47.</text>

<text>72 The right to be heard is an important element of our system of justice. So too is the need for justice to be administered openly in the presence of the parties. The 'commencement' of the Court on 13 May 2005 was a little early and the appellant's arrival shortly afterwards understandably gave him cause for concern. However, as the material referred to above shows, the hearing of the review application had not commenced precisely because the appellant was not present and the time for its commencement had not been reached. The transcript reveals that. The appellant attended very shortly afterwards. I do not consider, in the circumstances, those events might reasonably cause a fair-minded lay observer to apprehend that the Magistrate might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the review application: see Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344.</text>

<tocase>GPI Leisure Corp Ltd v Herdsman Investments Pty Ltd (No.3) (1990) 20 NSWLR 15</tocase>
<text>76 Section 27 of the Evidence Act provides that a party may question any witness, except as provided by the Evidence Act . It is unclear that the common law position that there is no right of cross-examination (see e.g. per Young J in Eq in GPI Leisure Corp Ltd v Herdsman Investments Pty Ltd (No.3) (1990) 20 NSWLR 15 at 22) survives that provision. The practical outcome may be the same. Improper questioning may be disallowed: s 41. More importantly, s 11 of the Evidence Act preserves the power of a court to control the conduct of a proceeding, including with respect to abuse of its process. It is by the exercise of such a power that, in this instance, cross-examination of the process servers could have been precluded. It could have served no useful purpose, and would have added to the expense and length of the hearing for no valid reason. Similarly, the foundation for the costs judgment was a matter of record. There was clearly an act of bankruptcy committed by the appellant when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy notice based on the costs judgment. Cross-examination on the review application to endeavour to show that Lander J ought not to have made the orders in the earlier proceedings upon which the costs judgment was based would also have been pointless, and a waste of time and expense.

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>77 On the substantive issues raised in the review application under s 52(2) of the Act, it was a matter for the respondents as to whether they sought to cross-examine the appellant on his affidavits. They did not do so. The respondent's affidavits which preceded 30 March 2005 put the appellant on notice as to their case, and gave him the opportunity to respond. The judgment was made that the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 had been satisfied. The appellant has made no submission of unfairness in that regard.

78 The appellant's wish to cross-examine, in particular Ms Langford and the second respondent, related directly to the issue of solvency. To a significant degree, the learned Magistrate in fact avoided addressing contentious factual issues: he expressly assumed in favour of the appellant that the 212 shares in Manna Hill were the appellant's shares; he also disregarded the costs liability arising from the costs order following the outcome of the earlier proceedings.

79 The assessment of the appellant's debts as being between $75,000 and $100,000 was made, as the reasons for judgment show, upon the basis of the Statement of Affairs and the appellant's evidence (as distinct from his submissions) about that. The O'Riley 'debt' was about $12,000, so the reduction from the debts listed in the Statement of Affairs having regard to the appellant's evidence was of the order of $32,000-7000. That did not involve any assessment of the respective claims of the appellant and Ms Langford as to the amount of his debt to her; the disputed evidence was referred to and the Magistrate simply observed that the indebtedness is somewhere between $15,000 (the appellant's figure) and $67,000 (Ms Langford's figure). The reasons do not suggest an amount greater than $15,000 was taken into account. The learned Magistrate has therefore, on that contested evidence, taken the view based upon the appellant's own material. In that circumstance, he did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial by not permitting the appellant to cross-examine Ms Langford. There was no benefit to the appellant in him doing so, as the cross-examination would have legitimately sought to have the Magistrate accept the fact as to the amount of the indebtedness which the Magistrate assumed in any event.</text>
