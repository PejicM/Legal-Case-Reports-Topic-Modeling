<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>87 The following submissions were advanced by Idoshore as to the implications of that contribution which it made to Dr Fox warrant precise reproduction, as follows: 
 
 (i) 'Idoshore was induced to permit this transaction [to be implemented] on the clear condition and representation that Foundation would take forward the move to a larger location, the CBA building, which in turn would entitle Idoshore to a second Earn-Up with the profits of the economies of scale. Dr Fox was, on the evidence, a critical part of that overall plan for larger premises';
 (ii) '[a]gain, no evidence has been called to challenge either Mr O'Shanassy's account of the circumstances, or to demonstrate that Foundation had the present intention represented when the inducement was made, or that it had a reasonable basis for the representations'; based on the Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 principle of evidence, 'and (for the TPA claim) on s 51A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the failure to adduce evidence necessary to explain or demonstrate the truthfulness of the representation is fatal'; the representation having 'induced the payment, relief under sec 87 to order the restoration of the funds to Idoshore is an obvious remedy';
 (iii) '[f]urther, by reason that the payment was made pursuant to the undertaking to expand the business, which did not happen, the consideration for the payment wholly failed';
 (iv) '[t]he argument that there was simply a breach of contract by not moving, damages for which cannot be demonstrated, because there is no evidence as to what the income would have been in the new premises, invites the McRae v Commonwealth [ Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377] response that Idoshore having been deprived of the opportunity to show what the effect of a move would have been, because there was not a move, is entitled to recover the monies it paid on the warranty that there would be a move; in McRae the disappointed salvagers were entitled to recover the costs of the salvage expedition undertaken that discovered there was no tanker to salvage because the absence of a tanker prevented them showing what the profits might have been from that expenditure';
 (v) '[a]ccordingly, either in restitution for the sum paid on a pre-contractual misrepresentation, or because the consideration and purpose of the payment wholly failed; or because the conduct [of Foundation] was misleading and deceptive in circumstances undertaken within s 51A , the $210,000 removed from the warranty retention money must be returned to Idoshore's account and benefit together with interest'; 
 (vi) '[t]he simplest way of dealing with this in a case such as this is to treat the $210,000 warranty retention money as being intact in the hands of Foundation; in circumstances where the Court concludes (as is submitted) that Foundation has no right to retain any of that money for "warranty" breaches or for any other reason, it should be treated as a remaining part of the original purchase price not yet paid to Idoshore'. 

As I have foreshadowed, that sum of $210,000 comprised the sums of $125,000 and $85,000 referred to in [2] above, and the same did not as such lose their clause 10.5 character as the part of the 'Purchase Price' payable by Foundation to Idoshore for the 'Purchase' of the 'Business'. There is force in Idoshore's submission that the consideration for and purpose of the payment of the $210,000 failed, and that the totality of those warranty retention moneys should be returned to Idoshore beneficially. There is no evidence before the Court that challenges at least the substance of Mr O'Shanassy's account of the circumstances regarding the drawing down of the Warranty Security Deposit to pay 'one half of the sum demanded by Dr Fox'.</text>

<tocase>James v Australia And New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347</tocase>
<text>115 In any event, so Foundation's submissions continued, any representation to the effect that Foundation would work to grow the Business was asserted to have been made 'on reasonable grounds', Foundation emphasising that '... given Foundation's ongoing operation as a large public company operating many medical centres, [then] without direct proof of intention on the part of Foundation not to meet the Benchmark, the reasonable grounds are established', and further that '[i]t is not sufficient that matters represented may have been subject to a change of mind'. Foundation referred in that regard to dictum in James v Australia And New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Others (1986) 64 ALR 347 at 372 where Toohey J drew attention to principles to the effect that '[t] he mere fact that representations as to future conduct or events do not come to pass does not make them misleading or deceptive', though further that '[n]evertheless, a statement relating to the future may contain an implied statement as to present or past fact [and] may represent impliedly that the promisor has a present intention to make good the promise and it may represent impliedly that he has the means to do so' . Of course so much often depends upon the context to and the subject matter of a representation, but in any event Foundation submitted that the decision 'relating to relocation' was inherently of that general character.

116 In addressing the 'primary objective' theme of clause 3.9 of the Business Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement, that clause being the provision of the Agreement per se upon which Idoshore of course placed significant reliance, Foundation asserted that 'an objective' was to be distinguished from a guarantee or warranty and that clause 3.9 was 'couched in appropriate terms as an objective'. It was further contended that if the purpose of the clause was to provide a guarantee or warranty 'it would have been phrased in definitive terms'. Achievement of growth as such, without nomination or specification for instance of a minimum or maximum standard or parameters for the growth, carries somewhat imponderable implications of difficulty in a contractual setting such as clause 3.9. In any event that clause has significance independently concerning the making by Foundation of 'any material changes' without consultation or consent.

117 As to the operation of clause 3.10 of the Business Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement, which records the unspecific themes as to Foundation's stated intention '... to grow and expand the Business and, subject to clause 3.9, [not to] impede the Purchaser', Foundation submitted that the same constituted a 'motherhood' statement, since '[n]o purchaser would pay $1.125 million dollars for a business without intending to grow and expand it'. Nevertheless contractual significance should be assigned to that contractual acknowledgment, however confined in scope it may be. Foundation submitted further those contractual passages were not to be interpreted as saying that 'performance can be expected to automatically continue at existing levels or outstrip them'. Foundation was already engaged of course in business operations similar to, though apparently much more substantial than, those conducted by Idoshore at the OSMC at the time the Agreement was formed.</text>

<tocase>Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234</tocase>
<text>145 The first such restatement of principle cited by Idoshore was that enunciated by Priestly JA as a member of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in relation to a building and engineering contract in Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234 at 260:
 
 'There is nothing in the slightest novel in the implication of terms requiring reasonableness by parties to a contract in implementing terms of the contract.' 
 

And further at 268:
 
 'The result is that people generally... have grown used to the courts applying standards of fairness to contract which are wholly consistent with the existence in all contracts of a duty upon the parties of good faith and fair dealing in its performance. In my view this is in these days the expected standard, and anything less is contrary to prevailing community expectations.' 


In framing those principles, his Honour acknowledged the briefly reported dictum of Dixon J (as he then was) in Gullett v Gardner (1948) 22 ALJ 151, as follows:
 
 'This appeal depends upon the interpretation that should be placed upon a transaction of a somewhat curious nature between the two parties, the plaintiff and the defendant. It depends upon its interpretation in the wide sense; not the mere construction of the language in which it is expressed, but the extraction from the documents and the circumstances to which they refer and in which they were made of the full intention which the parties had or are to be considered as having with reference to the question now arising from the events that have occurred' (that emphasis appearing in the foregoing dictum was that of Dixon J). 


To similar effect was the dictum of Handley JA appearing in Renard at 280. Meagher JA reached the same outcome in decision-making, upon the operation of the contractual material addressed, as did Priestly and Handley JJA, though (at 275) his Honour rejected the notion '... that reasonableness could be imported as a limitation on the existence of cl 44 powers...' , upon the basis that '[s]uch a limitation, if it existed, could only arise either from the express words of the contract or by way of an implied term' .</text>

<tocase>Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/35.html</AustLII>
<text>146 Idoshore cited also what appeared more recently in the unanimous reasons of the High Court in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at 462 (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ), concerning the bearing of surrounding circumstances upon the construction of written contracts, as follows:
 
 'The construction of the letters of indemnity is to be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of Pacific would have understood them to mean. That requires consideration, not only of the text of the documents, but also the surrounding circumstances known to Pacific and BNP and the purpose and object of the transaction.'

147 The surrounding circumstances implicitly known to Idoshore and Foundation included the nature and extent of Idoshore's then existing business activities, described by the Agreement as the provision of 'facilities and services to medical practitioners to facilitate the conduct of their individual medical practices carried out in and from the Premises...', such premises being of course the subject of the medical operations of Idoshore's medical practitioners by the time of formation of the Business Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement. As I have foreshadowed, at the time of formation of the Agreement, Foundation was already itself engaged extensively in the operation of business activities of that general description, though on a much larger scale than Idoshore.

148 As I have already placed on record, Idoshore listed the following matters in summary as the principal focus of its case, being of course the case the subject of its several claims (I put aside for the moment Foundation's briefly framed cross-claim):
 
 '(a) the representations made to [Mr] O'Shanassy about exchanging a higher price for an Earn-Up provision;
 (b) the pre-contractual representations as to [Foundation's] intention to grow the Business [and] the Heads of Agreement;
 (c) the contractual provisions of the Business Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement setting out [Foundation's] intention to grow the Business; 
 (d) the express obligation [of Foundation] not to make any material change to the Business; and 
 (e) the contractual warranties by Idoshore as to maintenance of post acquisition EBITDA.' 

As to (a) above, the same is apparently a reference to representations made in the course of pre-contract negotiations, as is explicitly the case in (b) above.</text>
