<tocase>Purvis v State of New South Wales (Department of Education and Training) [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92</tocase>

<text>45 The respondent submitted further that there was no discrimination in relation to what it called the causation issue and the comparator issue. This terminology picks up what the High Court identified as two of the the three issues involved in determining whether there has been a contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act in Purvis v State of New South Wales (Department of Education and Training) [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92 at 152, and in particular, [194].

46 The relevant provision of the Disability Discrimination Act on which the applicant relies is s 15(2) of the Act, which reads as follows:
 "It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability or a disability of any of that employee's associates: (a) ... (b) ... (c) by dismissing the employee; (d) by subjecting the employee to any other detriment." 

That provision requires a reference to s 5(1) of the Act which is headed "Disability discrimination" and provides:
 "For the purpose of this Act, a person (discriminator) discriminates against another person (aggrieved person) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if, because of the aggrieved person's disability, the discriminator treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person without the disability." 

It is also important when looking at relevant provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act to refer to s 15(4) of the Act, which provides: 
 "Neither paragraph (1)(b) nor (2)(c) renders unlawful discrimination by an employer against a person on the ground of the person's disability, if taking into account the person's past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular employment and, if the person is already employed by the employer, the person's performance as an employee, and all other relevant factors that it is reasonable to take into account, the person because of his or her disability: 
 
 (a) would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular employment;"

47 The first question to ask by reference to the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act , is has the applicant been subjected to a detriment? The answer to that question depends upon the entitlement of the respondent to require the applicant to undergo an examination by a psychiatrist.</text>

<tocase>McManus v Scott-Charlton (1996) 70 FCR 16</tocase>
<text>48 The following principles are well established. An employer may give an employee a lawful and reasonable direction, and it is the common law obligation of an employee to obey the lawful and reasonable commands or directions of the employer. In McManus v Scott-Charlton (1996) 70 FCR 16 , Finn J said at 21:
 "The accepted view in this Court is that it is the common law obligation of an employee to obey the lawful and reasonable commands or directions of the employer: see Australian Telecommunications Commission v Hart (1982) 65 ALR 41 ; Bayley v Osborne (1984) 4 FCR 141 ; for a different view on the matter of reasonableness see 10 Halsbury's Laws of Australia, 'Employment', par 165-265, but cf W B Creighton, W J Ford and R J Mitchell, Labour Law (2nd ed, 1993), pars 8.2-8.8. ... The 'standard or test' of the lawfulness of a command or direction that has been adopted in this Court for common law purposes is that of Dixon J in R v Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co Ltd; Ex parte Halliday [1938] HCA 44 ; (1938) 60 CLR 601 at 621-622: 
 
 
 If a command relates to the subject matter of the employment and involves no illegality , the obligation of the servant to obey it depends at common law upon its being reasonable. In other words the lawful commands of an employer which an employee must obey are those which fall within the scope of the contract of services and are reasonable.' 
 (Emphasis added). 
 
... The need for some such limitation is patent: employment does not entail the total subordination of an employee's autonomy to the commands of the employer. As was said by the President in Australian Tramways Employees' Association v Brisbane Tramways Co Ltd (1912) 6 CAR 35 at 42: 
 
 'A servant has to obey lawful commands, not all commands. The servant does not commit a breach of duty if he refuse[s] to attend a particular church, or to wear a certain maker's singlets. The common law right of an employee is a right to wear what he chooses, to act as he chooses, in matters not affecting his work.' 
 
 There are obvious, and powerful, considerations of civil rights and liberties and of due process which inform this. These need not be laboured here although they are of no little significance in the resolution of this case."

49 It is also an established principle that it is reasonable to direct an employee to attend a medical examination to determine whether the employee is fit to perform his or her duties and whether he or she can do so safely. In Victoria, duties are cast upon employers by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic). Section 21 provides:
 
 
 "(1) An employer must, so far as is reasonably practicable, provide and maintain for employees of the employer a working environment that is safe and without risks to health." 
 
 (2) Without limiting sub-section (1), an employer contravenes that sub-section if the employer fails to do any of the following 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (d) provide, so far as is reasonably practicable, adequate facilities for the welfare of employees at any workplace under the management and control of the employer; 
 
 (e) provide such information, instruction, training or supervision to employees of the employer as is necessary to enable those persons to perform their work in a way that is safe and without risks to health." 
 
 


 
 Section 22(1) provides:
 "An employer must, so far as is reasonably practicable (a) monitor the health of employees of the employer; and 
 
 (b) monitor conditions at any workplace under the employer's management and control; and 
 
 
 
 (c) provide information to employees of the employer (in such other languages as appropriate) concerning health and safety at the workplace, including the names of persons to whom an employee may make an enquiry or complaint about health and safety."</text>

<tocase>Blackadder v Ramsay Butchering Services Proprietary Limited [2002] FCA 603 ; (2002) 118 FCR 395</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/603.html</AustLII>
<text>50 In Blackadder v Ramsay Butchering Services Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 603 ; (2002) 118 FCR 395 , Madgwick J considered the issue of a requirement of an employer in New South Wales for a reinstated employee to undergo a medical examination before reporting for work on reinstatement. Madgwick J said, at 411:
 "An employer has, as indicated above, strict obligations under the NSW legislation to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees. The importance of occupational health and safety is also reflected in the Act. Whilst an AWA, in general, prevails over conditions of employment specified in State laws to the extent of any inconsistency, provisions which relate to certain matters, such as occupational health and safety, operate subject to any relevant State law (see s 170VR(2) of the Act). It is in my opinion, essential for compliance with the above duties, that an employer be able, where necessary, to require an employee to furnish particulars and/or medical evidence affirming the employee's continuing fitness to undertake duties. Likewise, an employer should, where there is a genuine indication of a need for it, also be able to require an employee, on reasonable terms, to attend a medical examination to confirm his or her fitness. This is likely to be particularly pertinent in dangerous work environments. Abattoirs entail obvious risks, among other things, of injuries from the repetitive use of knives at speed, and to the spinal column from the necessity to twist, bend and/or lift. The question whether it is reasonable for an employer to request an employee to attend a medical examination will always be a question of fact as will the question of what are reasonable terms for the undertaking of the medical examination. The matters will generally require a sensitive approach including, as far as possible, respect for privacy. Nevertheless, I assume that there now should be implied by law into contracts of employment terms such as those set out in the first two sentences of the preceding paragraph, on the basis that such terms pass the test of 'necessity' accepted by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 450." 

Those observations of Madgwick J were not disturbed on appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court and finally on appeal to the High Court, which upheld Madgwick J's decision in whole: [2005] HCA 22 ; (2005) 221 CLR 539.

51 As I have already noted, an employer has an obligation under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic) to provide a safe place of work. In carrying out and discharging that obligation, an employer may, from time to time, need to assess and determine whether an employee suffers from a disability that might affect his work. The employer might need to have regard to the nature and consequences of the employee's disability in relation to the workplace in which the employee works.

52 As I noted earlier, s 15(4)(a) of the Disability and Discrimination Act does not render a dismissal unlawful where the disability prevents the employee from carrying out inherent requirements of his or her work. It is because of those matters that it is appropriate that an employer be able to obtain medical information about an employee that might be relevant to the performance of his or her work. It follows, in my view, that there are circumstances in which a requirement to provide medical information to one's employer, provided it is made on reasonable terms and is shown to be reasonably necessary, does not constitute a detriment in employment but is, as Madgwick J observed, a necessary part or an incident of the employment.

53 I consider such circumstances to be present here, where there is a history of absences due to a medical condition, where there are inconsistencies in the information available to the employer in relation to the state of the employee's health, and where there are a number of absences for which no details or reasons have been given. In this respect, I refer again to the absences that occurred on and between 5 December 2007 and 6 May 2008.

54 In my opinion, it was reasonable, and probably necessary, for the respondent in this case to find out more about the applicant's condition, which included the obtaining of a report from a psychiatrist, especially having regard to the unexplained absences.

55 I am satisfied that there is no serious issue to be tried as to whether the respondent has subjected the applicant to a detriment within the meaning of that expression in s 15(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act .

56 Even if there was a serious issue that the respondent has subjected the applicant to a detriment, it is necessary also for the applicant to establish that there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether the requirement of the employer entails discrimination on the ground of the disability. In this respect, I refer to s 5(1) of the Disability Discrimination Act , which requires there to be established that the applicant has been treated less favourably than the employer would treat a person without the disability. This raises what I called earlier the causation issue and the comparator issue.</text>
