<text>It is unnecessary for present purposes to resolve whether the written submission accurately expresses the basis upon which any discretion should be exercised or whether the more difficult task is the application of any discretion to the facts. Reservation is also presently expressed as to whether the present case is in any way analogous to the facts before the Full Court in SZKGF . There the question was whether an incorrect postcode upon correspondence, which was in any event received, constituted jurisdictional error. The delay of over seven years in SZIQB , and the other conduct of the claimant in that case, also seem far removed from the present case. Reference may also be made to the observations of Middleton J in SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 at [53] to [54] where His Honour indicated that relief may have been refused for a breach of s 441A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</text>

<text>The written submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister did not " urge upon the Court a duty to inquire into each case the extent to which any failure may have prejudiced an applicant ". What was urged upon the Court was the appropriateness " to withhold relief in circumstances where there is a clear absence of any practical injustice or even inconvenience to an applicant resulting from any error in question ". Reliance was placed upon SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 84 and SZIQB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 20.

<tocase>SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 122 , 102 ALD 54</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/122.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the Respondent Minister has properly referred to the following conclusion of Lander J in SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 122 , 102 ALD 541: 
 [97] It should only be in exceptional circumstances that a Court should refuse to issue the constitutional writs once the court has determined that the Tribunal has failed to comply with its imperative statutory obligations to an applicant seeking the review of a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant a protection visa. If it were otherwise, and the Court were required to inquire into the extent to which the failure by the Tribunal to comply with its statutory obligations to accord an applicant a fair hearing prejudiced the applicant, the imperative obligation imposed on the Tribunal might well be blunted. 

 
His Honour had there previously referred to the following observations of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 , 204 CLR 82.
 
 [57] It is one thing to refuse relief on the ground of utility because, as Lord Wilberforce put it, "[t]he court does not act in vain" ( Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation [1971] 1 WLR 1578 at 1595; [1971] 2 All ER 1278 at 1294). For example, the application for an administrative determination may be one which, irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits, the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse ( Mobil Oil Canada Ltd v Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board [1994] 1 SCR 202 at 228; Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law , 7 th ed (1994) at 528). Or the prosecutor's complaint may be the refusal by the decision-maker of an opportunity to make submissions on a point of law which must clearly have been answered unfavourably to the prosecutor (See Stead v State Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145). Again, the decision under review may have no legal effect and no continuing legal consequences may flow from it. In such a situation, the reasoning in Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; ((1992) 175 CLR 564 at 580-581), where the remedy refused was certiorari, indicates that prohibition will not lie ( Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 553-554 [113] ). 

 
 [58] However, the conditioning of a statutory power so as to require the provision of procedural fairness has, as its basis, a rationale which differs from that which generally underpins the doctrine of excess of power or jurisdiction. The concern is with observance of fair decision-making procedures rather than with the character of the decision which emerges from the observance of those procedures. Unless the limitation ordinarily implied on the statutory power is to be rewritten as denying jurisdictional error for "trivial" breaches of the requirements of procedural fairness, the bearing of the breach upon the ultimate decision should not itself determine whether prohibition under s 75(v) should go. The issue always is whether or not there has been a breach of the obligation to accord procedural fairness and, if so, there will have been jurisdictional error for the purposes of s 75(v). 

 
Moore and Marshall JJ agreed with Lander J.</text>

<tocase>SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 19</tocase>
<text>That subsequent application was rejected by a delegate of the Minister on 21 May 2008 and the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed that decision by a decision signed on 26 August 2008. An application for review was filed with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in September 2008. An amended application was filed on 14 November 2008 and identified two grounds, namely: 
(i) "The investigation conducted by the Second Respondent was affected by bias and preoccupied subjective reasoning "; and 
 
(ii) a breach of s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 
The amended application was dismissed: SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 18.

In dismissing the application, the Federal Magistrate relevantly concluded that: 
(a) the now Appellant failed to provide any evidence of any bias on the part of the Tribunal and the first ground set forth in the amended application was to be dismissed; and 
 
(b) a breach of s 91R(3) had in fact occurred; but that
 
(c) relief should be refused in the exercise of the Court's discretion.

The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court on 12 February 2009 raises essentially the same grounds as were advanced before the Federal Magistrate. Although the Notice of Appeal does not expressly assert error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in the exercise of discretion, the written Outline of Submissions as filed by the Respondent Minister correctly addresses the question as to whether the discretionary withholding of relief has miscarried.</text>

<tocase>Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 319</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/319.html</AustLII>
<text>The expression, " the interests of justice ", as employed in Rule 4(1) is a " wide term ": Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 319 at [10] per French J. As His Honour there made clear, the decision to issue a referral is no indication by the Court of the strengths or weaknesses of a particular case.

In the present proceeding it is considered that it is in " the interests of the administration of justice " that a referral be made. A person seeking refugee status in Australia who has established a breach of an important provision of the Migration Act 1958 is not to be lightly denied relief. The significance to be attached to a breach of s 91R(3) and the importance of that provision to the decision-making process need to be addressed. The proper basis upon which any such discretion should be exercised, and whether it is appropriate when exercising that discretion for the Federal Magistrate to himself embark upon an assessment of the weight of the evidence before the Refugee Review Tribunal, are both matters in respect to which the Court would be greatly assisted by hearing from a legal practitioner on the Pro Bono Panel.

Although it may well be that the ground of appeal alleging bias on the part of the Tribunal is not a ground that is ultimately relied upon, it is not considered appropriate at this stage to confine the assistance that may be provided pursuant to O 80 r 5. The legal practitioner to whom this matter is referred may abandon some grounds or seek to raise grounds not presently identified. Such matters will be matters for the professional judgment of the legal practitioner concerned.</text>
