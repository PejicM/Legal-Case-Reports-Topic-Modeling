<text>17 As to the claim that the Tribunal's conclusions were not based on a rational or logical foundation, it must first be said that there is something of a controversy as to whether this is a ground of jurisdictional error. In VWST v The Minister for Immigration and Multi-cultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 286 , 10 November 2004, a Full Court of this Court held that the current state of the law is that want of logic in the reasons of the Tribunal is not an available ground of review, see para 18.</text>

<text>18 That Court did so, having considered, materially, a then recently given decision of the High Court, Re: Minister for Immigration and Multi-cultural Affairs, ex parte S20 of 2002 (2003) 77 ALJR 1165. I note that the learned authors of Aronson and others , at page 265 state of this decision of the High Court that it, " approved review for irrationality or illogicality ." There is, with respect, certainly reason so to regard the High Court's decision in S20 ; see para 52 in the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ, with which, at para 173, Callinan J agreed; see also para 138 in the reasons of judgment of Kirby J. Even assuming, though, that want of logic or irrationality is a permissible ground of jurisdictional error review, this is not a case, in my opinion, in which such a ground can be made out.

19 There were manifest inconsistencies of the kind highlighted by the Tribunal in its correspondence, and subsequent reasons. Those reasons, having regard to the inconsistencies highlighted, do provide a logical and rational basis upon which the Tribunal could have concluded, as it did, that it was not satisfied that the claim for a protection visa had been made out.

20 The final ground of challenge is that the Tribunal did not take into account the information provided in response to the s 424A letters by the appellant. As I have mentioned, though, these letters were expressly quoted in the Tribunal's reasons, and it is evident that the information was taken into account by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusions.</text>
