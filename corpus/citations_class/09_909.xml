<tocase>W148/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 679 ; (2001) 185 ALR 703</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/679.html</AustLII>
<text>The Magistrate treated this as a complaint that the Tribunal placed too much weight on the findings of fact upon which it based its conclusion that the applicant's evidence was not credible. I think that is the correct complexion to put upon this ground. But again it is not a procedural fairness complaint. In any event, the Magistrate rejected it because the Tribunal's findings on which its conclusion on credibility were based were open to it on the evidence. After referring to a number of authorities on findings as to credibility, his Honour said at [28] that the Tribunal had not failed to use, or had palpably misused, the advantage it had of having heard and seen the applicant give evidence. Nor had it acted on evidence that was inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence or which was glaringly improbable. Nor were the probabilities strongly against the findings it made in rejecting the applicant's evidence. See W148/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 679 ; (2001) 185 ALR 703 at [64] .

In connection with this ground the applicant asserts a breach by the Tribunal of s 414 of the Migration Act 1958 in not assessing her claims in the manner the section requires. Section 414(1) requires the Tribunal to review a valid application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision. The Magistrate correctly rejected this complaint. He said at [49]-[50]: 
 the RRT performed its duty under s 414 to consider the claims made by the applicant and the evidence before it. The RRT considered the evidence of the applicant given to the Department and the oral evidence given at the hearing. The RRT considered and accepted her claim that, as a Hindu, the applicant genuinely cares about the welfare of cows and may have assisted her grandfather in this regard. However, the Tribunal rejected the rest of the applicant's claims. Those findings were open to it on the evidence before it ... 

 
 This ground is an attempt to review factual findings by the Tribunal which is not open to a Court conducting judicial review. 

 
No error has been shown in the Magistrate's rejection of reliance on s 414. The Tribunal carefully considered her claims and the evidence she provided in support of them. There is no doubt that it "reviewed" the Tribunal's decision as required by s 414. No error has been shown in the Magistrate's rejection of ground 1.2. There is no prospect that the applicant would establish this ground on an appeal.

Ground 2 is that the Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Tribunal acted in a manifestly unreasonable manner when dealing with the applicant's claims because of its failure to consider them in accordance with Article 1(A)(2) of the Refugee Convention and "ignoring the aspect of persecution or serious harm in terms of s 91R of the Act". There is no substance in these complaints. The Magistrate pointed out, correctly, that at the beginning of its reasons the Tribunal set out the relevant law, the definition of refugee in Article 1(A)(2), and key components of the definition. It then dealt with the applicant's claims in accordance with the relevant criteria before concluding at [64] that it was not satisfied that she is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations.</text>

<text>Ground 3 is that the Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in failing to request more information regarding the applicant's activities in the Gitaben Rambhia Trust from the Trust itself. The Magistrate dismissed this complaint. In reliance on High Court and Full Court authority he observed that there is no obligation on the Tribunal to obtain further information. Section 424 empowers the Tribunal to obtain information, but it does not have a duty to investigate an applicant's claims. See SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [61] . This ground has no prospect of success.

In her written submissions the applicant asserts another claim of want of procedural fairness, in that at [55], [57]-[59] and [61]-[62] of his reasons the Magistrate "failed to address the mandatory nature of the requirements of [s 65(1)], and in effect applied the test of compliance with the common law rules of natural justice to a statutory scheme". The Magistrate's reasons conclude at [59]. None of the paragraphs relied on deal with procedural fairness. However at [16] his Honour stated that s 422B(1) provides that Division 4 is an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule, and that no breach of that Division had been shown. The applicant's complaint that the codified natural justice scheme was not applied is baseless.</text>

<tocase>SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1389.html</AustLII>
<text>In her written submission's the applicant claims that the Tribunal in failing to make specific findings failed to reach the required state of satisfaction or non-satisfaction as required by s 65(1). This complaint has no basis in fact. The Tribunal made specific findings about the claims and evidence before it. As it explained at [57] to [63] of its reasons, it did not accept most of those claims and evidence. The Magistrate said, correctly in my view, that once the Tribunal had found that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria for a visa, it was not required to make findings on all other matters that may have been raised in evidence. A Tribunal is not required to refer in its reasons to every item of evidence before it. Thus a failure to refer to a particular piece of evidence does not require a conclusion that it has been overlooked: SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 at [58] . I need not pursue this matter further, because the applicant provided no particulars of the specific findings she said the Tribunal should have made.</text>

<text>In my view none of the grounds in the draft notice of appeal or the written submissions has any prospect of success. All of them are quite without merit and would be bound to fail if an extension of time within which to appeal were granted. They have been propounded without any reference to the contents of the reasons of the Magistrate from whose decision the applicant seeks leave to appeal. Accordingly I refuse to grant an extension because it would be pointless to do so. Cf SZJDA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1093.
