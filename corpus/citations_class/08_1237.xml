<tocase>ASIC v Southcorp Ltd [2003] FCA 804 , 46 ACSR 438</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/804.html</AustLII>
<text>8 In ASIC v Southcorp Ltd [2003] FCA 804 at [21] , [2003] FCA 804 ; 46 ACSR 438 at 441 2 Lindgren J helpfully formulated the principles to be applied in a case such as the present. In particular, His Honour there formulated two of those principles as being:
 (3) Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness, such as working notes, field notes, and the witness's own drafts of his or her report, do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of, and would not expose, communications: cf Interchase [Corp Ltd (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1999] 1 Qd R 141] at 161 2 per Thomas J. (4) Ordinarily disclosure of the expert's report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in (1) and (2) above, at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report, because, in these circumstances, it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief, instructions or documents...

9 For the purposes of resolving the present claims for privilege, an inference may be drawn that the " handwritten annotations " of Ms Chylek most probably contain observations in respect to the email or the draft expert report then before her. The onus upon the Fifth Respondent of establishing privilege, albeit on minimal material, has been made out. Those handwritten annotations it is thus considered are privileged, as is Document 2, the email from Ms Chylek to the expert.

10 The documents, it may generally be accepted, were confidential.

12 Documents 9 and 11 are draft expert reports. The draft expert reports, however, are not considered to be privileged and the onus imposed upon the Fifth Respondent to establish the claim has not been discharged. A draft report from an expert, together with a communication from an expert to a solicitor, " do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of, and would not expose, communications " per Lindgren J. Nor, if it be relevant, is there any evidence that the draft reports were given for the purpose of obtaining the input of the solicitors: New Cap Reinsurance Corp Ltd (in liq) v Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd [2007] NSWSC 258. That was a case arising under s 119 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and not the common law. All that is known of the draft reports in the present proceeding is simply that, namely they are " draft reports ". Nothing is known as to the reasons why such drafts were prepared and nothing is known as to whether the disclosure of a draft report prepared by the independent expert would disclose anything other than the contents of a draft of a report which was subsequently filed and served. Indeed, Senior Counsel for the Fifth Respondent accepted that privilege would not attach to a document if all that was known was that it was a " Draft Report " which was forwarded in confidence.</text>

<text>3 In Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 688 9, it will be recalled that Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ summarised the position as follows:
 It is well accepted that the court in allowing production and inspection of documents exercises a judicial discretion. In so doing it needs to scrutinize with care claims of privilege made on the ground now under consideration. It is for the party claiming privilege to show that the documents for which the claim is made are privileged. He may succeed in achieving this objective by pointing to the nature of the documents or by evidence describing the circumstances in which they were brought into existence. But it should not be thought that the privilege is necessarily or conclusively established by resort to any verbal formula or ritual. The court has power to examine the documents for itself, a power which has perhaps been exercised too sparingly in the past, springing possibly from a misplaced reluctance to go behind the formal claim of privilege. It should not be forgotten that in many instances the character of the documents the subject of the claim will illuminate the purpose for which they were brought into existence.
