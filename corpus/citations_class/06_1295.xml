<tocase>Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/71.html</AustLII>
<text>The Chief Federal Magistrate was alleged to have erred in failing to grant constitutional writ relief or prerogative relief on the following bases; first, that the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error in failing correctly to identify the appellant's claims and to apply the decision in Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473. Secondly, that in reaching its conclusion the Tribunal failed to give the appellant a notice in writing under s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) of information which it took into account which was not information that fell within an exception found in subs (3) of that section.

The information was characterised in two ways; first, that the appellant in her protection visa application had not made clear to the Tribunal how she would practice Falun Gong if she returned to China; and secondly, that while she had said that she had a fear of persecution, on the other hand she had offered very little in support of that. Each type of information was said to be information within the meaning of s 424A(1) in the manner I will explain in more detail shortly. The third ground was that the Tribunal had erred in the exercise of its discretion under s 426A when it failed to consider making contact with or contacting the appellant after she had failed to attend a hearing in circumstances where previously she had advised the Tribunal that she did intend to attend.

The appellant had arrived in Australia in February 1997. In August 2000 she had lodged an application for a protection visa with the Minister. A delegate of the Minister refused to grant her a protection visa in September 2000 and she applied for a review of that decision on 3 October 2000. The basis of her claim was set out in a statement which she made in the application for the visa. She said that she had become a practitioner of Falun Gong in May 1998 in Australia.

She pointed to the fact that as far as she knew, all Falun Gong practitioners suffered persecution in China and that many of them had been jailed, many detained and those who might not be detained or arrested could be suffering mentally from discrimination and could have been discriminated against by the Chinese authorities in their employment or through some forms of administrative punishment. In her claims she explained that she attended a Falun Dafa Australian experience sharing convention in May 1998 and thereafter became attracted to the practice of Falun Gong.

She said that she claimed to have gone to Darling Harbour every Saturday and that she had read books by a master of Falun Gong and obeyed the other laws of that set of beliefs. She claimed that by practising Falun Gong her health became better and she had received mental cultivation and enlightenment. She also claimed to have attended another Falun Dafa Australian experience sharing conference in May 1999 and then in May 2000, to have participated in what she said was the world's first Falun Dafa day in Australia. On that occasion she said that with approximately 300 other practitioners she had walked from Hyde Park in Sydney to Darling Harbour and had held up banners with laudatory statements about Falun Dafa.

In Appellant S395 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at 489 [40] McHugh and Kirby JJ said: 
 
 'Persecution covers many forms of harm ranging from physical harm to the loss of intangibles, from death and torture to State sponsored or condoned discrimination in social life and employment. Whatever form the harm takes, it will constitute persecution only if, by reason of its intensity or duration, a person persecuted cannot reasonably be expected to tolerate it. But persecution does not cease to be persecution for the purpose of the Convention because those persecuted can eliminate the harm by taking avoiding action within the country of nationality.'

The real problem in this case is that the appellant made claims that she was a Falun Gong practitioner, that she wished to practice if she were to return to China and that she would be placed at risk. But she had failed to satisfy the Tribunal on the material she placed before it of the way in which she was proposing to practice if returned, so that it could be apparent whether or not she would be put in a position on either of the two horns of the dilemma which she presented to the Tribunal or of being a person who would be forced to modify the way in which she practised her beliefs to escape coming to the attention of the authorities.

While other decision makers may have viewed her claims differently from the way in which the Tribunal did, it was for the Tribunal to be satisfied of them or not. I see no error in the way in which it exercised its function of review that affected the jurisdictional foundation on which the Tribunal proceeded. I am of opinion that the Tribunal did look at what has been called the dilemma, albeit without expressly identifying it in the passage to which I have referred, in which it ultimately said that it was not clear how the appellant would practice Falun Gong were she returned to China and, therefore, it could not be clear to the Tribunal whether she would be affected at all and, if so, in what manner.</text>

<tocase>Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The first function of the Tribunal in a review of a decision whether to grant a protection visa is to identify the claims made by the applicant for review. Correct identification of a claim is essential to enable the Tribunal effectively to exercise the jurisdiction which the Parliament has confided it to exercise under s 414(1) of the Act: see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 394-395 [26] - [27] per Gummow and Callinan JJ.

What the Tribunal did was to set out in a section headed, 'Claims and Evidence', the fact that it had before it the Department's file. It then referred to the original application and to her claim that she feared she may be persecuted if she returned to China as she now practised Falun Gong and that she had been aware that many Falun Gong practitioners in China had been arrested.

The Tribunal recorded that the appellant had started practising Falun Gong in May 1998 and had attended the Convention at that time. It referred to her insisting on attending Darling Harbour every Saturday to perform exercises and that she read books by the founder of Falun Gong and obeyed Falun Gong's laws. It recorded that she had attended other public outing of the Falun Gong organisation in Australia.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996)185 CLR 259</tocase>
<text>It is important in considering the reasons of the Tribunal that the court should not be concerned with the looseness in language or unhappy phrasing. Its reasons are not to be construed minutely and with an eye keenly tuned to a perception of error. As Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272, the reality is that the reasons of administrative decision-makers are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over zealous judicial review by seeming to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed. Relevantly for seeking the present context, their Honours said: 
 
 '... any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision.'

An administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is regarded in law as no decision at all: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 614-615 [51] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 618 [63] McHugh and at 646-647 [152] per Hayne J. In the latter case the Tribunal had failed to have drawn to its attention at the time it made its decision a communication from the applicant for review that he was unable to attend because of illness. It later embarked on a further review of his case and the court upheld that exercise on the ground that the Tribunal initially had not performed a review at all because it failed to have regard to the applicant for review's communication to it and had not decided in accordance with the Act.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/73.html</AustLII>
<text>Here the Act gave the Tribunal the discretion to proceed or not once the appellant did not appear on 22 March 2001. The Tribunal did not have to give reasons for its exercise of discretion under s 426A because s 430 of the Act did not require it to do so. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73 at [27] , the full court held that where the Tribunal had sent to an applicant for a review, at his address for service, a letter inviting him to a hearing in accordance with ss 425 and 425A in circumstances where s 422B was not then in force, the mere fact that the Tribunal received the letter back with a return to sender endorsement did not oblige the Tribunal to do anything further to search in its files to see other addresses at which the applicant may be contacted. Their Honours said ([2006] FCAFC 73 [38]-[39]): 
 
 'The respondent says the Tribunal was on notice that he may not have received the letter because the "Response to Hearing Invitation" form was not returned, because the letter to his residential address was returned unclaimed, and because he did not appear at the hearing. The respondent says that in these circumstances, the Tribunal was obliged under s 425 to search both its own and the Department file to attempt to find another method of contacting the respondent. He says that in this case, the Tribunal had an obligation to contact the migration agent listed if the respondent's Department file to find more recent contact details, and possibly also to ring the residential telephone number contained in the respondent's protection visa application. 
 
 The submissions of the respondent in this respect are rejected. In view of the decision in VNAA it is clear that ss 425 and 425A of the Migration Act are to be read together. Accordingly, the Tribunal, having complied with one of the methods prescribed in s 425A (in fact, two) was under no further obligation to search the papers lodged with it to discover if there might be some other avenue of communicating with the applicant.'

The appellant distinguishes that decision on the basis that this matter had proceeded one stage further in that the appellant had been contacted, and had indicated she wished to attend the hearing. The obligation under s 425 , at the time at which the appellant's claim came to be considered by the Tribunal, was to invite the appellant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. That was complied with. Whether the appellant took up the invitation seems to me to be a matter for the appellant at the end of the day. The Tribunal's obligation had been discharged.



I think that a construction of s 426A(1) that obliged the Tribunal to accord natural justice to an applicant for review if they did not appear in accordance with s 426A(1)(b) , was at odds with the express words of the discretion in the section. Those words are that: 
 
 '[It] may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it.'

It seems to me to be quite inconsistent with those words to construe the obligations of procedural fairness to require the decision maker to give the applicant an opportunity to retrieve his or her position after a failure to appear in that situation.</text>

<tocase>NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/134.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant also referred to the decision of the Full Court in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51. There, Madgwick J, with whom Conti J agreed, had noted that the court could reasonably attribute to the delegate, whose decision was then under challenge, knowledge of the notorious background facts about China, that it was an authoritarian, indeed a politically, though not now economically, totalitarian State (see 147 FCR at 94 [220]). He said that while the delegate in that case had accepted, apparently, that active proponents or leaders of Falun Gong as opposed to ordinary practitioners would be more likely to come to the attention of the authorities, in the circumstances of that case the appellant's claims as to events in Australia indicated that she in fact had been an active proponent of Falun Gong. In those circumstance the delegate's express lack of satisfaction that she had been identified by Chinese authorities could hardly have betokened any confident and complete rejection of that proposition. This led to a finding that the decision maker in that case had misunderstood the task which he was required to undertake (see 147 FCR 94-95 [221]-[222]).

I do not think that the facts of that case are sufficiently analogous or in point on the present facts to lead to a conclusion in support of the first ground.

For these reasons, I therefore reject the first ground.

Turning to the second ground, it was said that the provisions of s 424A(1) were engaged so as to require the Tribunal to give the appellant notice in writing that it intended to use as the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review parts of its reasoning or fact finding as to how the appellant may or may not practice Falun Gong and the Tribunal's lack of satisfaction about that were she to return to China. Further, and alternatively, it was argued that the Tribunal should have given her notice that it would use the fact or reasoning that she had offered very little support for those claims even in the form of evidence which she herself could give.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1045.html</AustLII>
<text>I am fortified in this construction of s 426A by a decision of Greenwood J in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 , especially at [24]. The matter may also be tested by considering whether, if the Tribunal had decided to make attempts to contact the appellant on her failure to attend on 21 March 2001, the Minister could have attacked that conduct on the ground that a jurisdictional error occurred. In my opinion it could not.

It was plain that the Tribunal had a discretion one way or the other to decide whether or not to take further action. I do not think that it could be inferred or implied that the requirements of procedural fairness necessitated the Tribunal, in arriving at a decision under s 426A(1) to consider contacting the appellant, and, if it failed to do so, the whole of the exercise of its jurisdiction would be thrown into doubt. The very terms of the section seem to me to negate such an approach.

I do not see any error in the way in which the Chief Federal Magistrate approached this issue. For these reasons I reject this ground.</text>

<tocase>SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/2.html</AustLII>
<text>Whether or not something is information of the kind which is within the definition in section 424A has been the subject of considerable debate in the authorities. Relevantly, the Full Court has held in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 259 [205] per Allsop J; Weinberg J agreeing at 150 FCR at 252 [155] and see too at 259-260 [200]-[210] that: 
 
 'Information is that of which one is told or apprised; it is knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject or event.' 
 

Allsop J went on to say:
 
 'Information does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations.'

There he acknowledged the distinction between those matters and information could be fine, but obviously it is critical. And he identified that the word 'information' has been said not to encompass or extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail of specificity in evidence or conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps. However, that process was somewhat limited by a proper construction of the legislation (see 150 FCR 259-260 [206]-[207]).

The way in which the Tribunal expressed its reasons, subject to one qualification to which I will come, appears to me to display an evaluative process of the claims and the lack of material put before the Tribunal in support of those claims. The Tribunal expressed itself as not being satisfied about a number of matters. It did make a positive finding based on the country information, as it was entitled to do under s 424A(3)(a), that there was differential attention by the Chinese authorities to practitioners of Falun Gong and that various factors could influence whether or not someone was persecuted and how they were persecuted.</text>

<tocase>SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1195.html</AustLII>
<text>In SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 Allsop J referred to the reasons a Tribunal had given in that case that the appellant had not provided the level of detail necessary satisfactorily to establish the relevant facts in his case. The Tribunal there noted that questions remained unanswered as to how and when the homosexuality which he there alleged had come about, and become known and the like. At the end the Tribunal concluded it was not satisfied that the appellant's claims were true. His Honour said ([2005] FCA 1195 at [29]): 
 
 'The Tribunal, having read all the material and having evaluated its content and weight, was unable to reach a specified mental state. It was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear because of subjectively perceived inadequacies in the information. The reason for the decision was simply (and no more than that) the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited. It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision. It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason.'

Accordingly, his Honour found that in that case there was no failure to comply with s 424A. Although my mind has wavered on the point, I am of opinion that the better view is that the Tribunal's use of the failure of the appellant to give evidence is to be viewed in a similar fashion. At the end of the day the Tribunal concluded that on the very limited information available it was not satisfied that the appellant would be at risk of persecution were she to return to China or that there was any real chance that she would be persecuted if she did. Notwithstanding my doubts, I find that the Tribunal was not obliged to give a notice under s 424A(1) and that I should dismiss this ground of appeal.

Last, it is said that the Tribunal failed to exercise a discretion under s 426A(1) in accordance with the Act and thereby committed a jurisdictional error. The appellant argues that the Tribunal ought to have had regard to the fact that she had indicated she wished to attend a hearing but, because she did not arrive, it ought to have taken the simple step of telephoning her on the telephone number which the Tribunal had to ascertain whether or not there was some reason for her non-attendance.

I am asked to infer from material in the appellant's affidavit which was unchallenged before his Honour that had she been telephoned on the day of the hearing she would have attended the hearing and/or made arrangements to seek an adjournment with the Tribunal. The appellant did not state that explicitly in her affidavit of 16 March 2006. I infer that she had considerable concerns about her immigration status and continued to liaise and speak with people at the Shine Business Consultant Centre at all relevant times. While I might be prepared to infer in her favour that she would in fact have communicated to the Tribunal that she wanted a hearing and sought to arrange a convenient time either on the day fixed for the hearing or at some other time, the first question is what was the scope of the discretionary power in s 426A?

The Minister submits that considerations which the Tribunal was bound to take into account are those specified in s 426A(1)(a) and (b), namely, that a proper invitation had been given to the appellant to appear at a hearing before the Tribunal under s 425 and the appellant had not appeared before the Tribunal on the day on which, or at the time and place at which, she was scheduled to appear. The Minister argues that s 426A(2) is, in effect, facultative in allowing the Tribunal to re-schedule the time of an appellant's appearance to enable him or her to appear at a later or an alternate time but that subs (2) does not, in effect, create some consideration which the Tribunal is bound to take into account in exercising its discretion.</text>

<tocase>SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 538</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/538.html</AustLII>
<text>This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 538. In essence, three principal bases of error were argued before me.

I am of opinion that although the reasons of the Tribunal could have been better expressed, the Chief Federal Magistrate made no error in his conclusion that the Tribunal had made no finding that the appellant was a practitioner of Falun Gong or that she had practised that faith in a particular way. He said that there was no finding that upon her return to China she would practice in a particular way and that it was apparent that the Tribunal was unable to make those findings because of her non attendance before the it and the lack of information in support of her claim (see [2006] FMCA 538 at [16] ).

From time to time decisions of the Tribunal refer to questions which it might have been able to ask of persons had they attended hearings. The courts have held that that speculation does not amount to a jurisdictional error or a failure to comply with s 424A(1). I am mindful that in this case the requirements of the Act for according natural justice are not exhaustive because what came later to be enacted in s 422B was not in force at the time the Tribunal made its decision. Thus the common law requirements of procedural fairness to the extent that they are consistent with the Act had to be observed by the Tribunal in addition to those mandated in the statute. I am of opinion that the Tribunal did take into account the fact that the appellant had not given evidence in support of her claims, and the fact that she did not attend the hearing, as information to why it would find against her. The Chief Federal Magistrate thought this ground in totality was misconceived (see [2006] FMCA 538 at [19] ).

In one sense in every case where an applicant for review does not attend a hearing part of the material before the Tribunal is the failure to attend and to give evidence in support of the claim. But here the Tribunal gave as a reason that the appellant had, in effect, not only given little support to her claims, she had not given evidence to support them. At no time did the Tribunal give notice to the appellant that her failure to give evidence in support of her claims would be a reason for rejecting them. Rather it had sent a notice saying that it was not satisfied on the material before it that it could make a decision in her favour and invited her to a hearing, as it was required under the Act to do before it could proceed along that course.

To employ the appellant's failure to give evidence in support of her claims as a part of the reason why her claim should not be accepted seems to me to be using that information against her in a way that she was not advised of beforehand. Albeit she was on notice that the Tribunal was not going to make a decision in her favour, it was not because she had not given evidence. It was because the Tribunal was not satisfied on the material that she had presented to it. The distinction is fine and difficult and I am not entirely sure that it is satisfactory given that the Act envisages that the very purpose of inviting someone to a hearing is to enable them to persuade by what they can say and provide at the hearing, the Tribunal against upholding the decision to refuse a visa.</text>
