<text>6 The Federal Magistrate found that there was no arguable jurisdictional error affecting the Tribunal's decision. His Honour found that the Tribunal had complied with its obligations under ss 425 and 425A of the Act and that it was sufficient for the Tribunal to send an invitation to the authorised recipient pursuant to ss 441A(4) and 441G (1) of the Act and Reg 4.35D of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ("the Regulations "). The Federal Magistrate was not satisfied that the Tribunal had not followed those procedures and considered that it was probable that it did. He noted that the appellant was seeking to take advantage of his failure to comply with the instructions contained in Section D of the form on which he applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. Section D asked the applicant: "Where do you want us to send correspondence about your application?" Various options appeared in the form. An applicant was instructed to "tick one box only." Despite this the appellant had ticked the boxes adjacent to "my residential address in Australia" and a box which authorised correspondence in connection with the review to be received by "my adviser". The Federal Magistrate held that the requirements of the Act relating to the giving of notice of a hearing had been satisfied by the advice given to the adviser notwithstanding the Tribunal's failure also to advise the appellant directly. His Honour relied on his decision in Song v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 685. The Federal Magistrate was prepared to accept that the appellant did not have actual notice, but considered that, if preconditions for the exercise of its power exist and the Tribunal has properly exercised its discretion to proceed, then it has no obligation to make further enquiries or efforts to notify an applicant that it proposed to do so.

7 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had taken into account the contents of the telephone conversation with the appellant's migration agent before deciding to proceed pursuant to s 426A(1) of the Act , but that there was no breach of s 424A(1) of the Act because the Tribunal did not take the information into account in order to affirm the delegate's decision. However, his Honour considered that, even if this conclusion were incorrect, the information from the appellant's migration agent would be treated as information given by the appellant and would attract the exception provided for in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act .</text>
