<text>1 By a notice of appeal filed on 21 April 2008, the appellant has attempted to appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in Pothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 345. The judgment was given on 31 March 2008. The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the first respondent to that proceeding, also the first respondent to this proceeding, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.

2 The history of the proceeding is as follows. The appellant made an application to the relevant department on 1 August 1997 for a visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") of the kind known as a Sri Lankan (Temporary) (Class TT) visa. The reason for the application appears to have been that a previous visa that had been granted to the appellant had expired on 31 July 1997. A delegate of the then relevant Minister refused to grant the visa. The appellant applied to the Migration Internal Review Office, which affirmed the delegate's decision.

3 The letter by which the appellant was advised of this decision informed the appellant that he needed to make an application for review by the Immigration Review Tribunal within 28 days of the date of the letter. The time period was calculated on the basis of reg 5.03 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), which was later found to be an invalid regulation. It was also later held by this Court that a failure to give a notice complying with s 66(2) of the Migration Act , because of a failure to state accurately the time limit in which an application to review could be made, led to the conclusion that the obligation imposed by s 66 was never discharged and there was no valid notification of the decision. On this basis, in the absence of a statutory time limit, the application for review of the decision refusing a visa was revived many years later, when it came before the Migration Review Tribunal.</text>

<text>6 The federal magistrate then proceeded to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. It seems clear that a judgment given on such a basis is an interlocutory judgment for the purposes of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and that the leave of the Court or a judge is therefore required before an appeal can be brought from such a judgment. The relevant provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and the relevant principles are set out conveniently in the judgments of Rares and Gordon JJ in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and Others [2008] FCAFC 60 (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [42] - [72] and [159]-[191] respectively.

7 Accordingly, there seems little doubt that the appellant needed to have leave to appeal. He was so advised both by the Australian Government Solicitor, acting on behalf of the first respondent, and by the registry of the Court itself, but did not file any application for leave to appeal. By O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules , such an application needed to be made within 21 days after the judgment was pronounced, subject to the fixing of any later date. Not only has the appellant not attempted to make any application for leave to appeal, he has not made any application for the fixing of a later date than that prescribed by O 52 r 5, by which he might do so.

8 It was reported to me yesterday that the appellant's daughter came to the registry of the Court, handed over a bundle of material relating to the appellant's health, and informed the registry that the appellant would be unable to appear at the hearing of this proceeding today. The appellant certainly has not appeared in response to his name being called outside the courtroom. The material consists of a letter from the appellant, dated 26 August 2008, to the registrar of this Court, and a number of attachments.</text>
