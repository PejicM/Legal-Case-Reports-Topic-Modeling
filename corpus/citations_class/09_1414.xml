<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 420 of the Act is a facultative non-restrictive provision. Its purpose is to free tribunals, at least to some degree, from constraints otherwise applicable to courts of law and regarded as inappropriate to tribunals ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [49] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J). Section 420 informs the grounds of review specified in s 476 of the Act but has only an indirect effect on review proceedings ( Eshetu at [76] per Gaudron and Kirby JJ). That is, the section does not impose procedures the breach of which gives rise to a ground of review ( Eshetu at [77]) per Gaudron and Kirby JJ).

In any event, even if the appellant were to establish that the Tribunal made a "significant mistake", that does not necessarily establish jurisdictional error. The fact that, theoretically, another Tribunal may have reached a different decision on the claims as presented by the appellant does not mean that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 420.

The ground of appeal based on a contravention of s 420 is not made out. Ground 2 access to legal advice</text>

<text>It is apparent that the appellant disagrees with the factual findings of the Tribunal. That does not provide a basis for the serious allegation of actual bias, nor does it indicate that the Tribunal had a mind ' incapable of alteration ' or that ' a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge [or Tribunal] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided ' ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [72] ; VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102 at [25] citing Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425).</text>

<tocase>SZMSS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 93</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/93.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant submits that the Tribunal member had a closed mind or that there was a reasonable apprehension that she did not bring an unprejudiced mind to the review. The particulars and submissions given in support of this ground contained in the appellant's first set of submissions all raise factual matters concerning the appellant's claims. In his further written submissions, the appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to provide him with a genuine opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing and that it had already formed a firm view before he was questioned about his faith because it was affected by incorrect independent country information. He refers to SZMSS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 93 in support of this submission.

Contrary to the appellant's submission, the Tribunal's reasons at [29] to [33] indicate that the appellant was given the opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing (cf SZMSS at [12]). For example, the appellant recounted his conversion to and practice of Christianity and explained his understanding of the Bible.

The Tribunal asked the appellant why he converted to Christianity and what he told people when he spread the gospel. These questions were largely responsive to the matters raised by the appellant. Other questions asked by the Tribunal concerned the appellant's own practice of Christianity in China and whether he had read or studied anything other than the Bible. Otherwise, the Tribunal asked the appellant a question about each of the second coming and the appellant's view of creation. The appellant answered each question. There is no indication in the Tribunal's reasons that it asked these questions in a manner that suggested pre-judgment or a closed mind (cf SZMSS at [15]). Questions exploring the appellant's knowledge of his claimed faith, on which he relied as a basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, do not of themselves indicate bias or a closed mind or a failure to consider the appellant's claims.

The Tribunal then turned to the appellant's knowledge of the Church he attended in Sydney. It put a number of questions concerning the beliefs and practices of the Church to the appellant and to Mr Ng, known as Brother Wu, who had accompanied the appellant to the hearing. The Tribunal said that it had done some reading about the Church and it appears that such reading may have informed the Tribunal's questions to the appellant and Mr Ng. However, this does not indicate bias or a closed mind.

The ground of appeal based on an allegation of bias or apprehended bias by the Tribunal is not made out. Did the Tribunal fail properly to consider the appellant's claim?</text>

<tocase>SZNLJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 606</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/606.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant is a citizen of China, born in 1978, who arrived in Australia on 6 August 2008. He claimed to fear persecution in China based on his Christian activities and beliefs and his involvement in anti-Three Gorges Dam activities. The appellant applied for a protection visa, which a delegate of the Minister refused to grant. The appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. He was invited to and did attend a hearing on 6 February 2009. The appellant and a witness attended a further hearing on 12 March 2009. The Tribunal made a decision affirming the decision of the delegate. Federal Magistrate Driver dismissed the appellant's application for review of the Tribunal decision ( SZNLJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 606). This is an appeal from his Honour's decision.

Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed that he had suffered persecution in China by reason of his involvement in Christian activities and anti-Three Gorges Dam activities. He claimed to have become a Christian in May 2007 and to have distributed religious materials and the Bible. He claimed to have been involved with protests by peasants who had migrated due to the Three Gorges Dam project. He says that he was arrested, detained, tortured and subjected to physical and mental persecution as part of a process called "education through labour" between 1 November 2007 and 31 December 2007. After this incident, he went into hiding, illegally obtained an Australian visa and fled China. He claimed that he would be arrested if he returned to China because he had taken part in the underground movement of Christians and distributed religious materials and had helped the Three Gorges Dam peasants in their protests. The appellant also claimed that after he arrived in Australia, he attended the Christian Assembly of Sydney church in Lidcombe and a Christian church in Auburn.

In view of the matters raised in the appeal, it is relevant to give some further detail of the basis of the appellant's claims, as recorded by the Tribunal in its decision which, in turn, included the appellant's statement made in support of his application for a protection visa.</text>
