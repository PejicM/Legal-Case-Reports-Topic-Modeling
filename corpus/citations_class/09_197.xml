<tocase>AB v LB (Mental Health Patient) [1980] 1 WLR 116</tocase>
<text>His Honour could see no reason for construing s 494D as preventing the adoption by the Minister of a form of internet application which included provision for the notification of the name of an authorised recipient in the same form. His Honour rejected the submission that s 494D must be read as requiring a written signature from the visa applicant appointing the authorised recipient. He observed that it may often be administratively appropriate for a written and signed notice to be required by the Department, before being satisfied as to a due appointment. However, he could can find nothing in the terms or objects of s 494D which confined the Minister as to the manner in which he was to be satisfied that notice of an authorised recipient has been duly given. Nor could he find in s 494D any intention to exclude the normal presumption that Parliament intends to allow a person to act for the purposes of a statutory provision through an agent (cf. Christie v Permewan, Wright &amp; Co Ltd [1904] HCA 35 ; (1904) 1 CLR 693 at 700, McRae v Coulton (1986) 7 NSWLR 644 at 663, and AB v LB (Mental Health Patient) [1980] 1 WLR 116 at 121, cited in Bennion FAR, Statutory Interpretation &#8212; A Code (2nd ed, Butterworths, 1992), at 799 800).

<tocase>McRae v Coulton (1986) 7 NSWLR 644</tocase>
<text>His Honour could see no reason for construing s 494D as preventing the adoption by the Minister of a form of internet application which included provision for the notification of the name of an authorised recipient in the same form. His Honour rejected the submission that s 494D must be read as requiring a written signature from the visa applicant appointing the authorised recipient. He observed that it may often be administratively appropriate for a written and signed notice to be required by the Department, before being satisfied as to a due appointment. However, he could can find nothing in the terms or objects of s 494D which confined the Minister as to the manner in which he was to be satisfied that notice of an authorised recipient has been duly given. Nor could he find in s 494D any intention to exclude the normal presumption that Parliament intends to allow a person to act for the purposes of a statutory provision through an agent (cf. Christie v Permewan, Wright &amp; Co Ltd [1904] HCA 35 ; (1904) 1 CLR 693 at 700, McRae v Coulton (1986) 7 NSWLR 644 at 663, and AB v LB (Mental Health Patient) [1980] 1 WLR 116 at 121, cited in Bennion FAR, Statutory Interpretation &#8212; A Code (2nd ed, Butterworths, 1992), at 799 800). Considerations of convenience all pointed towards the section being intended to allow this.

There is no requirement in s 494D (or elsewhere) for the notice appointing the authorised recipient to be in any particular form; any notice in writing meeting the elements of subs 494D(1) will suffice. There is no requirement for the notice under subs 494D(1) to be signed at all but even if there was a requirement that it be signed by the appellant, there would still be room for application of the presumption that the appellant could meet that requirement through an agent: McRae at 663D.

In addition, there are a number of factual findings in the way of the appellant succeeding on this ground. His Honour found that the interactive form was completed by someone (unknown) at Tan &amp; Tan with the full authority of the appellant: [17] and [40] of his reasons. His Honour also found that it was not a matter of concern for the appellant to know which person within the firm he dealt with or who within the firm was registered as a migration agent: [19] and [20] of his reasons. His Honour also found that the contract between the appellant and the firm envisaged it making electronic visa applications on his behalf and sending/receiving on his behalf communications with the Department: [22] of his reasons; and finally his Honour's rejection of the appellant's submissions that Mr Yat Tan (a registered migration agent) had not appropriately supervised and taken responsibility for his matter: his Honour's reasons at [27] and [28]. Ground 2
 The learned Federal Magistrate made an error of law in failing to find that after Mr Yat Tan's name was stated in the electronic application lodged at the beginning Mr Yat Tan abandoned his role as migration agent where there was no evidence at all of this role in the furthering of the visa application from any of the records or the appellant's affidavit evidence before the Court. His Honour thus wrongly failed to hold that DIAC was on constructive notice that Mr Yat Tan was not the migration agent or the authorised recipient acting for the appellant.

This ground seeks to re-agitate his Honour's findings under ground 4 below. It is not suggested that his Honour's findings at [48] and [49] of his reasons were not open on the evidence before him. That being so, his Honour's conclusion at [50] his refusal to accept that at any time between the lodging of the visa application with its notice of authorised recipient, and the emailing of the delegate's decision to Mr Yat Tan, there was anything which occurred which could or should have caused the Department of Immigration to doubt that currency of the appointment of the notified authorised recipient should not be disturbed. Ground 3
 The learned Federal Magistrate made an error of law in misconstruing s 280 in relation to the difference between the right of a migration agent and a legal practitioner who is not a migration agent. His Honour erred by (i) referring to legal services in [49] where there was only migration services performed and no legal services performed (ii) failed to understand that there can not be a contract of engagement for migration network between an applicant and an entity as only a person can be a migration agent and an entity can not be licensed as migration agent. This misunderstanding led to his Honour to find that Mr Yat Tan did not fail to perform his duties as a migration agent.

This ground has no foundation. His Honour did not misconstrue s 280 of the Act in the ways contended; rather, the appellant and his legal representatives have totally misconstrued his Honour's reasoning. His Honour showed no error as to his understanding of the role of a registered migration agent. Moreover, on his Honour's findings of fact: 
(a) the authorised recipient in this case, Mr Yat Tan, was a registered migration agent (although there is no requirement in the Act that an 'authorised recipient' must be a registered migration agent);
 
(b) his Honour was not satisfied that Mr Yat Tan 'did not take responsibility under the Migration Act and within the firm of Tan &amp; Tan for [the appellant's] migration work' [27] and [56];
 
(c) nor was his Honour satisfied that Mr Yat Tan was 'in any way derelict in his responsibilities as a registered migration agent under the relevant provisions of the Migration Act , in particular s.280(1) ' [28]; or that he was deficient in his 'supervision and responsibility' [29]. (Emphasis added)

His Honour was not denying the role of a 'registered migration agent'. To the extent that he referred to the agreement between the appellant and the firm, his Honour was doing so only to examine whether the authority given by the appellant to partners and employees of Tan &amp; Tan was wide enough to give the notice of the kind contemplated by subs 494D(1). He was not suggesting that 'the firm', as opposed to Mr Yat Tan, had the responsibilities of a registered migration agent. Ground 4
 The learned Federal Magistrate made an error of law by finding at [63] that he is not satisfied on the evidence before him that Tan &amp; Tan did fail to communicate the delegate's decision speedily, and in the manner that they claim in their correspondence with Mr Jalagam.

This ground also has no foundation. The finding complained of was one of fact, well open to his Honour and no appellable error is shown.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501</tocase>
<text>His Honour observed that the authorities subsequent to SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 , for example, Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501, SZLHP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 170 and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 211, emphasised the need for a careful formulation of allegations of fraud coming within the principles referred to by the High Court, as well as careful attention to the necessary causal relationships between the suggested fraud and the suggested inconsistency with statutory procedures.

Plainly, SZFDE required not only that there be fraud in the sense of dishonesty, but also that there be a causative connection between that and the Tribunal being 'disabled ... from the true discharge of its imperative statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review': SZFDE at [51]; such that its decision was, in law, no decision at all: ( SZLIX at [18]; also [20]). If the appellant would in any event have been out of time, any dishonesty (assuming, contrary to his Honour's finding, that there was some dishonesty by anyone at Tan &amp; Tan) would not have made any difference. There would be no link between the suggested 'fraud' and the Tribunal's decision-making process: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [32] and [34] also speaks of this requirement.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/35.html</AustLII>
<text>His Honour observed that the authorities subsequent to SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 , for example, Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501, SZLHP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 170 and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 211, emphasised the need for a careful formulation of allegations of fraud coming within the principles referred to by the High Court, as well as careful attention to the necessary causal relationships between the suggested fraud and the suggested inconsistency with statutory procedures.

Another difficulty was his Honour's acceptance of the submission of the Minister's counsel, that if he accepted all the evidence led by the appellant, it would support, at most, a conclusion only that there was a failure by Tan &amp; Tan speedily to convey the delegate's decision to the applicant. At most, in his Honour's opinion, the appellant's evidence might support a finding of negligence in communicating with a client of the firm on a significant matter. However, on the above authorities this was not enough (reference was made to SZFDE at [53]).

The appellant filed a notice of appeal on 13 October 2008 raising three grounds but in that notice foreshadowed the filing of an amended notice of appeal when the written reasons for judgment below became available. An amended notice of appeal raising six grounds was filed under cover of a supplementary notice on 23 October 2008. The appellant relies on the six grounds in the amended notice of appeal and the respondent took no objection to that course on the understanding that it was not to be taken as, or seen to be, consent to the appellant reformulating any allegation of fraud. The appellant also read an affidavit sworn 8 December 2008, without objection on the part of the respondent, which had been filed on 11 December 2008 annexing the transcript of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court. Ground 1
 The learned Federal Magistrate erred by misconstruing s 494D of the Act.

This ground seeks to challenge his Honour's findings (under ground 1 below) that s 494D does not require that a signature from the appellant be part of the notice to the Minister envisaged by that section. His Honour's findings in this regard are set out at [40] and [41] of his reasons and summarised in [17] and [18] above.

Plainly, SZFDE required not only that there be fraud in the sense of dishonesty, but also that there be a causative connection between that and the Tribunal being 'disabled ... from the true discharge of its imperative statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review': SZFDE at [51]; such that its decision was, in law, no decision at all: ( SZLIX at [18]; also [20]). If the appellant would in any event have been out of time, any dishonesty (assuming, contrary to his Honour's finding, that there was some dishonesty by anyone at Tan &amp; Tan) would not have made any difference. There would be no link between the suggested 'fraud' and the Tribunal's decision-making process: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [32] and [34] also speaks of this requirement.

That finding was open to his Honour and no appellable error is shown. It attracts what was said in SZFDE at [53] as to there being no jurisdictional error in mere bad or negligent advice or other mishap.

In any event, the appellant has not shown the combination of elements required to make out jurisdictional error of the kind discussed in SZFDE and the other cases to which reference was made.

No appellable error by his Honour or jurisdictional error by the Tribunal is established.

The appeal must be dismissed, with costs.

<tocase>WACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/50.html</AustLII>
<text>Nor was his Honour persuaded that anything in the High Court's decision in WACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 required him to construe s 494D as being confined in the manner of a notification as was submitted.

His Honour therefore agreed with the Tribunal's conclusion that there was an expiry of the time limit on an appeal to the Tribunal, which commenced from the date when Mr Yat Tan received the delegate's decision.

Ground 4 of the further amended application made a similar argument, but by reference to events subsequent to the lodging of the visa application and appointment of Mr Yat Tan as authorised recipient. It contended: 
 The Tribunal made jurisdictional error in that it should have held that the notification of the decision was defective as it was not sent to the correct authorised recipient. DIAC was on constructive notice that Mr. Yat Tan was not the migration agent or the authorised recipient acting for the applicant.

His Honour did not accept that at any time between the lodging of the visa application with its notice of authorised recipient, and the emailing of the delegate's decision to Mr Yat Tan, there was anything which occurred which could or should have caused the Department of Immigration to doubt the currency of the appointment of the notified authorised recipient. His Honour could not find anything in the correspondence which, as a matter of law, deprived that appointment of its effect for the purposes of s 494D.

His Honour, therefore, did not accept this ground, or its arguments, as a basis for finding that the Tribunal had jurisdiction in the matter.

Ground 5 contended: 
 The Tribunal's decision was affected by fraud on the Tribunal, on DIAC and the applicant because Yat Tan was not the migration agent acting for the client and as such in reality was not the authorised recipient but Tat [sic] &amp; Tan and Yat Tan still gave the deceptive and fraudulent impression to DIAC that he was the migration agent for the applicant. In fact the work was carried out by other people under his name for benefit of Tan &amp; Tan. A non-migration agent was not supposed to represent the applicant with the DIAC.

The fraudulent conduct which was alleged was described in the appellant's written submissions: 
 The applicant was misled as to who his migration agent was. The correspondence from Tan &amp; Tan was carried out by people other than Yat Tan who should have acted for the applicant. Communication to the applicant was also carried out by people other than Yat Tan. There appears to be fraudulent effort by staff at Tan &amp; Tan to give the impression that Yat Tan was to be and indeed was the migration agent. [Alt]hough the applicant believed that he was represented by a licensed and qualified migration agent that was not the case in reality.</text>
