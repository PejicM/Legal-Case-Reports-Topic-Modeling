<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The principles governing the grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions have recently been confirmed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457. Chief Justice Gleeson and Crennan J at [19] observed:
 
 ... in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. These are the organising principles, to be applied having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case, under which issues of justice and convenience are addressed. We agree with the explanation of these organising principles in the reasons of Gummow and Hayne JJ, and their reiteration that the doctrine of the court established in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [(1968) [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618] should be folIowed. (footnotes omitted)

25 At [70] Gummow and Hayne JJ make clear that they (like Gleeson CJ and Crennan J) have no objection to the use of the phrase 'serious question' if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question depends on the considerations emphasised in Beecham [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 . At [71] their Honours emphasise that the governing consideration is that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2001/339.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The scope of the definition of a 'managed investment scheme' has been considered in a number of cases. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 46, Barrett J adopted the description and explanation of a 'managed investment scheme and its components' in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [2001] WASC 339 at [45] - [49] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [26]-[32]. Justice Goldberg in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife (2006) 235 ALR 328 agreed with and adopted those descriptions and I would be content to do likewise.</text>

<text>21 The scope of the definition of a 'managed investment scheme' has been considered in a number of cases. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 46, Barrett J adopted the description and explanation of a 'managed investment scheme and its components' in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [2001] WASC 339 at [45] - [49] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [26]-[32]. Justice Goldberg in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife (2006) 235 ALR 328 agreed with and adopted those descriptions and I would be content to do likewise.

26 This application is also brought in reliance of provisions of the Corporations Act , and I am mindful of the need to consider the purpose and objectives of that legislation in the consideration of the relief sought, particularly pursuant to ss 1323 and 1324 of the Corporations Act . I should therefore consider the public interest that would be promoted by the making of certain orders if a proper legal basis existed for such relief: see generally Pegasus 41 ACSR 583-584 at [108]-[110]. I must consider whether it is necessary or desirable to make orders for the purpose of protecting the interests of aggrieved persons where orders are sought prohibiting the transfer of property (see for example s 1323 of the Corporations Act ). However, I must be careful not to go beyond what is necessary in the circumstances of this case in making interlocutory orders, based on the extent of the evidentiary material before me.

27 APM has already been wound up. A liquidator, Mr McCann, has been appointed. As I have said, no relief at this interlocutory stage is sought directly in relation to the alleged Scheme, only in relation to its participants. Ancillary orders are sought, for instance, that the provisional liquidator provide a written report as to certain aspects, including the future disposition, of the Scheme but the making of these orders depends on the appointment of a provisional liquidator to the corporate defendants.

28 My function now is to preserve the status quo and to protect insofar as is necessary the interests I have outlined above. As events have transpired the only issues remaining are:
 
 &#8226; whether the continuation of orders preventing the disposal of property in the name of APM should be made;
 &#8226; whether a provisional liquidator should be appointed to the corporate defendants other than APM;
 &#8226; whether the continuation or imposition of orders preventing the disposal of property or the financial records held by the corporate defendants (other than APM) should be made;
 &#8226; whether orders should be made restraining the operation of the Scheme; and
 &#8226; whether restraining orders should be made against Mr Kyriackou.</text>

<text>33 In Constantinidis v JGL Trading Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 625, Kirby P said at 635:
 
 In Zempilas v J N Taylor Holdings Ltd (No 2) (1990) 55 SASR 103; 3 ACSR 5183 (SC(SA)), King CJ (with the agreement of Cox and Olsson JJ) stressed that: 
 
 
 
 The appointment of a provisional liquidator pending adjudication upon the petition for winding up, is a drastic intrusion into the affairs of the company and is not to be contemplated if other measures would be adequate to preserve the status quo . (emphasis added)</text>

<tocase>Re Bike World (Wholesale) Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ACSR 681</tocase>
<text>34 In Re Bike World (Wholesale) Pty Ltd (1992) 6 ACSR 681 Anderson J said at 684:
 
 ... An appointment is made primarily to preserve the assets and undertaking of the company pending the hearing of the petition. The task of the provisional liquidator is to attempt to maintain the status quo until a final decision can be made, after a full hearing, whether the company should be wound up: Re Carapark Industries Pty Ltd (in liq) [1967] 1 NSWR 337 at 341. Such an appointment is not to be made lightly. It works a major interference in the management of the company . ... (emphasis added)

35 I do not discount the possibility that a provisional liquidator may be appointed if there be some public interest element calling for his or her appointment, but there must be some need for such an appointment at this interlocutory stage.

36 I consider that if other appropriate orders can be made to protect the public interest element contended for by ASIC, which in my view there can be in the current circumstances, then the appointment of a provisional liquidator to the corporate defendants is not warranted.</text>
