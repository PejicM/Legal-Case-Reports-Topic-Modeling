<text>62 The parties were not in dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of the 981 Patent. I was referred to numerous authorities in which these principles have been clearly articulated, including Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 ( 'Welch Perrin' ) at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 ( 'Interlego' ) at 478 (see also Stephen J at first instance at 466); D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 22 IPR 1 at 18-19; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39], 238 [52] and 245-246 [91]-[94]; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 ( 'Pfizer' ) at 52-54 [247]-[250]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 ( 'Kirin-Amgen' ) at 452-457 [27]-[35]; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41 ( 'PhotoCure' ) at 85 [172] and 85-86 [168]-[174]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 ( 'Sachtler' ) at 380-382 [39]-[42]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 ( 'Clorox' ) at 260-262 [13]-[22].

64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case:
 
 (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18].
 (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15].
 (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42].
 (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17].
 (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman.
 (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170].
 (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49].</text>

64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case:
 
 (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18].
 (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15].
 (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42].
 (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17].
 (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman.
 (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170].
 (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49].

146 Ranbaxy argued that the actions that Warner-Lambert had to take after 30 May 1986 to develop and market a single enantiomeric drug showed that the practical difficulties to which it pointed were very real. In particular, Ranbaxy referred to the fact that Warner-Lambert encountered difficulties with racemic atorvastatin lactone in mid 1987; at that point it decided to resolve the racemate into its individual enantiomers; and on 1 February 1989 Warner-Lambert filed a United States patent application directed to the process it had developed for the chiral synthesis of enantiomers of atorvastatin lactone. Assuming that it is appropriate on a question of construction to have regard to these subsequent events, these matters do not affect my conclusion as to the proper construction of the 981 Patent. On the evidence before me, there was a common expectation prior to 30 May 1986 that single enantiomeric drugs could be commercially produced whether by way of resolution or chiral synthesis. The fact that there were numerous single enantiomeric drugs on the market by that stage confirmed this expectation. The possibility that difficulties may be encountered in developing an enantomeric drug for commercial sale does not have the consequence, in my view, that the 981 Patent should be read down so that it only claims racemic mixtures. It must be borne in mind that the patent is concerned with the grant of a monopoly in respect of the claimed compounds for a period of 20 years. There is no reason to doubt that there was a general expectation that means could be found to develop methods of synthesising single enantomeric drugs for commercial sale over that time frame. To my mind, it is unreasonable to suppose that the patent was intended to be confined to racemates simply because difficulties might arise in the near term in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale. In any event, I have grave doubts that subsequent conduct of the kind to which Ranbaxy refers in this argument (as distinct from the surrounding commercial circumstances at 30 May 1986) can properly be used as an extrinsic aid to the proper construction of the 981 Patent: cf FAI Traders Insurance Co Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VLR 437; see also Kirin-Amgen at 452 [28].</text>

<text>62 The parties were not in dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of the 981 Patent. I was referred to numerous authorities in which these principles have been clearly articulated, including Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 ( 'Welch Perrin' ) at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 ( 'Interlego' ) at 478 (see also Stephen J at first instance at 466); D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 22 IPR 1 at 18-19; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39], 238 [52] and 245-246 [91]-[94]; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 ( 'Pfizer' ) at 52-54 [247]-[250]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 ( 'Kirin-Amgen' ) at 452-457 [27]-[35]; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41 ( 'PhotoCure' ) at 85 [172] and 85-86 [168]-[174]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 ( 'Sachtler' ) at 380-382 [39]-[42]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 ( 'Clorox' ) at 260-262 [13]-[22].

64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case:
 
 (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18].
 (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15].
 (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42].
 (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17].
 (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman.
 (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170].
 (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49].

70 In PhotoCure at 52 [31], Merkel J said: 
 
 'The common general knowledge will encompass not only information that is retained in the memory of the skilled person, but also information that the person knows of, and to which he or she might refer as a matter of course, or habitually consult: see ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc (1999) 45 IPR 577 at [112] and Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2000) 51 IPR 375; [2000] FCA 1303 at [73] . However, common general knowledge does not include information merely because it would have been able to be found if a routine literature search was conducted: see Alphapharm (HCA) at [31], [44]-[45] and [55]. Nor does it follow from the fact that a publication "may have been held in a library readily accessible to a particular formulator" that such a publication formed part of the common general knowledge: see Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 593; [1999] FCA 628 at [105] ... per Lehane J.'</text>

65 As patent specifications and claims must be construed in light of the common general knowledge of a person skilled in the art before the priority date, it is necessary to ask: who is the skilled addressee? Various descriptions have been given to the skilled addressee, including the 'notional skilled addressee', the 'uninventive skilled worker in the particular field', the 'non-inventive worker in the field', the 'person skilled in the art', the 'non-inventive hypothetical skilled addressee', and 'those likely to have a particular interest in the subject matter of the invention': Root Quality at 241 [70]-[71] per Finkelstein J. The person skilled in the art is a 'relative expression which does not identify any specific person' and may consist of a team of persons with combined skills: Root Quality at 242 [71]; see also The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company v The Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company Limited [1972] RPC 457 ( 'General Tire' ) at 485.

71 In Root Quality at 241-242 [71], Finkelstein J observed that, generally speaking, the skilled addressee is the person who works in the art or science with which the invention is connected. He or she is a person, or team, likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of the invention: at 241-242 [71].</text>

69 There is, accordingly, an important distinction between common general knowledge and public knowledge. In General Tire at 482, the Court of Appeal illustrated the distinction by saying that each and every patent specification of the last 50 years would form part of relevant public knowledge if it is resting anywhere in the shelves of the patent office, whereas common general knowledge is a different concept derived from a commonsense approach to the practical question of what would in fact be known to an appropriately skilled addressee the sort of person good at his or her job that could be found in real life. The Court then observed at 482 that: 
 
 '... individual patent specifications and their contents do not normally form part of the relevant common general knowledge, though there may be specifications which are so well known amongst those versed in the art that upon evidence of that state of affairs they form part of such knowledge, and also there may occasionally be particular industries (such as that of colour photography) in which the evidence may show that all specifications form part of the relevant knowledge.' 


The Full Federal Court referred to this distinction, with approval, in W R Grace &amp; Co v Asahi Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha (1993) 25 IPR 481 at 492; see also Heerey J at first instance: Asahi Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v W R Grace &amp; Co (1991) 22 IPR 491 at 523.</text>

<text>66 In NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne (2006) 69 IPR 542 ( 'NSI Dental' ) Tamberlin J said at 570 [151]:
 
 'At the outset, it is necessary to describe the attributes of the skilled addressee and the relevant patent area. The skilled addressee is a legal construct and is assumed to be a person, or team, who is "not 'particularly imaginative or inventive'": Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [288] per French and Lindgren JJ.

<text>66 In NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne (2006) 69 IPR 542 ( 'NSI Dental' ) Tamberlin J said at 570 [151]:
 
 'At the outset, it is necessary to describe the attributes of the skilled addressee and the relevant patent area. The skilled addressee is a legal construct and is assumed to be a person, or team, who is "not 'particularly imaginative or inventive'": Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [288] per French and Lindgren JJ. This does not mean that the addressee is a technician or person with only practical and non-academic qualifications. In fields such as chemistry, the addressee can be a person or group with high level qualifications and a capacity for original research: Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [30] .'

67 Axiomatically, the identity of the person who is skilled in the art will vary with the nature of the invention and the field with which it is concerned. The level of skill which can properly be attributed to the skilled addressee will be an important determinant of his or her common general knowledge. The qualifications of the skilled addressee, the setting in which and the resources with which he or she operates, and the practices and techniques that he or she regards as commonplace and known will also be important considerations: see Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 ( 'Alphapharm' ) at 465 [153] per Kirby J.

68 In Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Aust) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 ( 'Minnesota' ) at 292, Aickin J described 'common general knowledge' as: 
 
 '... that which is known or used by those in the relevant trade. It forms the background knowledge and experience which is available to all in the trade in considering the making of new products, or the making of improvements in old, and it must be treated as being used by an individual as a general body of knowledge.' 


Aickin J went on to add that those working or studying in some fields of endeavour may make themselves familiar with all patent specifications as they become available for inspection, in one or in many countries, so that their contents become common general knowledge in that particular trade or field of manufacture in the country in question. But that is not so in all fields or in all countries. There must be evidence that the content of a patent specification has become part of the common general knowledge of those working in the relevant field before it can be regarded as part of the background knowledge and experience of the skilled addressee: at 294-295. The High Court confirmed this analysis in Alphapharm at 426-427 [31], 430-431 [44]-[45] and 434 [55].</text>

<text>69 There is, accordingly, an important distinction between common general knowledge and public knowledge. In General Tire at 482, the Court of Appeal illustrated the distinction by saying that each and every patent specification of the last 50 years would form part of relevant public knowledge if it is resting anywhere in the shelves of the patent office, whereas common general knowledge is a different concept derived from a commonsense approach to the practical question of what would in fact be known to an appropriately skilled addressee the sort of person good at his or her job that could be found in real life. The Court then observed at 482 that: 
 
 '... individual patent specifications and their contents do not normally form part of the relevant common general knowledge, though there may be specifications which are so well known amongst those versed in the art that upon evidence of that state of affairs they form part of such knowledge, and also there may occasionally be particular industries (such as that of colour photography) in which the evidence may show that all specifications form part of the relevant knowledge.'

<text>72 In an international field such as drug discovery and development, the Court may have regard to evidence given by experts from outside Australia in assessing the state of common general knowledge of a skilled addressee or a skilled team working in Australia at the priority date: Pfizer at 63 [293]-[295]. Evidence from such witnesses may support the inference of a global pool of common general knowledge on issues relevant to the invention which would have been known to the skilled addressee in Australia: at 63 [294]; see also NutraSweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co Inc (2005) 67 IPR 381 at 387-388 [29]-[32] per Finkelstein J.

73 Both Warner-Lambert and Ranbaxy called evidence from expert witnesses as to the identity of the skilled addressee in the relevant field, and as to the matters that would fall within the common general knowledge of the skilled addressee immediately before the priority dates of the 981 Patent (30 May 1986) and the Enantiomer Patent (21 July 1989). Neither party, nor any witness, suggested that the nature of the relevant field, or the identity of the skilled addressee, differed between May 1986 and July 1989.

74 Professor Christopher Easton gave evidence on behalf of Warner-Lambert. He is a professor at the Research School of Chemistry, Institute of Advanced Studies, Australian National University. He was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Adelaide in 1981. His PhD involved research in the area of organic chemistry. In 1982, he was a Research Fellow in the Research School of Chemistry at the Australian National University, working on projects relating to organic and biological chemistry including reactions involving the biosynthesis of penicillin. From 1983 to 1986, he was a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. From 1986 to 1988 he was a Lecturer in the Department of Organic Chemistry at the University of Adelaide and on 1 January 1992 he was appointed a Reader in the Department of Organic Chemistry. Since 1995, he has held the positions of a Senior Fellow, Professor and Distinguished Professor at the Research School of Chemistry. From 1988, he has also been involved in numerous research projects in the field of medicinal chemistry and drug research.</text>

<text>22 Pairs of enantiomers have many of the same chemical and physical properties, such as identical melting points and the same solubilities and colours. However, they can be differentiated from one another based on the effect they have on the rotation of polarised light. When polarised light is passed through a solution containing only one enantiomer of a compound, the plane of polarised light is rotated either in a clockwise direction (right, denoted with a '(+)' or ' d- ') or in an anti-clockwise direction (left, denoted with a '(-)' or 
' l- '). Because of their ability to rotate the plane of polarised light, enantiomers are said to be 'optically active'. They are sometimes referred to as 'optical isomers'.

23 To distinguish between different enantiomers of the same compound, chemists assign absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centre according to a naming system, known as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. For the purpose of these reasons for judgment, it is sufficient to say that these priority rules require the atoms attached to the carbon centre to be ranked according to their atomic number: the higher the atomic number, the larger the atom in three-dimensional space, and therefore the higher the priority. It is this ranking which will ultimately determine whether the chiral centre has an 'R' configuration (from the Latin word 'rectus'), which has a clockwise arrangement of atoms from highest to lowest priority, or an 'S' configuration (from the Latin word 'sinister') which signifies an anti-clockwise arrangement of atoms. 
 Figure 3 
 
 
In Figure 3, absolute stereochemistry has been assigned according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, where atom '1' has the highest priority (highest atomic number) and atom '4' the lowest priority (and therefore the lowest atomic number).

24 An enantiomer with absolute stereochemistry or configuration of 'R' will not necessarily rotate polarised light in a clockwise direction. Likewise, an enantiomer with absolute stereochemistry of 'S' will not necessarily rotate polarised light in an anti-clockwise direction. The designation of (+) or (-) must be determined through testing the enantiomer. There is no correlation between the absolute stereochemistry or configuration of an enantiomer and the (+) or (-) designations.

127 The construction of claim 1 and structural formula I that I prefer is supported by my findings as to the common general knowledge that should be attributed to the skilled addressee as at May 1986. Because of the major developments that had been published in the field of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including the Alberts paper, the Stokker I and Stokker II papers, the Willard Patent, and the Kathawala Patent application, it was generally known that the RR enantiomer was very likely to be the active, or more active, enantiomer, and that conversely it was very likely that the S enantiomer would be inactive or substantially less active. It was also generally known that the ring-opened form of the upper lactone portion of the natural compounds had been found to be significantly more active than the lactone form. The 981 Patent itself provides some confirmation of this. The statement in the 981 Patent that the Willard Patent disclosed certain compounds which, in the 4R-trans isomeric form, are inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis forms part of the context in which the claims of the 981 Patent must be construed. The Full Federal Court's decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding and Co Limited [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 ( 'Bristol-Myers' ) at 536 [30] indicates that this statement in the patent specification is to be regarded as an admission by the patentee that it forms part of the common general knowledge existing in the relevant field as at the priority date of the patent.

128 In these circumstances, in the absence of any clear indication or language to the contrary, the skilled addressee as at May 1986 would read claim 1 as encompassing both individual enantiomers, as well as mixtures of them. As Warner-Lambert submitted, it would make no sense to exclude patent protection for the more active enantiomer. The point was well made by Professor Easton in the course of his affidavit evidence when he said that to confine the subject of the 981 Patent to racemic mixtures would exclude the thing (the active or more active enantiomer) that he, and any person working in the field as at May 1986, would know to be the key to the useful activity of the compounds disclosed by the patent.

129 It is not in dispute that structural formula I would be construed by the skilled addressee as including a trans racemate of the compounds of the formula. But there is no reason why the skilled reader would construe the formula as meaning only the trans racemate, thereby excluding both the R-trans and the S-trans enantiomers. In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, it offends common sense to construe structural formula I in that way.

172 On the face of these provisions, it is difficult to discern any substantive difference between s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act on the one hand, and the combined effect of the opening words of s 18(1), the definition of invention in Sch 1, and para (a) of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act on the other hand. This is, however, an issue to which I will need to return in the context of a fuller discussion of the decisions in Advanced Building Systems Pty Limited v Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Limited [1998] HCA 19 ; (1998) 194 CLR 171 ( 'Ramset' ) and Bristol-Myers .

175 For the reasons elaborated below, I do not accept that Ranbaxy's case on 'manner of manufacture' is foreclosed by the High Court's decision in Ramset . In my opinion, Ranbaxy's argument falls squarely within the framework of the High Court's decision in Philips . In Ramset , the High Court did not question the authority of Philips and, as the Full Court of this Court said in Bristol - Myers , nothing in Ramset detracts from the binding effect of Philips in this Court. As to merits of the argument, I have reached the conclusion that Ranbaxy has not established on the facts that the Enantiomer Patent claims 'nothing but ... a new use of an old substance'. Consequently, Ranbaxy has failed to establish that the Enantiomer Patent is invalid, and liable to revocation, on the ground that was recognised and applied in Microcell and Philips . My detailed reasons for this conclusion are also set forth below.

191 More generally, Warner-Lambert submitted that the majority judgment in Ramset draws a distinction between the grounds that can be relied upon for revocation under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act and those that can be relied upon under the introductory words and/or para (a) of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act. It is correct that the majority drew attention to the significant differences in structure between s 100 of the 1952 Act and the provisions of s 138(3)(b), s 18(1) and Sch 1 of the 1990 Act. The majority also observed that Philips was decided upon a construction of the introductory words of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act. It is unclear, however, where these observations go. With great respect, I doubt that it is entirely correct to say, as Black CJ and Lehane J did in Bristol-Myers at 531 [20], that the Court in Ramset distinguished Philips on the basis that there were significant differences between the 1990 Act and its predecessors. While these differences were noted, the majority ultimately did not rely upon them to distinguish Philips . Rather, as I have already observed, the express basis for distinguishing Philips was that it was a case in which the absence of inventiveness appeared on the face of the specification, rather than emerging from prior publications of the kind that might have supported an objection of obviousness or lack of novelty under s 100(1)(e) or (g). It also needs to be borne in mind that the observed differences between the 1952 Act and the 1990 Act would not have constituted a valid or sufficient basis for distinguishing Philips , given that the case attracted the transitional provisions in s 233(4) of the 1990 Act.

200 In the present case, Warner-Lambert did not dispute that the US Patent is incorporated into the specification for the Enantiomer Patent. Ranbaxy's argument therefore does not require me to look beyond the face of the specification. This view is supported by the decisions of the Full Court in Merck at 518-523 [27]-[39] and Bristol-Myers at 536 [30] and Heerey J in Wrigley at 314 [87]-[93].

201 As the US Patent is substantially identical to the 981 Patent I do not need to consider whether the citation of the 981 Patent as prior art would be sufficient for it to be characterised as information that appears on the face of the specification: see Bristol-Myers at 536 [30]; Microcell at 250; cf Ramset at 192-193 [40]. Nor do I need to consider the additional observations made by the majority in Philips (which were unnecessary for the decision) to the effect that s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act would permit the Court to look beyond the face of the specification in determining whether a claimed invention is nothing more than a new use of an old substance, and whether those observations can be reconciled with the reasoning in Ramset . My task is to apply the principles that were enunciated in Microcell , NRDC and Philips to the claims of the Enantiomer Patent.</text>

<tocase>FAI Traders Insurance Co Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VLR 437</tocase>
<text>146 Ranbaxy argued that the actions that Warner-Lambert had to take after 30 May 1986 to develop and market a single enantiomeric drug showed that the practical difficulties to which it pointed were very real. In particular, Ranbaxy referred to the fact that Warner-Lambert encountered difficulties with racemic atorvastatin lactone in mid 1987; at that point it decided to resolve the racemate into its individual enantiomers; and on 1 February 1989 Warner-Lambert filed a United States patent application directed to the process it had developed for the chiral synthesis of enantiomers of atorvastatin lactone. Assuming that it is appropriate on a question of construction to have regard to these subsequent events, these matters do not affect my conclusion as to the proper construction of the 981 Patent. On the evidence before me, there was a common expectation prior to 30 May 1986 that single enantiomeric drugs could be commercially produced whether by way of resolution or chiral synthesis. The fact that there were numerous single enantiomeric drugs on the market by that stage confirmed this expectation. The possibility that difficulties may be encountered in developing an enantomeric drug for commercial sale does not have the consequence, in my view, that the 981 Patent should be read down so that it only claims racemic mixtures. It must be borne in mind that the patent is concerned with the grant of a monopoly in respect of the claimed compounds for a period of 20 years. There is no reason to doubt that there was a general expectation that means could be found to develop methods of synthesising single enantomeric drugs for commercial sale over that time frame. To my mind, it is unreasonable to suppose that the patent was intended to be confined to racemates simply because difficulties might arise in the near term in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale. In any event, I have grave doubts that subsequent conduct of the kind to which Ranbaxy refers in this argument (as distinct from the surrounding commercial circumstances at 30 May 1986) can properly be used as an extrinsic aid to the proper construction of the 981 Patent: cf FAI Traders Insurance Co Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VLR 437; see also Kirin-Amgen at 452 [28].</text>

<tocase>Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited 457 F3d 1284 (2006)</tocase>
<text>157 The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit adopted a similar construction of the US equivalent of the 981 Patent in Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited 457 F3d 1284 (2006). Like the Court of Appeal in England, the Court of Appeals read the passage in the specification which specifically referred to the four possible isomers as meaning that the invention would otherwise encompass all four isomers of the compounds of structural formula I but for the patentee's express disclaimer of the R-cis and S-cis isomers: at 1289.

158 The 1990 Act governs the issue of the infringement of the 981 Patent and the grant of relief.

159 Ranbaxy has acknowledged that the question of infringement of the 981 Patent will be resolved by a determination of the proper scope of claim 1 of the patent. Specifically, Ranbaxy has admitted that the Ranbaxy Product has the active ingredient atorvastatin calcium. Ranbaxy has also conceded that if claim 1 of the 981 Patent encompasses the R-trans enantiomer of the compounds of structural formula I, its proposed importation and sale of the Ranbaxy Product would infringe claims 1 to 4 and 8 to 9 of the 981 Patent.

162 Ranbaxy has admitted that its product, with its active ingredient atorvastatin calcium, falls within the scope of claim 6 of the Enantiomer Patent. Therefore, the only matters in dispute between the parties in relation to the Enantiomer Patent are as to its validity. The validity of patents that are equivalent to the Enantiomer Patent has been litigated in England, the United States and Canada. However, the decisions in these jurisdictions do not shed any light on the invalidity issues that were contested before me: see Ranbaxy UK at [32] and [40]-[41] per Jacob LJ; Ranbaxy UK Limited v Warner-Lambert Company [2005] EWHC 2142, at [62] per Pumfrey J; Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited , supra; Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd 405 FSupp2d 495 (D Del 2005) at 512-513 [22]-[27], 518 [32], 519 [35] and 520-525 [36]-[43]; see also Pfizer Canada Inc v The Minister of Health [2006] FC 1471.</text>

<text>120 Claim 5 of the 981 Patent uses the (+/-) sign so as clearly to indicate that claim 5 was confined to racemic mixtures. That descriptor is not applied to claim 1 or other claims. Arguably, this provides a slight indication that claim 1 was not intended to be limited to racemic mixtures. It also shows that the patentee was aware of particular means by which claims could be limited to a claim to a racemic mixture. This factor is not irrelevant because it is consistent with other indicators that the patent does not exclude the individual enantiomers. However, I am not disposed to attach significant weight to it: see Ranbaxy (UK) Ltd v Warner-Lambert Company [2006] EWCA 876 ( 'Ranbaxy UK' ) at [30] per Jacob LJ; see also the warnings given about the incautious use of the expressio unius maxim of construction in Houssein v Under Secretary, Department of Industrial Relations and Technology (NSW) [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94 and Wentworth v NSW Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 250.

150 In Ranbaxy UK , the Court of Appeal held that Warner-Lambert's European Patent EP (UK) 0247633, on its proper construction, claimed both the individual enantiomers and the racemate of structural formula I of claim 1. In doing so, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of Pumfrey J: [2005] EWHC 2142 (Patents). The patent in suit was relevantly identical to the 981 Patent. Ranbaxy's construction arguments were also very similar to the arguments advanced in this case. The Court rejected all of those arguments.

151 In the leading judgment, Jacob LJ said at [19]:
 
 '... Overshadowing everything is the fact that the skilled reader would know that the R,R-enantiomer was the form which had all or by far the preponderance of the pharmaceutical activity. He would expect the patentee to know that too. And he would know that the patent claim was drafted by someone who knew what its function was to "demarcate the invention" (per Lord Hoffmann in Kirin-Amgen at p.185). There simply is no rational basis for supposing that the patentee would want to exclude the pure enantiomer which he would have known was the substance which really mattered.' 


A little later in his judgment, his Lordship said at [22]:
 
 'Moreover the actual drawing of formula I and of X shows what is, strictly speaking, just the R,R enantiomer (compare drawing A on Annex A with Formula I). It was common ground that in practice chemists are not precise: that a figure showing a particular structure may mean, in context, a racemate. The Judge held that, in the context of the patent, Formula I would have been understood to show the racemate. However, I can think of no rational reason why it should mean only the racemate in the context of this patent. It is a patent whose big idea is not about stereochemistry but about a novel substitution. The only reference to stereochemistry excludes the "cis-form" of the compounds (which would be both cis-enantiomers) but not the trans- form (which would be both trans-enantiomers). And above all the skilled reader would know that the form giving most if not all activity was the R,R form.'

152 Neuberger LJ reasoned along similar lines at [49]: 
 
 'Subject to the point considered in the next paragraph but one, it seems to me clear that the formula in claim 1 must be a reference to the enantiomers as well as the racemic mixture. As the notional addressee of the patent, the relevantly skilled person, would appreciate, it would have been absurd for the patentee to have limited his claim to the racemic mixture. Given that one of its two constituent enantiomers would have been, at best less effective than, or, at worst, ineffective and detrimental to the effectiveness of, the other enantiomer, it would make no practical sense to construe the formula as extending only to the racemic mixture and not to the latter enantiomer. 
 
 In this connection, I should refer to the Judge's finding that the relevantly skilled person would know how to resolve the racemate (i.e. how to isolate the (more) effective enantiomer) and he would know that this would be generally appreciated by those skilled in the art. That may well be of crucial significance. First, in terms of teaching, the patent is thereby not rendered insufficient if it claims the enantiomers, notwithstanding any express teaching as to how to resolve the racemic mixture. Secondly, the finding underlines the commercial unreality, actual and as perceived by the skilled person, of the contention that the claim does not extend to the enantiomers.'

155 Both Warner-Lambert and Ranbaxy accepted that this decision was persuasive authority in this Court. Senior counsel for Ranbaxy sought to distinguish the case on the basis that it was critical to the decision that no explanation or possible reasons had been advanced as to why the patentee would wish to exclude the individual enantiomers from the scope of claim 1 in the specification. In this regard, senior counsel pointed to the question that Pumfrey J posed in [39] of his reasons: 'a proper approach to construction of this claim is to ask why the patentee, who has covered a two-element composition for use in a drug, would wish not to cover one element of that combination which any reader would know was the effective element and which could be isolated using routine techniques'. Pumfrey J then drew a distinction between an omission that was surprising but for which the patentee might have reasons, and on the other hand an omission that is both surprising and would in the eye of the reader immediately deprive the patent of any commercial effect. Senior counsel for Ranbaxy argued that on this point there was an important distinction between the evidence advanced in the English proceedings and the evidence before this Court. He submitted that Ranbaxy had identified a number of possible reasons why the specification and claims had been drafted so as to exclude the individual enantiomers, in particular the fact that Warner-Lambert proposed to go to market with a racemate and may have contemplated practical difficulties in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale. He did not point to any other significant differences in the evidence before the English Court.

156 The suggested distinction between the two cases is illusory. It is clear from the judgment in the Court of Appeal that Ranbaxy argued that there were reasons why the patentee would want to limit the monopoly to the racemate, including the fact that the patentee had done no work with the enantiomer, had no data on it, at the date of the patent many chiral pharmaceuticals were in racemic form, and the perception of a skilled man would be that the SS enantiomer had little or no effect: at [18] and [19]. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal's decision strongly supports the construction which I have adopted of the 981 Patent.

162 Ranbaxy has admitted that its product, with its active ingredient atorvastatin calcium, falls within the scope of claim 6 of the Enantiomer Patent. Therefore, the only matters in dispute between the parties in relation to the Enantiomer Patent are as to its validity. The validity of patents that are equivalent to the Enantiomer Patent has been litigated in England, the United States and Canada. However, the decisions in these jurisdictions do not shed any light on the invalidity issues that were contested before me: see Ranbaxy UK at [32] and [40]-[41] per Jacob LJ; Ranbaxy UK Limited v Warner-Lambert Company [2005] EWHC 2142, at [62] per Pumfrey J; Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited , supra; Pfizer Inc v Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd 405 FSupp2d 495 (D Del 2005) at 512-513 [22]-[27], 518 [32], 519 [35] and 520-525 [36]-[43]; see also Pfizer Canada Inc v The Minister of Health [2006] FC 1471.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1958] HCA 58 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1958/58.html</AustLII>
<text>167 In advancing this argument, Ranbaxy did not go beyond matters which were apparent on the face of the complete specification for the Enantiomer Patent. The specification specifically refers to and incorporates the US Patent. It also refers to the 981 Patent as relevant prior art. In this sense, Ranbaxy based its argument squarely on the ground of invalidity that was recognised in Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1958] HCA 58 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232 ( 'Microcell' ) and NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655 ( 'Philips' ).

175 For the reasons elaborated below, I do not accept that Ranbaxy's case on 'manner of manufacture' is foreclosed by the High Court's decision in Ramset . In my opinion, Ranbaxy's argument falls squarely within the framework of the High Court's decision in Philips . In Ramset , the High Court did not question the authority of Philips and, as the Full Court of this Court said in Bristol - Myers , nothing in Ramset detracts from the binding effect of Philips in this Court. As to merits of the argument, I have reached the conclusion that Ranbaxy has not established on the facts that the Enantiomer Patent claims 'nothing but ... a new use of an old substance'. Consequently, Ranbaxy has failed to establish that the Enantiomer Patent is invalid, and liable to revocation, on the ground that was recognised and applied in Microcell and Philips . My detailed reasons for this conclusion are also set forth below.

181 In the course of their reasons, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ discussed and approved the earlier High Court decisions in Microcell and National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents [1959] HCA 67 ; (1959) 102 CLR 252 ( 'NRDC' ). There is no doubt that their Honours considered that Microcell (a decision under the Patents Act 1903 (Cth)) and NRDC (a decision under the 1952 Act) applied with equal force to s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act and to the threshold requirement of 'invention' in s 18(1) of the 1990 Act.

187 Warner-Lambert relied on several passages in the majority judgment in Ramset for its contention that Ranbaxy's manner of manufacture argument was legally unavailable. Its contention that the doctrinal content of s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act did not extend to the manner of manufacture argument recognised and applied by the High Court in Microcell was based on the following passage at 190 [33] and [34]: 
 
 'In particular, s 100(2) assumes that issues of obviousness and lack of novelty are extracted by pars (e) and (g) of s 100(1) from what otherwise may have been their inclusion (by means of par (d)) in the general concept of invention within the ambit of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. Novelty and obviousness are dealt with specifically and exhaustively in pars (e) and (g). There remains no scope for the doctrine of secret use, as a qualification to obviousness and novelty, in par (d), and in s 100(2), no occasion to refer to par (d). 
 
 What then was left to provide the doctrinal content of par (d)? Section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies excluded any manner of new manufacture which was "contrary to the Law" or "generally inconvenient". The classification of certain methods of treatment of the human body as an inappropriate subject for grants under the Act appears to rest on this footing. Further, it has long been established that "a clear distinction will be drawn between the discovery of one of nature's laws, and of its application to some new and useful purpose". Whilst discovery adds to the sum of human knowledge, s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies is concerned with a manner of new manufacture. Thus, in Neilson v Minister of Public Works (NSW) , Isaacs J, speaking of a discovery which might be applied in the improved treatment of sewage, said: 
 
 
 "Assuming, therefore, the idea is original that the best conditions are fermentation short of putrefaction, still without some practical means of carrying out that idea so as to add to the sum of human art -- not merely human discovery -- the idea is not patentable." 
 
 
 On the other hand, "manufacture" in s 6 is not restricted to vendible processes or their products and may include agricultural and horticultural processes involving the selective use of herbicides.' 


In my opinion, this passage does not go so far as to support Warner-Lambert's contention, and ultimately it is inconclusive.

188 The proposition that novelty and obviousness are dealt with specifically and exhaustively in s 100(1)(e) and (g), and not in s 100(1)(d), does not deny Ranbaxy's proposition that the ground of invalidity discussed in Microcell , NRDC and Philips falls squarely within s 100(1)(d) and s 18(1). The remainder of the passage poses, but does not definitively answer, the question of what is left to provide the doctrinal content of s 100(1)(d). Some examples are given, but they do not address the question whether the ground of invalidity recognised in Microcell , NRDC and Philips would fall within s 100(1)(d). So far as it goes, the distinction that is drawn between discovery and any manner of new manufacture tends to suggest that, if revocation were sought, cases like Microcell and NRDC would fall for consideration under s 100(1)(d). Earlier in their reasons at 183 [15], the majority in Ramset said that the right question when applying the definition of invention and the expression 'any manner of new manufacture' under the 1952 Act is: 
 
 '"Is this a proper subject of letters patent according to the principles which have been developed for the application of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies?"' 


The majority's endorsement of this test also tends to suggest that cases like Microcell and NRDC would have fallen within s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act, had revocation been sought on that ground.

192 In the present case, Ranbaxy based its argument on Microcell and Philips . The majority decision in Ramset does not cast any doubt on the soundness of Microcell . It also expressly approved the High Court's decision in NRDC , which in turn endorsed the principles discussed in Mircocell .

193 Microcell concerned an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Patents to refuse to accept a patent application in the exercise of powers conferred by s 46 of the Patents Act 1903 . The High Court considered that, if it appeared manifest that a valid patent could not be granted, the Commissioner had not merely the power but the duty to reject the application pursuant to s 46. The alleged invention concerned the use of synthetic resinous plastics reinforced with mineral fibres in the manufacture of self-propelled rocket projectors. The Court rejected an argument that the specification need do no more than claim an alleged invention. The Court concluded that a claim for the use of a known material in the manufacture of known articles for the purpose of which its known properties make that material suitable cannot be subject matter for a patent. It is not a claim for an invention as defined in the Act. The position cannot be affected by the fact that nobody had thought of doing the thing before or by the fact that it was found to be a good thing to do: at 246-247, 249, 250-251.

194 The question in NRDC was whether the claimed process fell within the category of inventions to which, by definition, the application of the 1952 Act was confined. In applying the definition of invention in s 6 of the 1952 Act, Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ said that the correct approach is not to ask whether the claim is for a manner or kind of manufacture, but to ask whether it is a proper subject of letters patent according to the principles which have been developed in the application of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies.

195 In NRDC , Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ said at 261-262: 
 
 'The principles which govern the power to refuse a patent have been discussed recently in the case of Commissioner of Patents v. Microcell Ltd . It is shown in that case that in the portion of the definition of invention which includes in the meaning of the word an alleged invention, the word "alleged" goes only to the epithet "new" in the expression "a manner of new manufacture", and that accordingly the Commissioner may properly reject a claim for a process which is not within the concept of a "manufacture". But the case cited shows also that even if the process is within the concept the Commissioner is not bound to accept the allegation of the applicant that it is new, if it is apparent on the face of the specification, when properly construed, that the allegation is unfounded: see also Re Johnson's Patent . It is therefore open to the Commissioner in a proper case to direct the deletion of a claim for a process which may be seen from the specification, considered as a whole, to be "outside the whole scope of what is known as invention" because, in the words of Lord Buckmaster, when Solicitor-General, in Re B.A.'s Application it is "nothing but a claim for a new use of an old substance". But, as the Microcell Case emphasizes, it must always be remembered how much is wrapped up in the "nothing but". Lord Buckmaster did not use the words without explanation:-- " ... when once a substance is known," he said, "its methods of production ascertained, its characteristics and its constituents well defined, you cannot patent the use of that for a purpose which was hitherto unknown". And why? Because in the postulated state of knowledge the new purpose is no more than analogous to the purposes for which the utility of the substance is already known, and therefore your suggestion of the new purpose lacks the quality of inventiveness: see per Bowen L.J. in Elias v. Grovesend Tinplate Co . Unless invention is found in some new method of using the material or some new adaptation of it so as to serve the new purpose, no valid patent can be granted: see Moser v. Marsden; Pirrie v. York Street Flax Spinning Co., Ltd. If, however, the new use that is proposed consists in taking advantage of a hitherto unknown or unsuspected property of the material, the situation is not that to which Lord Buckmaster's language refers. In that case there may be invention in the suggestion that the substance may be used to serve the new purpose; and then, provided that a practical method of so using it is disclosed and that the process comes within the concept of patent law ultimately traceable to the use in the Statute of Monopolies of the words "manner of manufacture," all the elements of a patentable invention are present: see the Microcell Case. It is not necessary that in addition the proposed method should itself be novel or involve any inventive step: Hickton's Patent Syndicate v. Patents and Machine Improvements Co. Ltd. '

196 The majority in Ramset agreed that NRDC sets out the correct way of approaching the definition of invention in the 1952 Act. As s 100(1)(d) provides for revocation where the claimed invention is not an invention within the meaning of the Act, there is no reason to suppose that the application of s 100(1)(d) should be approached in any different fashion from that explained in Microcell and NRDC .

197 The holding and the rationale of Philips were recently applied in Merck &amp; Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2006] FCAFC 91 ; (2006) 68 IPR 511 ( 'Merck' ). At 529 [63], the Full Court (comprising Heerey, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) said that Microcell , NRDC and Philips established the following propositions:
 
 '1. The opening words of s 18(1) ("a patentable invention is an invention that") impose a threshold requirement that the "patentable invention" be an "invention", that is to say an "alleged" "manner of new manufacture" within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies ( Philips at CLR 663; ALR 121; IPR 453). 
 
 2. That requirement will not be met if, on the face of the specification, the subject matter: 
 (a) lacks the necessary quality of inventiveness under the Statute of Monopolies ( Phillips at CLR 664; ALR 122; IPR 454) 
 (b) is not new ( NRDC at CLR 262, ALR 115; IPR 65, Philips at CLR 664; ALR 122; IPR 454) 
 
 3. A new use of an old substance is not an invention if its known properties make it suitable for that use in such a case the new purpose is "no more than analogous to the purposes for which the utility of the substance is already known" ( NRDC at CLR 262; ALR 115; IPR 65) 
 
 4. But there will be an invention if the new use consists in taking advantage of a hitherto unknown or unsuspected property of the substance ( NRDC at CLR 262; ALR 115; IPR 65).' 


Subject to one matter, I consider these propositions are equally applicable to s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act. The qualification is that I am not sure what is meant by proposition 2(b) or that it adds anything to proposition 2(a).

198 In Wm Wrigley Jr Company v Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 298 ( 'Wrigley' ) at 314-315 [87]-[93], Heerey J held that a manner of manufacture argument could be advanced under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act so long as the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification. His Honour expressly stated that this was the effect of the decision in Ramset . Furthermore, his Honour considered that the question whether or not the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification was to be determined by considering and applying the principles discussed in Microcell .

201 As the US Patent is substantially identical to the 981 Patent I do not need to consider whether the citation of the 981 Patent as prior art would be sufficient for it to be characterised as information that appears on the face of the specification: see Bristol-Myers at 536 [30]; Microcell at 250; cf Ramset at 192-193 [40]. Nor do I need to consider the additional observations made by the majority in Philips (which were unnecessary for the decision) to the effect that s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act would permit the Court to look beyond the face of the specification in determining whether a claimed invention is nothing more than a new use of an old substance, and whether those observations can be reconciled with the reasoning in Ramset . My task is to apply the principles that were enunciated in Microcell , NRDC and Philips to the claims of the Enantiomer Patent.

203 It therefore cannot be said, at least not strictly, that the Enantiomer Patent claims 'nothing but a claim for a new use of an old substance'. In Microcell and NRDC , the High Court stressed that a lot is wrapped up in the expression 'nothing but': it contemplates a case where the substance is known, its methods of production ascertained, and its characteristics and constituents are well defined: NRDC at 261-262; Microcell at 249-251. Here, the question is whether the Enantiomer Patent claims a different class of compounds having characteristics and constituents that were identified by the US Patent and the 981 Patent; or whether it is nothing but a claim for a known compound with known properties. No question arises of the kind that was considered in NRDC : the compounds of the Enantiomer Patent are not being applied to a new use that takes advantage of hitherto unknown or unsuspected properties. Like the compounds of the 981 Patent, the compounds of the Enantiomer Patent are to be applied to the inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol.

204 Ranbaxy attempts to meet these points by arguing that entirely routine steps, including the resolution of a racemate into its enantiomers and the selection of a preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salt, can be employed to narrow the class of compounds from those claimed in the 981 Patent to those claimed in the Enantiomer Patent. There are numerous difficulties with this argument, both at the level of principle and when one turns to the evidence.

205 In my view, Ranbaxy's argument requires an extension of the principles that the High Court applied in Microcell , NRDC , Philips and Ramset . Ranbaxy did not accept that this was so. It contended that racemic atorvastatin lactone was a known compound with known properties that were reported in Table 1 (compound 1) of the 981 Patent specification, and that the activity of this racemate is, and was, known to be due to the RR enantiomer. In closing submissions, however, senior counsel for Ranbaxy could not identify any case on 'manner of manufacture' that deals with a situation that is analogous to the present case where a selection process forms the basis of the compounds claimed by the later patent.</text>

<text>169 In these circumstances, the transitional provisions in s 234 of the 1990 Act apply. Section 234(2) and (5) provide: 
 
 '(2) Where, before the commencing day: 
 (a) a patent application had been lodged under the 1952 Act; and 
 (b) a complete specification, or a petty patent specification, had been lodged under that Act in respect of the application; and 
 (c) the application had not been withdrawn or finally dealt with; 
 then, subject to this Chapter and the regulations, this Act applies on and after that day: 
 (d) in relation to the application as if it were a complete application made under this Act; and 
 (e) in relation to the petty patent specification as if it were a complete specification filed under this Act in respect of the application. 
 ... 
 
 (5) Objection cannot be taken to: 
 (a) an application mentioned in subsection (2); or 
 (b) a patent granted on such an application; 
 and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the application or patent, as the case may be, under the 1952 Act.' 


The effect of these provisions is that the Enantiomer Patent can only be revoked under the 1990 Act on a ground of invalidity that would also have been available under the 1952 Act. Where the relevant ground of invalidity under the 1952 Act is narrower than the corresponding ground under the 1990 Act, the patentee has the benefit of the narrower ground. Thus, an applicant for a patent under the 1952 Act is not to be worse off than if the 1952 Act had continued to operate: NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 253-254 per Lockhart J; and ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v The Lubrizol Corporation Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at 224 [23] per Lee, Heerey and Lehane JJ.

176 In Philips , the patent in question was granted under the 1952 Act. However, the proceedings were commenced on 5 July 1991, after the commencement of the 1990 Act, and sought revocation of the patent under s 138 of the 1990 Act. In those circumstances, s 233 of the 1990 Act operated in much the same way as s 234 operates in the present case. Section 233(1) provides that the 1990 Act applies to a standard patent granted under the 1952 Act as if the patent had been granted under the 1990 Act. Section 233(4) provides that objection cannot be taken to such a patent, and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the patent under the 1952 Act. As Lockhart J explained in the Full Court, this meant that the elements of each ground of revocation under the 1990 Act applied only to the extent that they replicated in substance the elements that previously constituted a ground of revocation under the 1952 Act: (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 253-254 per Lockhart J, and also at 268 per Burchett J.

177 Another similarity between Philips and the present case is that the respondent, Mirabella, abandoned the ground of obviousness but persisted with the argument that the subject of the patent was not an invention amounting to a manner of manufacture within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. At trial, Hill J held that the 1990 Act required that the subject matter of a patent be an invention as defined by that Act, that is to say it must be a manner of new manufacture within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies, and that this requirement did not differ in substance from that pertaining under the 1952 Act. His Honour found that the invention lacked inventiveness on the basis that it was no more than a use of a selection of known phosphors, in known compact fluorescent globes, being a purpose for which the known properties of the phosphors indicated suitability. All of this information was apparent on the face of the specification. Accordingly, the trial judge made an order revoking the patent under s 138(3)(b) of the 1990 Act.

178 The Full Federal Court reached the same conclusion. Lockhart J (with whom Northrop J agreed) said that the combination of s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act and Sch 1 thereto continued in force the notion of 'manner of new manufacture' present in s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act: at 263. His Honour also said at 263 that the requirement that a patentable invention be a manner of new manufacture is inherently distinct from the requirements of novelty, lack of obviousness, involving an inventive step and utility as required by s 18 of the 1990 Act. Although Burchett J reached a different conclusion on the facts, he also considered that the language of s 18, read in the light of the definition of invention, imposes a threshold test of patentability by reference to the expression 'manner of new manufacture'. The test requires that the subject matter of the patent must not fall outside the whole scope of what is known as an invention: at 269-270.

179 A majority of the High Court affirmed the Full Court's decision. In their joint majority judgment, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ said at 663-664:
 
 'The effect of those opening words of s 18(1) is that the primary or threshold requirement of a "patentable invention" is that it be an "invention". Read in the context of s 18(1) as a whole and the definition of "invention" in the Dictionary in Sch 1, that clearly means "an alleged invention", that is to say, an "alleged" "manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies". In the light of what has been said above about what is involved in an alleged manner of new manufacture, that threshold requirement of "an alleged invention" will, notwithstanding an assertion of "newness", remain unsatisfied if it is apparent on the face of the relevant specification that the subject matter of the claim is, by reason of absence of the necessary quality of inventiveness, not a manner of new manufacture for the purposes of the Statute of Monopolies. That does not mean that the threshold requirement of "an alleged invention" corresponds with or renders otiose the more specific requirements of novelty and inventive step (when compared with the prior art base) contained in s 18(1)(b). It simply means that, if it is apparent on the face of the specification that the quality of inventiveness necessary for there to be a proper subject of letters patent under the Statute of Monopolies is absent, one need go no further.' 


In reaching this conclusion, their Honours expressly rejected Philips' argument that s 18(1)(b) was exclusive and exhaustive insofar as inventiveness is concerned and that, as a result, there was no scope to raise an argument under s 18(1)(a) or any other part of s 18(1) that the subject matter of the claim as identified in the specification lacks the quality of inventiveness required by s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. More particularly, they rejected Philips' argument that, aside from s 18(1)(b), there was no scope to argue that a claimed use is 'nothing but ... a new use of an old substance' so that it falls outside the whole scope of what is known as an invention: at 663.

180 Although it was strictly unnecessary for their decision, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ also said that they would reach the same conclusion under s 18(1)(a). In their view, the preferable construction of s 18(1)(a) is that the phrase 'manner of manufacture' within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies should be understood as referring to a process which is a proper subject matter of letters patent according to traditional principle: at 667. The Court endorsed the factual conclusion reached by the trial judge and the Full Court that the relevant process was no more than a new use of a particular known product. It therefore followed that the claimed invention was not a manner of manufacture for the purposes of s 18(1)(a) and consequently not a 'patentable invention': at 668.

369 These provisions are directed to the question whether the invention enables the addressee to attain the result promised by the patentee in the patent specification: see Rehm Pty Ltd v Webster's Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1981) 81 ALR 79 ( 'Rehm' ) at 96; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 267 per Lockhart J; Old Digger Pty Ltd v Azuko Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 676 ( 'Old Digger' ) at [216]; Wrigley at [134]-[141]. Want of utility in this sense is different from want of utility in the broader commercial sense that the invention is useless for any purpose whatsoever: see Alsop's Patent (1907) 24 RPC 733 at 752; and Lane-Fox v Kensington &amp; Knightsbridge Electric Lighting Co Ltd [1892] 3 Ch 424 at 431.</text>

<text>169 In these circumstances, the transitional provisions in s 234 of the 1990 Act apply. Section 234(2) and (5) provide: 
 
 '(2) Where, before the commencing day: 
 (a) a patent application had been lodged under the 1952 Act; and 
 (b) a complete specification, or a petty patent specification, had been lodged under that Act in respect of the application; and 
 (c) the application had not been withdrawn or finally dealt with; 
 then, subject to this Chapter and the regulations, this Act applies on and after that day: 
 (d) in relation to the application as if it were a complete application made under this Act; and 
 (e) in relation to the petty patent specification as if it were a complete specification filed under this Act in respect of the application. 
 ... 
 
 (5) Objection cannot be taken to: 
 (a) an application mentioned in subsection (2); or 
 (b) a patent granted on such an application; 
 and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the application or patent, as the case may be, under the 1952 Act.' 


The effect of these provisions is that the Enantiomer Patent can only be revoked under the 1990 Act on a ground of invalidity that would also have been available under the 1952 Act. Where the relevant ground of invalidity under the 1952 Act is narrower than the corresponding ground under the 1990 Act, the patentee has the benefit of the narrower ground. Thus, an applicant for a patent under the 1952 Act is not to be worse off than if the 1952 Act had continued to operate: NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 253-254 per Lockhart J; and ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v The Lubrizol Corporation Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at 224 [23] per Lee, Heerey and Lehane JJ.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/19.html</AustLII>
<text>172 On the face of these provisions, it is difficult to discern any substantive difference between s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act on the one hand, and the combined effect of the opening words of s 18(1), the definition of invention in Sch 1, and para (a) of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act on the other hand. This is, however, an issue to which I will need to return in the context of a fuller discussion of the decisions in Advanced Building Systems Pty Limited v Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Limited [1998] HCA 19 ; (1998) 194 CLR 171 ( 'Ramset' ) and Bristol-Myers .

173 Warner-Lambert submitted that Ranbaxy's case on 'manner of manufacture' is foreclosed by the High Court's decision in Ramset . It pointed out that Ranbaxy had abandoned the grounds of obviousness and lack of inventive step in s 18(1)(b) of the 1990 Act and in the corresponding provision in s 100(1)(e) of the 1952 Act. Against this background, it argued that Ranbaxy's contention that the Enantiomer Patent claimed nothing but a new use of an old substance, and therefore lacked the quality of inventiveness, ought to be regarded as an argument based on obviousness and the lack of an inventive step. It contended that under the 1952 Act such an argument could only be raised under s 100(1)(e) and not under s 100(1)(d).

174 In advancing this argument, Warner-Lambert appeared to accept that, were it not for the transitional provision in s 234 of the 1990 Act, Ranbaxy's argument could have been advanced under the opening words of s 18(1) or possibly under s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act, in accordance with the High Court's decision in Philips . However, Warner-Lambert submitted that there is a distinction between revocation under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act and revocation under s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act. Relying on Ramset at 190 [34], it submitted that the doctrinal content of s 100(1)(d) is confined to alleged inventions which are 'contrary to law' or 'generally inconvenient', categories which were excluded from the field covered by the expression 'any manner of new manufacture' in s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. In contrast, it said that the reference to 'invention' in the opening words of s 18(1) is not so confined.

175 For the reasons elaborated below, I do not accept that Ranbaxy's case on 'manner of manufacture' is foreclosed by the High Court's decision in Ramset . In my opinion, Ranbaxy's argument falls squarely within the framework of the High Court's decision in Philips . In Ramset , the High Court did not question the authority of Philips and, as the Full Court of this Court said in Bristol - Myers , nothing in Ramset detracts from the binding effect of Philips in this Court. As to merits of the argument, I have reached the conclusion that Ranbaxy has not established on the facts that the Enantiomer Patent claims 'nothing but ... a new use of an old substance'. Consequently, Ranbaxy has failed to establish that the Enantiomer Patent is invalid, and liable to revocation, on the ground that was recognised and applied in Microcell and Philips . My detailed reasons for this conclusion are also set forth below.

182 The High Court's decision, like that of the Full Court and Hill J, did not depend solely upon a construction of s 18 of the 1990 Act. As the patent in suit in Philips was granted under the 1952 Act, the decision also depended, critically, on a finding that the manner of manufacture ground of invalidity under s 18(1) would also have been available under the 1952 Act. The majority judgment makes it clear, in my view, that the Court considered that the manner of manufacture ground was fully available under the 1952 Act and that s 18(1) had not altered that position. There are several relevant passages. Immediately following the key passage that I have extracted from their judgment, Brennan CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ said that the position under s 18(1) of the 1990 Act remains that indicated in NRDC , namely that under the 1952 Act the Commissioner could reject an application if it was apparent on the face of the specification that the alleged invention fell outside the scope of what is known as an invention: at 663-664. Later in their reasons, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ said at 665:
 
 'More important, it seems to us to be highly unlikely that it was the legislative intent that there should be a significant alteration of the law as explained in Microcell by extending the ambit of a patentable invention so as to include what is "nothing more" than "the use of a known material in the manufacture of known articles for the purpose of which its known properties make that material suitable". In that regard, we do not accept the argument on behalf of Philips that Microcell was decided on the question of newness and not on manner of manufacture. It is true that, in Microcell, "counsel for the applicants argued that ... they were required to show no more than that the specification described a manner of manufacture and that it was alleged to be new". But it is clear that the decision of the Court was that "[t]he specification in the present case does not, in our opinion, disclose a patentable invention". Rather, the deliberate retention of the established definition of "invention" in the Dictionary in Sch 1 strongly supports the view that it was the legislative intent that the threshold requirement of "an invention" would continue to exclude from a "patentable invention" any claimed process, method or use which was not, on the face of the specification, a proper subject of letters patent according to traditional principles.' 


Lastly, when Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ turned from the introductory words of s 18(1) to consider the proper construction of s 18(1)(a), they noted that NRDC was decided under the 1952 Act and said that the phrase 'manner of manufacture' in s 18(1)(a) should be construed in accordance with the decision in NRDC and earlier judicial decisions about the content of that phrase as used in the saving clause of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. They expressly endorsed Lockhart J's statement in the Full Court that the combination of s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act and Sch 1 thereto had continued in force the notion of 'manner of new manufacture' present in s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act: see also Burchett J's judgment at 270, 278 and 282; and Kirby J's dissenting judgment in Ramset at 194 [42].

183 The patent in suit in Ramset was granted under the 1952 Act. The proceedings were instituted under the 1952 Act, prior to its repeal on 30 April 1991 by the 1990 Act. Accordingly, the 1990 Act had no application to the litigation.

184 At trial, the grounds of obviousness or lack of inventive step, based upon s 100(1)(e) of the 1952 Act, had been abandoned. Hill J held that none of the prior publications relied upon by the respondent was sufficient to make out a case for revocation under s 100(1)(g) of the 1952 Act on the ground that, on the priority date of the claims, the invention was not novel in Australia.

185 In the High Court, in their joint majority judgment, Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said that the issue was whether the Full Court, in purported reliance upon s 100(1)(d), had strayed into a consideration of issues that would have arisen if the ground of revocation in question had been obviousness (which had been abandoned) or lack of novelty (which the Full Court had put to one side): Ramset at 182 [13]. In the result, the majority held that by going beyond the text of the specification and placing decisive weight upon the prior publications, the Full Court had erred. Prior publications of that kind could not be relied upon in considering the ground of revocation in s 100(1)(d); those matters could only have arisen under other grounds, namely obviousness and lack of novelty, which in the circumstances of the case either did not arise or were to put to one side: at 193 [40].

186 The majority distinguished Philips as a case in which the absence of the quality of inventiveness necessary for there to be a proper subject of letters patent under the Statute of Monopolies was apparent on the face of the specification: at 192-193 [39] and [40].

187 Warner-Lambert relied on several passages in the majority judgment in Ramset for its contention that Ranbaxy's manner of manufacture argument was legally unavailable. Its contention that the doctrinal content of s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act did not extend to the manner of manufacture argument recognised and applied by the High Court in Microcell was based on the following passage at 190 [33] and [34]: 
 
 'In particular, s 100(2) assumes that issues of obviousness and lack of novelty are extracted by pars (e) and (g) of s 100(1) from what otherwise may have been their inclusion (by means of par (d)) in the general concept of invention within the ambit of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. Novelty and obviousness are dealt with specifically and exhaustively in pars (e) and (g). There remains no scope for the doctrine of secret use, as a qualification to obviousness and novelty, in par (d), and in s 100(2), no occasion to refer to par (d). 
 
 What then was left to provide the doctrinal content of par (d)? Section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies excluded any manner of new manufacture which was "contrary to the Law" or "generally inconvenient". The classification of certain methods of treatment of the human body as an inappropriate subject for grants under the Act appears to rest on this footing. Further, it has long been established that "a clear distinction will be drawn between the discovery of one of nature's laws, and of its application to some new and useful purpose". Whilst discovery adds to the sum of human knowledge, s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies is concerned with a manner of new manufacture. Thus, in Neilson v Minister of Public Works (NSW) , Isaacs J, speaking of a discovery which might be applied in the improved treatment of sewage, said: 
 
 
 "Assuming, therefore, the idea is original that the best conditions are fermentation short of putrefaction, still without some practical means of carrying out that idea so as to add to the sum of human art -- not merely human discovery -- the idea is not patentable." 
 
 
 On the other hand, "manufacture" in s 6 is not restricted to vendible processes or their products and may include agricultural and horticultural processes involving the selective use of herbicides.' 


In my opinion, this passage does not go so far as to support Warner-Lambert's contention, and ultimately it is inconclusive.

188 The proposition that novelty and obviousness are dealt with specifically and exhaustively in s 100(1)(e) and (g), and not in s 100(1)(d), does not deny Ranbaxy's proposition that the ground of invalidity discussed in Microcell , NRDC and Philips falls squarely within s 100(1)(d) and s 18(1). The remainder of the passage poses, but does not definitively answer, the question of what is left to provide the doctrinal content of s 100(1)(d). Some examples are given, but they do not address the question whether the ground of invalidity recognised in Microcell , NRDC and Philips would fall within s 100(1)(d). So far as it goes, the distinction that is drawn between discovery and any manner of new manufacture tends to suggest that, if revocation were sought, cases like Microcell and NRDC would fall for consideration under s 100(1)(d). Earlier in their reasons at 183 [15], the majority in Ramset said that the right question when applying the definition of invention and the expression 'any manner of new manufacture' under the 1952 Act is: 
 
 '"Is this a proper subject of letters patent according to the principles which have been developed for the application of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies?"' 


The majority's endorsement of this test also tends to suggest that cases like Microcell and NRDC would have fallen within s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act, had revocation been sought on that ground.

189 Warner-Lambert also relied on the following passage from the majority reasons in Ramset at 192 [38]:
 
 'Under that law, as the doctrine with respect to obviousness and lack of inventive step developed in the nineteenth century, it was decided that a claim for "nothing but" a new use of an old substance lacked the quality of inventiveness. There also were instances in which this lack of inventive step was admitted on the face of the specification. If so, a grant might properly be refused in the first instance on the footing that the admission of the lack of an inventive step itself disentitled the applicant to argue that even an alleged invention was disclosed. If such an application had proceeded to grant, the grant would be liable to revocation under s 100(1)(e).' 


Again, I do not think this passage goes so far as to support Warner-Lambert's submission that the argument that a claim lacked the quality of inventiveness because it was for nothing but a new use of an old substance could only be raised under s 100(1)(e), and not under s 100(1)(d), of the 1952 Act. The last sentence of the passage addresses the case where the lack of an inventive step is admitted on the face of the specification; in terms, a case of that kind would fall within para (e). It does not explicitly address the other cases mentioned earlier in the passage, viz, where it appears from the face of the specification that the claim is not for 'a manner of new manufacture', and where the claim is for nothing but a new use of an old substance so that it lacks the quality of inventiveness required by the 1952 Act. The majority do not say that, in cases like those, revocation is only available under s 100(1)(e), or that there can never be any overlap between the grounds in paras (d) and (e) of s 100(1). The possibility that grounds for revocation may overlap in particular cases is well recognised: see Sunbeam Corporation v Morphy-Richards (Aust) Pty Ltd [1961] HCA 39 ; (1961) 180 CLR 98 at 112-113 per Windeyer J; see also Ramset at 189 [31] in the majority judgment, and at 198 [50] and 200 [55] in Kirby J's dissenting judgment.

191 More generally, Warner-Lambert submitted that the majority judgment in Ramset draws a distinction between the grounds that can be relied upon for revocation under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act and those that can be relied upon under the introductory words and/or para (a) of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act. It is correct that the majority drew attention to the significant differences in structure between s 100 of the 1952 Act and the provisions of s 138(3)(b), s 18(1) and Sch 1 of the 1990 Act. The majority also observed that Philips was decided upon a construction of the introductory words of s 18(1) of the 1990 Act. It is unclear, however, where these observations go. With great respect, I doubt that it is entirely correct to say, as Black CJ and Lehane J did in Bristol-Myers at 531 [20], that the Court in Ramset distinguished Philips on the basis that there were significant differences between the 1990 Act and its predecessors. While these differences were noted, the majority ultimately did not rely upon them to distinguish Philips . Rather, as I have already observed, the express basis for distinguishing Philips was that it was a case in which the absence of inventiveness appeared on the face of the specification, rather than emerging from prior publications of the kind that might have supported an objection of obviousness or lack of novelty under s 100(1)(e) or (g). It also needs to be borne in mind that the observed differences between the 1952 Act and the 1990 Act would not have constituted a valid or sufficient basis for distinguishing Philips , given that the case attracted the transitional provisions in s 233(4) of the 1990 Act.

192 In the present case, Ranbaxy based its argument on Microcell and Philips . The majority decision in Ramset does not cast any doubt on the soundness of Microcell . It also expressly approved the High Court's decision in NRDC , which in turn endorsed the principles discussed in Mircocell .

196 The majority in Ramset agreed that NRDC sets out the correct way of approaching the definition of invention in the 1952 Act. As s 100(1)(d) provides for revocation where the claimed invention is not an invention within the meaning of the Act, there is no reason to suppose that the application of s 100(1)(d) should be approached in any different fashion from that explained in Microcell and NRDC .

198 In Wm Wrigley Jr Company v Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 298 ( 'Wrigley' ) at 314-315 [87]-[93], Heerey J held that a manner of manufacture argument could be advanced under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act so long as the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification. His Honour expressly stated that this was the effect of the decision in Ramset . Furthermore, his Honour considered that the question whether or not the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification was to be determined by considering and applying the principles discussed in Microcell .

199 In light of the foregoing authorities, I would sum up the position as follows. There is nothing in the majority judgment in Ramset that casts any doubt on the actual decision in Philips . Ranbaxy's argument on manner of manufacture is not foreclosed by any of the reasoning in Ramset , which does not go nearly as far as Warner-Lambert contends.

201 As the US Patent is substantially identical to the 981 Patent I do not need to consider whether the citation of the 981 Patent as prior art would be sufficient for it to be characterised as information that appears on the face of the specification: see Bristol-Myers at 536 [30]; Microcell at 250; cf Ramset at 192-193 [40]. Nor do I need to consider the additional observations made by the majority in Philips (which were unnecessary for the decision) to the effect that s 18(1)(a) of the 1990 Act would permit the Court to look beyond the face of the specification in determining whether a claimed invention is nothing more than a new use of an old substance, and whether those observations can be reconciled with the reasoning in Ramset . My task is to apply the principles that were enunciated in Microcell , NRDC and Philips to the claims of the Enantiomer Patent.

205 In my view, Ranbaxy's argument requires an extension of the principles that the High Court applied in Microcell , NRDC , Philips and Ramset . Ranbaxy did not accept that this was so. It contended that racemic atorvastatin lactone was a known compound with known properties that were reported in Table 1 (compound 1) of the 981 Patent specification, and that the activity of this racemate is, and was, known to be due to the RR enantiomer. In closing submissions, however, senior counsel for Ranbaxy could not identify any case on 'manner of manufacture' that deals with a situation that is analogous to the present case where a selection process forms the basis of the compounds claimed by the later patent.

206 The decisions in Philips and Ramset do not leave room for the kind of extension that is necessary to accommodate Ranbaxy's argument. My earlier discussion of those cases makes it plain that one of the reasons why the manner of manufacture ground of invalidity has, relevantly, been limited to cases where the lack of inventiveness appears on the face of the specification is to ensure that it does not render otiose the more specific requirements of novelty and inventive step: see Philips at 663-664 and Ramset at 190 [33]-[34] and 192 [38]. Ranbaxy abandoned arguments based on lack of novelty, obviousness and inventive step and it would be inappropriate to allow the manner of manufacture argument to be used as a de facto attack based on obviousness or lack of inventive step. It is also relevant to note that Ranbaxy does not seek to go, and indeed cannot go, behind the claim in the Enantiomer Patent specification that the R-trans enantiomer achieved surprising and unexpected inhibition of the biosynthesis of cholesterol, in the way that it does when pursuing its arguments based on false suggestion and inutility.

207 Later in these reasons, I discuss the authorities on selection patents in the context of the ground of inutility. Those authorities clearly show that a compound selected from a large range of possible compounds can be the subject of a patent, provided special properties are identified through the process of selection.

208 At a factual level, the evidence does not make good Ranbaxy's contention that the gap between the compounds of the 981 Patent and those claimed by the Enantiomer Patent can be dismissed as so routine as to be inconsequential. The expert evidence as a whole establishes that a number of real choices or important selection steps separate the two patents.</text>

There is no doubt that their Honours considered that Microcell (a decision under the Patents Act 1903 (Cth)) and NRDC (a decision under the 1952 Act) applied with equal force to s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act and to the threshold requirement of 'invention' in s 18(1) of the 1990 Act.</text>

<text>189 Warner-Lambert also relied on the following passage from the majority reasons in Ramset at 192 [38]:
 
 'Under that law, as the doctrine with respect to obviousness and lack of inventive step developed in the nineteenth century, it was decided that a claim for "nothing but" a new use of an old substance lacked the quality of inventiveness. There also were instances in which this lack of inventive step was admitted on the face of the specification. If so, a grant might properly be refused in the first instance on the footing that the admission of the lack of an inventive step itself disentitled the applicant to argue that even an alleged invention was disclosed. If such an application had proceeded to grant, the grant would be liable to revocation under s 100(1)(e).' 


Again, I do not think this passage goes so far as to support Warner-Lambert's submission that the argument that a claim lacked the quality of inventiveness because it was for nothing but a new use of an old substance could only be raised under s 100(1)(e), and not under s 100(1)(d), of the 1952 Act. The last sentence of the passage addresses the case where the lack of an inventive step is admitted on the face of the specification; in terms, a case of that kind would fall within para (e). It does not explicitly address the other cases mentioned earlier in the passage, viz, where it appears from the face of the specification that the claim is not for 'a manner of new manufacture', and where the claim is for nothing but a new use of an old substance so that it lacks the quality of inventiveness required by the 1952 Act. The majority do not say that, in cases like those, revocation is only available under s 100(1)(e), or that there can never be any overlap between the grounds in paras (d) and (e) of s 100(1). The possibility that grounds for revocation may overlap in particular cases is well recognised: see Sunbeam Corporation v Morphy-Richards (Aust) Pty Ltd [1961] HCA 39 ; (1961) 180 CLR 98 at 112-113 per Windeyer J; see also Ramset at 189 [31] in the majority judgment, and at 198 [50] and 200 [55] in Kirby J's dissenting judgment.</text>

<text>197 The holding and the rationale of Philips were recently applied in Merck &amp; Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2006] FCAFC 91 ; (2006) 68 IPR 511 ( 'Merck' ). At 529 [63], the Full Court (comprising Heerey, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) said that Microcell , NRDC and Philips established the following propositions:
 
 '1. The opening words of s 18(1) ("a patentable invention is an invention that") impose a threshold requirement that the "patentable invention" be an "invention", that is to say an "alleged" "manner of new manufacture" within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies ( Philips at CLR 663; ALR 121; IPR 453). 
 
 2. That requirement will not be met if, on the face of the specification, the subject matter: 
 (a) lacks the necessary quality of inventiveness under the Statute of Monopolies ( Phillips at CLR 664; ALR 122; IPR 454) 
 (b) is not new ( NRDC at CLR 262, ALR 115; IPR 65, Philips at CLR 664; ALR 122; IPR 454) 
 
 3. A new use of an old substance is not an invention if its known properties make it suitable for that use in such a case the new purpose is "no more than analogous to the purposes for which the utility of the substance is already known" ( NRDC at CLR 262; ALR 115; IPR 65) 
 
 4. But there will be an invention if the new use consists in taking advantage of a hitherto unknown or unsuspected property of the substance ( NRDC at CLR 262; ALR 115; IPR 65).' 


Subject to one matter, I consider these propositions are equally applicable to s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act. The qualification is that I am not sure what is meant by proposition 2(b) or that it adds anything to proposition 2(a).

200 In the present case, Warner-Lambert did not dispute that the US Patent is incorporated into the specification for the Enantiomer Patent. Ranbaxy's argument therefore does not require me to look beyond the face of the specification. This view is supported by the decisions of the Full Court in Merck at 518-523 [27]-[39] and Bristol-Myers at 536 [30] and Heerey J in Wrigley at 314 [87]-[93].</text>

<tocase>Wm Wrigley Jr Company v Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 298</tocase>
<text>198 In Wm Wrigley Jr Company v Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 298 ( 'Wrigley' ) at 314-315 [87]-[93], Heerey J held that a manner of manufacture argument could be advanced under s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act so long as the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification. His Honour expressly stated that this was the effect of the decision in Ramset . Furthermore, his Honour considered that the question whether or not the ground in s 100(1)(d) was established on the face of the specification was to be determined by considering and applying the principles discussed in Microcell .

200 In the present case, Warner-Lambert did not dispute that the US Patent is incorporated into the specification for the Enantiomer Patent. Ranbaxy's argument therefore does not require me to look beyond the face of the specification. This view is supported by the decisions of the Full Court in Merck at 518-523 [27]-[39] and Bristol-Myers at 536 [30] and Heerey J in Wrigley at 314 [87]-[93].

228 These principles were applied by Heerey J in Wrigley where he made the following observation at 321 [125]:
 
 'If a representation was made which was objectively likely to contribute to a decision to grant a patent, and a patent is granted, it may be inferred that the representation in fact contributed to that decision; cf the common law position on inducement in the context of fraud and misrepresentation discussed in Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 219, 236, 250 and 262...'

229 Under the heading, 'Background of the Invention', the patent specification states:
 
 'It is now unexpectedly found that the enantiomer having the R form of the ring-opened acid of trans-5 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (1 methylethyl) N,4 diphenyl 1 [2 tetrahydro 4 hydroxy 6 oxo 2 H pyran 2 yl) ethyl] 1 H pyrrole 3 carboxamide; that is [R (R*,R*)] 2 (4 fluorophenyl) &szlig;, &#948; dihydroxy 5 (1 methylethyl) 3 phenyl 4 [(phenylamino)carbonyl] 1 H pyrrole 1 heptanoic acid, provides surprising inhibition of the biosynthesis of cholesterol.'

230 On the next page, after referring to what was generally known in the field concerning the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the specification states: 
 
 'However, an ordinarily skilled artisan may not predict the unexpected and surprising inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis of the present invention in view of these disclosures.'

369 These provisions are directed to the question whether the invention enables the addressee to attain the result promised by the patentee in the patent specification: see Rehm Pty Ltd v Webster's Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1981) 81 ALR 79 ( 'Rehm' ) at 96; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 267 per Lockhart J; Old Digger Pty Ltd v Azuko Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 676 ( 'Old Digger' ) at [216]; Wrigley at [134]-[141]. Want of utility in this sense is different from want of utility in the broader commercial sense that the invention is useless for any purpose whatsoever: see Alsop's Patent (1907) 24 RPC 733 at 752; and Lane-Fox v Kensington &amp; Knightsbridge Electric Lighting Co Ltd [1892] 3 Ch 424 at 431.</text>

<tocase>Prestige Group (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1990) 19 IPR 275</tocase>
<text>226 This submission correctly identifies the causal connection that is required. It is not necessary to show that 'but for' the suggestion or representation no grant would have been made. In Prestige Group (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1990) 19 IPR 275 (' Prestige '), Lockhart J said at 279-280:
 
 'I agree in substance with the statement in Blanco White [Patents for Inventions, 5th ed] that conduct "calculated substantially to influence the [Commissioner's] decision under the [1952] Act whether or not to grant the patent" is the proper test. I would state the test, however, in different terms, namely, whether the conduct constituting the false suggestion or representation materially contributed to the Commissioner's decision to grant the patent even if other circumstances or causes also played a part in the making of that decision. It is sufficient if the conduct is a material inducing factor which led to the grant. It goes too far to say that the false suggestion or representation must be material in the sense that without it the patent would not have proceeded to grant.'

<text>369 These provisions are directed to the question whether the invention enables the addressee to attain the result promised by the patentee in the patent specification: see Rehm Pty Ltd v Webster's Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1981) 81 ALR 79 ( 'Rehm' ) at 96; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 267 per Lockhart J; Old Digger Pty Ltd v Azuko Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 676 ( 'Old Digger' ) at [216]; Wrigley at [134]-[141].

370 In Rehm , Gummow J explained the governing principles at 96, as follows:
 
 'The basic principle has been formulated as follows in Fawcett v Homan (1896) 13 RPC 398 at 405 per Lindley LJ: "If an invention does what it is intended by the patentee to do, and the end attained is itself useful, the invention is a useful invention." 
 
 What the invention is intended to do is a matter to be gathered from the title and the whole of the specification: Blanco White, Patents For Inventions , SS 4 403. A distinction may be drawn between a case where a patentee claims a result and bases his claim on the production of that result and the case where a patentee merely points to certain advantages that will accrue from the use of his invention: Fox H G, Canadian Patent Law and Practice , 4th ed, pp 152 4.' 


See also TA Blanco White, Patents for Inventions , 5 th edn, Stevens &amp; Sons, London, 1983 ( 'Blanco White' ) at [4-402] and [4-403]; and Terrell on the Law of Patents , 14 th edn, ed D Young et al, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1994 at [5.121]-[5.128].

371 As the latter part of the passage from Rehm suggests, the grounds of utility and false suggestion or misrepresentation can overlap. False suggestion or misrepresentation is a wider concept; it extends to representations that are extraneous to the specification and representations that do not attract the inutility ground. Blanco White states at [4-405]: 
 
 'It is not easy to distinguish between the sort of failure to fulfil a promise of results made in the specification that will amount to lack of utility and the sort that merely amounts to a false representation and accordingly will invalidate only if the patent has been "obtained" upon it. The distinction has been phrased as one between a promise of results and a mere wrong statement of the purposes for which that which is attained can be used; also as one between a promise of results and a "mere puff", or between a false representation of the attributes of the product claimed and an accurate representation as to its attributes coupled with an expression of an "over-sanguine and erroneous view of its character."'

<tocase>IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289</tocase>
<text>375 This construction of the specification is consistent with the character of the Enantiomer Patent. It is, in effect, a selection patent: ie the compounds of the Enantiomer Patent have been selected from the broad class of compounds disclosed by the 981 Patent on the ground that those compounds have unexpected properties. The criteria for the grant of a selection patent were considered in IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 ( 'IG Farbenindustrie' ) at 322-323 and are quite stringent: the selection must be based on some substantial advantage gained or some substantial disadvantage avoided; the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question; and the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character which may fairly be said to be peculiar to the selected group. The authorities also require that the advantages gained, or disadvantages avoided, by the selection must be expressly identified in the body of the specification. Blanco White states at [4-511]:
 
 'Where the patent is a "selection patent," there is an additional requirement for sufficiency that the special advantage obtained from the selection must be stated in the specification. More generally, the advantage resulting from the invention must be stated whenever failure to do so leaves the invention inadequately defined.' 


In IG Farbenindustrie at 323, Maugham J said:
 
 '"I must add a word on the subject of the drafting of the specification of such a patent. It should be obvious, after what I have said as to the essence of the inventive step, that it is necessary for the patentee to define in clear terms the nature of the characteristic which he alleges to be possessed by the selection for which he claims a monopoly. He has in truth disclosed no invention whatever if he merely says that the selected group possesses advantages. Apart altogether from the questions of what is called sufficiency, he must disclose an invention; he fails to do this in the case of a selection for special characteristics, if he does not adequately define them".'

<text>378 Warner-Lambert submitted that Lipitor's commercial success demonstrates that the compounds claimed by the Enantiomer Patent (including claim 6) are undoubtedly useful. It also submitted that Ranbaxy's intention to market its own version of atorvastatin calcium in Australia supports the view that the compound has surprising activity and consequently utility. These submissions are misdirected. Utility in patent law is directed to the results promised by the specification, and not to the broader question of commercial or financial success: see Terrell on the Law of Patents at [5.128]; Badische Anilin Und &amp; Soda Fabrik v Levinstein (1887) 4 RPC 449 at 462.

379 Ranbaxy has succeeded in its challenge to the validity of the Enantiomer Patent. Accordingly, it is entitled to an order revoking the Enantiomer Patent.

380 Warner-Lambert has succeeded in its cross claim that Ranbaxy's intended importation and sale of its product will infringe the 981 Patent. It is entitled to a permanent injunction restraining Ranbaxy during the term of the 981 Patent, and any extension of that term, from infringing the 981 Patent.</text>
