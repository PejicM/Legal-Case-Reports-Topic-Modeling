<tocase>U&amp;I Global Trading (Australia) Pty Ltd v Tasman-Warajay Pty Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 26 </tocase>
<text>1 The applicant is an Australian company. It previously held Australian Petty Patent No AU 200036357 and presently holds Australian Patent No 775427. The subject matter of both patents is a syringe designed so that the needle retracts after use or the mechanism for achieving that result. Both patents were issued pursuant to the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the " Patents Act "). They are largely irrelevant for present purposes. The respondent is an American company which holds American and Australian patents concerning technology designed to achieve the same, or a similar, result. The respondent's relevant Australian patent is described in the further amended statement of claim as Australian Patent No AU-A-59724/98. It seems, however, that it is now Australian Patent No 701878. I am presently concerned only with an application pursuant to s 128 of the Patents Act . For the reasons given by Cooper J in U&amp;I Global Trading (Australia) Pty Ltd v Tasman-Warajay Pty Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 26 at 31-32, a threat, made prior to grant, of infringement proceedings after grant may be a threat for the purposes of s 128. At the hearing it was not suggested that anything turned upon the time at which the respondent's patent was granted. Section 128 provides:
 
 
 '(1) Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, a person aggrieved may apply to a prescribed court, or to another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable; and 
 (b) an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and 
 (c) the recovery of any damages sustained by the applicant as a result of the threats. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the person who made the threats is entitled to, or interested in, the patent or a patent application.'

2 The term 'infringement proceedings' is defined in Sch 1 to mean 'proceedings for infringement of a patent' . The term 'patent' is defined as 'a standard patent or an innovation patent' . Prior to the abolition of petty patents, the definition referred to a 'standard patent or a petty patent' . It is accepted that the threatened infringement proceedings mentioned in s 128 must be threatened infringement of a patent held pursuant to the Patents Act .

3 The applicant asserts that the respondent has threatened infringement proceedings and seeks relief pursuant to s 128. Those alleged threats appear in two letters from Messrs Locke, Liddell &amp; Sapp, American attorneys acting for the respondent, addressed to officers of the applicant. It is necessary that I set out the content of those letters in full. The first is dated 5 October 2004 as follows:
 
 ' Re: Manufacture of Medical Devices Having Retractable Needles 
 Our Ref: 75329.00037 
 
 Dear Mr. Taske: 
 
 We represent Retractable Technologies, Inc. ("RTI") in matters relating to intellectual property and litigation, and are writing this letter on behalf of our client. We have recently learned that your company may be sourcing medical devices having retractable needles through a division or commonly owned or controlled affiliate of Double Dove, a Chinese company with which RTI has had an exclusive manufacturing agreement in effect for more than a year. 
 
 Under the terms of the manufacturing agreement between RTI and Double Dove, Double Dove has expressly agreed not to manufacture any needle product that utilizes automated retraction technology of any type for any entity other than RTI without prior written consent from RTI. RTI has not given any such consent. Furthermore, you should be aware that Double Dove has possession of confidential and trade secret information of RTI, and Double Dove has expressly agreed not to use or disclose any such confidential information or trade secrets except for the benefit of RTI. 
 
 Considering these facts, you can appreciate that RTI is prepared to take any legal action necessary to protect its patented and unpatented technology, its products and its proprietary position with respect to Double Dove and any company with which Double Dove or its affiliates may be dealing. Recently, for example, RTI successfully invalidated Double Dove's own Chinese patent rights for syringes having retractable needles. RTI has also recently achieved other great successes in protecting its intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 
 If our information regarding sourcing of OMI products through entitles related to Double Dove is incorrect, then we regret any unwarranted adverse inference that may be drawn from this letter. On the other hand, if future revelations indicate that Double Dove has violated any aspect of its obligations to RTI by impermissibly assisting others in the manufacture of prohibited devices, RTI intends to pursue all available remedies against both Double Dove and any entity with which Double Dove may be cooperating. 
 
 Please provide us your written assurances at your earliest opportunity that OMI has had no contact with Double Dove or any of its affiliates, and is not sourcing medical devices having retractable needles through any Chinese entity related to any way to Double Dove.'</text>

<tocase>JMVB Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 68 </tocase>
<text>5 At [208]-[211] of her reasons for judgment in JMVB Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 68 at [208]-[211] Crennan J identified various propositions emerging from s 128 as follows:
 
 
 '208. The aggrieved party, ... must first establish the making of a threat ... . The threat must be made in Australia, in that it must be received in Australia and relate to an Australian patent or design: ... . 
 
 209. A threat arises where the language, by direct words or implication, conveys to a reasonable person that the author of the letter intends to bring infringement proceedings against the person said to be threatened ... . A threat may arise without a direct reference to infringement proceedings ... . However, a communication merely notifying a person of the existence of a patent or a patent application, together with a statement that any suggestion that the recipient is entitled to replicate the invention is not maintainable, or a communication seeking confirmation that no improper or wrongful use or infringement of the patent has come to the recipient's attention is not a threat ... . 
 
 210. Once a threat has been established it is prima facie unjustifiable unless the person making the threat establishes that it was justified: ... The court may grant the relief applied for unless the person threatening infringement proceedings establishes that the relevant conduct infringes or would infringe a valid claim of a patent ... . Ultimately, the grant of relief is discretionary ... . 
 
 211. A threat can be made by means of a letter from a legal representative ... .'

6 At the end of these reasons I will deal with the question of whether relief pursuant to s 128 is discretionary in the sense suggested at [210].

7 Pursuant to s 13 of the Patents Act a patent confers upon a patentee the exclusive right to exploit the invention. The term 'exploit' is defined in Sch 1 as follows:
 
 ' exploit , in relation to an invention, includes: 
 
 
 (a) where the invention is a product--make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of the product, offer to make, sell, hire or otherwise dispose of it, use or import it, or keep it for the purpose of doing any of those things; or 
 (b) where the invention is a method or process--use the method or process or do any act mentioned in paragraph (a) in respect of a product resulting from such use.'

39 Again curiously, although his Honour appears to have been referred to the decision in Steinhardt , he seems not to have been referred to the passage concerning discretionary relief to which I have referred. Finally, in JMVB , Crennan J observed at [210]:
 
 'Once a threat has been established it is prima facie unjustifiable unless the person making the threat establishes that it was justified ... . The court may grant the relief applied for unless the person threatening infringement proceedings establishes that the relevant conduct infringes or would infringe a valid claim of a patent ... Ultimately, the grant of relief is discretionary: Townsend Controls at 475.' 
 

Her Honour's decision was pursuant to the Patents Act. I have not been referred to any cases to contrary effect under that legislation. Her Honour seems not to have been referred to the relevant passage in Steinhardt .</text>

<tocase>Earles Utilities Ltd v Harrison (1935) 52 RPC 77 </tocase>
<text>10 The letter of 5 October 2004 addresses a number of subjects without seeking to distinguish clearly between them. Thus, in para 1, the respondent's attorneys indicate that they represent it 'in matters relating to intellectual property and litigation ...' . This reference, by itself, might be understood as indicating the possibility of litigation in defence of intellectual property rights. The term 'intellectual property' is appropriate to describe rights held pursuant to a patent. Thus it might be said that the first sentence itself contemplates the possibility of litigation to protect rights under a patent, the most likely type of litigation being infringement proceedings. However it is important to note that a solicitor who indicates an intention to advise a client to commence infringement proceedings does not threaten for the purposes of s 128. See Earles Utilities Ltd v Harrison (1935) 52 RPC 77 at 80.

11 The writer then asserts that the applicant may be 'sourcing' medical devices having retractable needles from a Chinese company called Double Dove, with which company the respondent claims to have 'an exclusive manufacturing agreement' . Clearly, the matter of concern is the acquisition of retractable needles. The second sentence in para 1 suggests breach of the exclusive manufacturing agreement between the respondent and Double Dove. To this point there has been no assertion of intellectual property or of patents held in connection with retractable needle technology.

12 The second paragraph asserts that the exclusive marketing agreement prohibits Double Dove from manufacturing any needle product utilizing automated retraction technology of any type, for any entity other than the respondent, without its prior consent, and that such consent has not been given. It is then asserted that Double Dove has possession of confidential and trade secret information belonging to the respondent which it has expressly agreed not to use or disclose, except for the benefit of the respondent. Confidential and trade secret information, by definition, cannot refer to the subject matter of a patent.</text>

<tocase>Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd v Meth [1961] HCA 33 ; (1961-1961) 105 CLR 440 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1961/33.html</AustLII>
<text>32 The applicant also submits that upon proof of unjustified threats, it is entitled, virtually as of right, to an injunction, although it concedes that there may be some residual discretionary basis upon which such relief might be declined. The applicant relies upon a decision of Fullagar J in Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd v Meth [1961] HCA 33 ; (1961-1961) 105 CLR 440. That case concerned an application for relief pursuant to s 121 of the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) (the "1952 Act"). That section was the analogue of s 128. At 448 his Honour said:
 
 'The only remaining question (apart from costs) is, I think, whether the remedies given by s 121 are discretionary or as of right. This is, I think, a difficult question. The corresponding English section (s.65 of the Patents Act 1949 ) says that, unless the Act threatened would be an infringement, the person aggrieved "shall be entitled" to the remedies of declaration, injunction and damages (if any damages have been sustained), but the difference of language in our s.121 does not suggest to my mind that any different meaning was intended, and the "unless" clause strongly suggests that the only answer the defendant may make to the action for threats is by way of proof of infringement of a patent. On the whole, I am of opinion that, having reached the conclusion which I have reached, I am bound to make a declaration and grant an injunction. I can see no strong affirmative reason why I should not do so, but, if I had thought that these remedies under the section were discretionary in the sense in which they are discretionary in equity, I should have had to take into account my belief that an injunction is entirely unnecessary, and that the truth most probably is that it was merely per incuriam that the "threat" was expressed too widely.'

33 Section 121 of the 1952 Act provided:
 
 'Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding for infringement of a patent, or some other like proceeding, then, whether the person making the threats is or is not entitled to or interested in a patent, or is or is not interested in an application for a patent, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned person and may obtain a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable, and an injunction against the continuance of the threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he has sustained, unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the proceedings were threatened constitute, or, if done, would constitute 
 
 
 
 (a) an infringement of a patent in respect of the claim in the specification which is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid; or 
 
 (b) an infringement of rights arising from the publication of the complete specification of a claim in the specification which is not shown to be one which would be invalid if a patent had been granted in respect of the complete specification.'

34 I have set out s 128 above. However, in comparing s 121 of the 1952 Act with the current statutory regime, the combined operation of ss 128, 129 and 129A must be considered. Section 128 provides that an aggrieved person may apply for particular relief, including an injunction. Section 129 provides that in the case of a standard patent or a standard patent application the court may grant such relief 'unless the respondent satisfies the court' of certain matters. Section 129A relates to innovation patent applications and innovation patents and is in similar form.

35 Although the combined wording of ss 128, 129 and 129A differs from that in the 1952 Act the distinctions are not compelling. The so-called "unless" clause referred to by Fullagar J appears in ss 129 and 129A. Section 121 of the 1952 Act provided that an aggrieved person might bring an action for appropriate relief, as does s 128. Section 121 provided that such person might obtain or recover such relief unless the threatening person satisfied the court that the threats were justified. Sections 129 and 129A are in similar form. The question, then, is whether I should follow the decision of Fullagar J in Steinhardt or depart from it. Given that I am unable to identify any significant difference in the wording of the respective statutory provisions, I would normally follow the decision. However the difficulty in the present case is that there is one English decision and two decisions of single judges of this Court which appear to be inconsistent with it.

37 Curiously, this case seems not to have been cited in Steinhardt . The reference to prima facie entitlement may suggest that there is little difference in the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal and that adopted by Fullagar J where his Honour referred to a 'strong affirmative reason why I should not' grant an injunction. However I doubt whether the cases can be reconciled on that basis. In each case the court appears to have been of the view that upon the considerations usually relevant to the grant of injunctive relief, such relief ought not to have been granted. Yet in Benmax the injunctive relief was declined whilst in Steinhardt , it was granted. I find the reasoning in Benmax to be persuasive. If I may say so, with respect, the reservation that Fullagar J had about his own conclusion would suggest that had his Honour's attention been drawn to Benmax , the outcome would have been different.

39 Again curiously, although his Honour appears to have been referred to the decision in Steinhardt , he seems not to have been referred to the passage concerning discretionary relief to which I have referred. Finally, in JMVB , Crennan J observed at [210]:
 
 'Once a threat has been established it is prima facie unjustifiable unless the person making the threat establishes that it was justified ... . The court may grant the relief applied for unless the person threatening infringement proceedings establishes that the relevant conduct infringes or would infringe a valid claim of a patent ... Ultimately, the grant of relief is discretionary: Townsend Controls at 475.'

<tocase>Benmax v Austin Motor Coy Ltd (1953) 70 RPC 284</tocase>
<text>36 In Benmax v Austin Motor Coy Ltd (1953) 70 RPC 284 at 295-296, Evershed MR (Jenkins and Morris LLJJ concurring) said:
 
 'There remains, however, the question whether the Defendants are right in suggesting that, if they are otherwise within the section (which for the purposes of the argument henceforth I will assume), they are entitled as of right to a declaration and an injunction. Now, it is quite true that the terms of the second subsection appear to be obligatory "the plaintiff shall be entitled to the following relief". But it would be startling if these words really were obligatory. The remedy of an injunction is one that has always been regarded as essentially a matter for discretion. Indeed, Sec.45 of the Judicature Act itself states that the power of the Court to grant an injunction is limited by this consideration, that the Court should grant an injunction when it considers it just or convenient. If the Defendants are right, in a case of this kind, the Court would be bound to grant an injunction though the Court considered it, as I should consider it in this case, both unjust and inconvenient. Moreover, it has never been the practice of the Court to grant injunctions which are on the face of them futile or meaningless. What would be the point of granting an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from threatening to bring an infringement action in respect of Letters Patent when by the same order the Court had revoked the Letters Patent, save perhaps to cast some doubt upon whether it really had been revoked? This section has emerged in the 1949 Act after considerable amendments in previous Acts. One of the problems which the section had earlier presented was solved by the removal from the present section of the former proviso that it had no application when an action for infringement was brought within a reasonable time after the alleged threat. I can see a sensible ground for removing that limitation. 
 
 In Sec.36 of the 1932 Act there was also this difference: after an opening passage which corresponds closely to the wording of the present Subsec.(1): "Where any person, by circulars, advertisements, etc, threatens any person" the old subsection continued: - "any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him and may obtain a declaration" to the effect that such threats were justifiable and an injunction and may recover damages "for such". Then Subsec.(2) read: 
 
 
 "The Defendant in any such action as aforesaid may apply, by way of counterclaim in the action, for any relief to which he would be entitled 'in a separate action in respect of any infringement' ." 
 
 
 
 It has been assumed, as I have already said, that this section is available as a matter of counterclaim, though at first sight I would incline to think, as I think the learned Judge thought, that it only contemplates actions to restrain threats as distinct from counter-claims in infringement actions; but I think the use of the phrase "the plaintiff shall be 'entitled' " is explained in some degree by the passage I have just read from Subsec (2) of the Act of 1936. 
 
 An instance was cited by Mr Whitford under the old Bankruptcy Act, namely, the case of In re Lord Furlough ([1895] 1 QB 724), where in this Court it was said that the word "shall", though it appears obligatory, is not always to be treated as more than directory. 
 
 There is this further point: from Subsec.(1) it is plain that a person aggrieved may not seek more than one or other of the remedies set out in Subsec.(2); yet, so far as I can see, if the Defendants are correct, once the action has been brought and the party who has made the threats has failed to justify, the Court is bound to grant all the relief, regardless of what the plaintiff may ask for. That cannot be right, and indeed I go further and say that I cannot believe that Parliament intended in regard to the grant of an injunction to make it obligatory in any sense for a Court, and particularly a Court of Equity, to grant an injunction. Unless the words are clear and beyond any possible doubt, I, for one, should absolutely decline to be so bound. In spite of the formula "the plaintiff shall be entitled", which in its context may not be quite happy, I am unable to construe and do not construe this section as compelling the Court, given the premises, to grant all or indeed any of the relief set out in Subs.(2). In my judgment the phrase "the plaintiff shall be 'entitled' " cannot mean more than this that the plaintiff shall be entitled prima facie .'

37 Curiously, this case seems not to have been cited in Steinhardt . The reference to prima facie entitlement may suggest that there is little difference in the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal and that adopted by Fullagar J where his Honour referred to a 'strong affirmative reason why I should not' grant an injunction. However I doubt whether the cases can be reconciled on that basis. In each case the court appears to have been of the view that upon the considerations usually relevant to the grant of injunctive relief, such relief ought not to have been granted. Yet in Benmax the injunctive relief was declined whilst in Steinhardt , it was granted. I find the reasoning in Benmax to be persuasive. If I may say so, with respect, the reservation that Fullagar J had about his own conclusion would suggest that had his Honour's attention been drawn to Benmax , the outcome would have been different.

38 The matter has been further complicated by decisions of two members of this Court. In Townsend Controls Pty Ltd v Gilead (1989) 16 IPR 469 at 474-475, von Doussa J considered the availability of injunctive relief pursuant to s 121 of the 1952 Act. His Honour concluded that, in default of defence, a declaration or injunctive relief could not be granted 'without prior inquiry into the merits' . His Honour then observed (at 475):
 
 'I consider the remedies of injunction and declaration should be treated as discretionary in the sense in which injunctions and declarations generally are discretionary in equity: See Benmax v Austin Motor Coy Ltd ... . Such relief should not be granted by consent or in default of appearance or appearance at trial unless it is established to the satisfaction of the court that is proper to do so.'

40 I would not readily depart from a view of a member of the High Court expressed at first instance, particularly a view expressed by Fullagar J. However his Honour would undoubtedly have given very considerable weight to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Benmax , had he been referred to it. That decision has, in effect, been followed by von Doussa and Crennan JJ, the decision of Crennan J being under the current legislation. I would normally follow the decision of another member of this Court unless satisfied that it was wrong. Far from being satisfied that her Honour's decision was wrong, I consider that it was correct. In those circumstances I conclude that the availability of declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to s 128 is discretionary.

41 The applicant is entitled to be vindicated in having brought these proceedings, but the declaration will serve that purpose. I conclude that it is unlikely that there will be any further unjustifiable threats from the respondent. This view is based upon the passage of time since the threats were made and the apparent care with which any such threats were avoided in the second letter. I decline to exercise my discretion in favour of granting an injunction.

42 I will hear submissions as to costs. 
 
 
 I certify that the preceding forty-two (42) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.
