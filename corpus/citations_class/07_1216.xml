<text>5 There would normally be much force in this submission. After all, it may just be a question of degree as to whether there will be a finding of contribution or a finding of no causation because of the actions of an applicant: see eg Argy v Blunts &amp; Lane Cove Real Estate Pty Ltd (1990) 26 FCR 112 at 138. However, for the purposes of proper case management, I consider it will assist in the further conduct of this proceeding to make a decision now on this issue, particularly as I have come to a clear view on the matter. In any event, my later consideration of the applicability of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act necessarily includes a consideration of this issue.</text>

<tocase>Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960</tocase>
<text>44 The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made:
 
 &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . 
 &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered.
 &#8226; "Belief" under O 15A r 6 requires more than mere assertion, a "hunch", conjecture or suspicion. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition: see: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] to [14]; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154.
 &#8226; The availability of preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 depends upon the evidence before the Court. . The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question: see Austrac Operations [2003] ATPR at [37]; John Holland Services [2004] FCA at [13] to [14], [17] and [73] and St George v Rabo 211 ALR at 154. 
 &#8226; The rule is one which should be construed beneficially. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J said:
 It is no answer to the applicant's application under r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a fishing expedition: cf Meth v Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd (1959) 33 ALJR 78 at 81. Rule 6 is designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent -- that is, to "fish" in the old sense... 
 
 It would be unfortunate if a rule designed to amplify the court's power to penetrate obscurities and uncertainties in the interests of justice were to be weakened by restrictive and unnecessary glosses. I think the rule is of a beneficial kind within the meaning of the well known principle of interpretation, and should be given the fullest scope its language will reasonably allow. The proper brake on any excesses in its use is the discretion of the court, which is required to be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case.

<text>32 However, even if Pt IVAA applies to these proceedings according to its own terms, I am of the view that Pt IVAA is not picked up by s 79 of the Judiciary Act because the Commonwealth Legislation "otherwise provides". In my view, the operation of the Commonwealth Legislation would so reduce the ambit of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act that the provisions of the Commonwealth Legislation are irreconcilable with it: Northern Territory v GPAO [1999] HCA 8 ; (1999) 196 CLR 553 at [78] to [83] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, and at [135] per Gaudron J; Austral Pacific Group Ltd v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136 at [17] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, at [53] per McHugh J, and at [106] per Callinan J; Macleod v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2002] HCA 37 ; (2002) 211 CLR 287 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.</text>

<tocase>Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd (1998) 83 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>24 It was argued by the respondents that just as other provisions of the Wrongs Act could apply based upon the operation of s 79 , there was no reason to form a different view in relation to Pt IVAA , and reliance was placed upon the authority of Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd (1998) 83 FCR 1. That case concerned the applicability of Pt IV of the Wrongs Act . Under Pt IV , contribution between defendants and third parties does not detract from the ability of a plaintiff to seek full damages or compensation against a defendant. A plaintiff is entitled to his or her full entitlement even though the defendant seeks contribution from another person. On the other hand, Pt IVAA will impact upon the ability of a plaintiff to obtain relief against a particular defendant. The defendant has the benefit of the limitation on liability. The considerations affecting the operation of Pt IVAA in my view are therefore entirely different to the considerations affecting the operation of Pt IV of the Wrongs Act as considered in Bialkower 83 FCR 1.

25 It is therefore necessary to consider the specific provisions of Pt IVAA relied upon by the respondents.

26 The first matter to determine is whether Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act is applicable in any event having regard to its own terms.

41 I need not delay considering this question any further, as the respondents can rely upon Pt IV of the Wrongs Act in seeking contribution from KPMG. Unlike Pt IVAA , Pt IV does apply to these proceedings by reason of the operation of s 79 of the Judiciary Act (see Bialkower 83 FCR 1). Of course, the respondents accepted that it is a requirement that KPMG owe a duty of care to the applicant to avoid the relevant economic loss if reliance is to be placed upon Pt IV of the Wrongs Act .

42 I now turn to the operation of O 15A r 6. It is convenient to deal with one preliminary matter, although it is unnecessary to do so in light of my conclusion that Pt IVAA has no application in these proceedings. KPMG submitted that O 15A r 6 had no application because there was no basis for the respondents to rely upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act in support of the contention that they may have a right to obtain relief from KPMG. I do not accept that submission. If the respondents could rely upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act so as to limit their liability to the applicant, the respondents must in the first instance be able to identify the existence of a concurrent wrongdoer within the meaning of s 24AH of the Wrongs Act . The alleged concurrent wrongdoer must then be joined as a party to the proceeding (see s 24AI(3)) , and will be a defendant within the meaning of s 24AE of the Wrongs Act . The respondents would then be able to rely upon any reduction in liability. The respondents before me would be able to seek, inter alia, declaratory relief against KPMG to the effect that KPMG is a concurrent wrongdoer within the meaning of s 24AH. It seems to me that any joinder of KPMG in these circumstances gives rise to the right to obtain relief by the respondents against the potential concurrent wrongdoer, namely KPMG, within the meaning of O 15A r 6. It does not matter that KPMG has no liability in monetary terms to the respondents, just that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG, in the events postulated, by way of declaration. There would clearly be a controversy between the respondents and KPMG, as there would be between each of them and the applicant.

43 In any event, as I have already indicated, in relation to the claims brought by the applicant against the respondents, the respondents may have a right to obtain contribution from KPMG pursuant to Pt IV of the Wrongs Act . There would be no question that the right to recover contribution within the meaning of Pt IV of the Wrongs Act would constitute a right to obtain relief against KPMG, irrespective of what the position may be if reliance could only be placed upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act .</text>

<tocase>Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 146</tocase>
<text>68 Of course, there are other policy considerations that may impact upon whether the court should deny the duty of care alleged here, namely the impact of prolonged and multiple actions against auditors, the availability of other civil and criminal proceedings against auditors, and the public interest in ensuring there are auditors ready and willing to perform their duties at a reasonable cost. These matters were raised in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 at 282 to 289 per McHugh J. They are matters which need to be considered, but none in my view are of sufficient weight in the context of my inquiry to conclude that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents could not give rise to a duty of care as alleged. It is still not possible to identify precisely a line of demarcation between the cases of pure economic loss in which damages are recoverable and those in which they are not recoverable, but I am not satisfied, even adopting the test under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, that this is a case where damages may not be recoverable: see generally Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 146.</text>

<tocase>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] UKHL 2 ; [1990] 2 AC 605</tocase>
<text>52 It was contended by KPMG that a company's auditor does not owe to a third party, such as a shareholder as an individual investor (rather than as a member of the company) or any other investor, a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss save in circumstances where the auditor has specifically and intentionally assumed responsibility for providing the third party with the relevant information for the purpose that it be relied upon by the third party in doing precisely what the third party did. Reference was made to Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 252, 258, 266 and 289; D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 35 per McHugh J; R Lowe Lippman Figdor &amp; Franck v AGC (Advances) Ltd [1992] 2 VR 671 at 682 and 685; Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] UKHL 2 ; [1990] 2 AC 605 at 629, 654 and 662; Hercules Management Ltd v Ernst &amp; Young [1997] 2 SCR 165 at [37].

53 In addition it was argued by KPMG that where audit reports are prepared pursuant to a statutory regime, the existence of potential civil and criminal liability under the relevant regime weighed against the further recognition of a separate duty to avoid economic loss owed by auditors to third parties, and the regime may be a determinative indication that audit reports were prepared for a statutory purpose rather than for the purpose of reliance by investors.

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Witherow [2006] VSCA 45</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2006/45.html</AustLII>
<text>17 In view of the definition of "damages" in s 24AE of the Wrongs Act , Pt IVAA would apply to the claims such as those made in these proceedings. I note that the definition includes "any form of monetary compensation". In my view, Pt IVAA would also apply to a claim for a sum certain (contrast with Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Witherow [2006] VSCA 45 at [10] to [11] although the extended definition of "damages" does not seem to have been discussed).

18 There are no proportionate liability provisions in the old Corporations Act . Proportionate liability provisions were introduced into the amended Corporations Act by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004 (Cth) ('CLERP Act'), Sch 3(4), which commenced on 26 July 2004: see s 2(1) of the CLERP Act. They are contained in Div 2A of Pt 7.10 and apply only to conduct done in contravention of s 1041H (which prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to a financial product or a financial service). They do not apply to ss 945A and 947C(2)(e) of the amended Corporations Act . Nor do they apply to s 1012A of the amended Corporations Act . Accordingly, there is no provision of the old Corporations Act or the amended Corporations Act which applies a proportionate liability regime to the causes of action pleaded by the applicant.

19 The proportionate liability provisions in subdiv GA of Div 2 of Pt 2 of the ASIC Act were introduced by Sch 3(2) of the CLERP Act, and apply to claims for damages under s 12GF for conduct done in contravention of s 12DA. They do not apply to the cause of action pleaded by the applicant under s 12DB of the ASIC Act.

40 For the reasons set out above, Pt IVAA cannot be relied upon by the respondents for the purposes of seeking relief against KPMG. If reliance could be placed upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , it was argued by the respondents that the existence of a duty of care being owed by KPMG to the applicant to avoid the relevant economic loss, as distinct from some other relevant party, may not be required. In my view, having regard to the language of ss 24AH(1) and 24AI (1), the operation of s 24AJ , and the fact that the loss or damage referred to in s 24AH(1) is not divisible in terms of causation, it seems to me that the concurrent wrongdoers must each have committed the relevant legal wrong against the applicant. This conclusion seems to be implicit in the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Witherow [2006] VSCA 45 , although the issue does not appear to have been addressed specifically.</text>

Reference was made to Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241 at 252, 258, 266 and 289; D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 35 per McHugh J; R Lowe Lippman Figdor &amp; Franck v AGC (Advances) Ltd [1992] 2 VR 671 at 682 and 685; Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] UKHL 2 ; [1990] 2 AC 605 at 629, 654 and 662; Hercules Management Ltd v Ernst &amp; Young [1997] 2 SCR 165 at [37].

54 It was also contended by KPMG that to the extent the respondents relied upon the concept of "vulnerability", this was misconceived because there was here a potential indeterminate liability and an ability by the investors (including the applicant) to protect themselves. Further, it was contended that the concept of "vulnerability" may not be used to circumvent the historical preconditions to a claim for negligent misstatement against auditors as set forth in such cases as Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241, when these preconditions establish the minimum threshold of "vulnerability" in factual situations in which they apply .

55 In considering these contentions, it is important to appreciate the context in which I am considering the issue of whether a duty of care as alleged by the respondents arises. My task is to determine, on this aspect, whether a duty of care may exist in the context of the principles I have identified previously in these reasons relevant to the application of O 15A r 6.

56 In this context, I have come to the conclusion that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondent may give rise to the alleged duty of care to avoid pure economic loss, such facts and elements being "salient features" which may give rise to the alleged duty.

57 On the basis of the material before me, I have not come to the view that the alleged duty of care is ill-founded or doomed to fail, or that, in adopting the test to be applied in considering an application under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the potential cause of action could be dismissed or struck out. I do not accept that Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241, and the other cases referred to by KPMG, lay down any preconditions to liability of auditors where we are not dealing with a claim for negligent misstatement and where the concept of vulnerability may become relevant and where all the salient features of the case need to be examined. No one salient feature is decisive, and all the facts and circumstances relied upon need to be considered. It can be accepted that auditors do not owe a duty as alleged merely by virtue of their acting in the capacity as auditors. However, more is relied upon by the respondents namely the facts and elements referred to earlier.

60 The concept of vulnerability is now an important requirement in providing a basis for a duty of care to avoid economic loss. It cannot be said that the decision in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 should not be considered in light of the concept of vulnerability. Both these propositions follow from the passage in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at [23] (footnotes omitted):
 
 Since Caltex Oil , and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. "Vulnerability", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, "vulnerability" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant. So, in Perre , the plaintiffs could do nothing to protect themselves from the economic consequences to them of the defendant's negligence in sowing a crop which caused the quarantining of the plaintiffs' land. In Hill v Van Erp , the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the client's retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done. But in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords , the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, rather than depend upon the auditor's certification of the accounts of the company.

61 As was observed though, in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, this being relevant to "vulnerability".

62 In Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 the appellant was a sophisticated investor well able in the circumstances to protect itself. It at least had a capacity to consider the investment, whereas in this proceeding the complaint is that the vulnerability arises after the making of the investment, where the investor arguably has no ability to look after itself. The concept of the ability to protect oneself is always relative and will depend upon many factors and circumstances. These are yet to be fully investigated in this proceeding.

68 Of course, there are other policy considerations that may impact upon whether the court should deny the duty of care alleged here, namely the impact of prolonged and multiple actions against auditors, the availability of other civil and criminal proceedings against auditors, and the public interest in ensuring there are auditors ready and willing to perform their duties at a reasonable cost. These matters were raised in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 at 282 to 289 per McHugh J. They are matters which need to be considered, but none in my view are of sufficient weight in the context of my inquiry to conclude that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents could not give rise to a duty of care as alleged. It is still not possible to identify precisely a line of demarcation between the cases of pure economic loss in which damages are recoverable and those in which they are not recoverable, but I am not satisfied, even adopting the test under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, that this is a case where damages may not be recoverable: see generally Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 146.

69 As I have said, I am considering the question of whether a duty of care may arise in the circumstances contended for by the respondents. Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 may well be an authority which raises many difficulties for the respondents, but it does not stand in the way of the possibility in the circumstances of this proceeding that a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss exists.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/62.html</AustLII>
<text>35 In support of the contention of the respondents that the provisions of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act should be seen as complementary, reliance was placed upon s 5E(1) and 5E (4) of the Corporations Act . Even if otherwise applicable to the Commonwealth Legislation, s 5E(1) and 5E (4) themselves cannot be of any assistance to the respondents in this regard. They deal with not excluding or limiting the concurrent operation of any State law provided there is no direct inconsistency. For the same reasons as indicated in Gordon v Tolcher [2006] HCA 62 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 507 at [30] , s 5E can have no impact in the present proceeding. Of its own force, the Wrongs Act can have no application in this proceeding without the aid of s 79 of the Judiciary Act .

36 Therefore, Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act cannot be relied upon by the respondents in this proceeding.

37 Finally on this issue, I mention that in the applicant's written outline, reference was made to s 109 of the Constitution although this matter was not further elaborated upon by the parties. In view of my conclusions, the operation of s 109 does not need any specific attention by me.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273</tocase>
<text>44 The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made:
 
 &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . 
 &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered.
 &#8226; "Belief" under O 15A r 6 requires more than mere assertion, a "hunch", conjecture or suspicion. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition: see: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] to [14]; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154.
 &#8226; The availability of preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 depends upon the evidence before the Court. . The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question: see Austrac Operations [2003] ATPR at [37]; John Holland Services [2004] FCA at [13] to [14], [17] and [73] and St George v Rabo 211 ALR at 154. 
 &#8226; The rule is one which should be construed beneficially. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J said:
 It is no answer to the applicant's application under r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a fishing expedition: cf Meth v Norbert Steinhardt &amp; Son Ltd (1959) 33 ALJR 78 at 81. Rule 6 is designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent -- that is, to "fish" in the old sense... 
 
 It would be unfortunate if a rule designed to amplify the court's power to penetrate obscurities and uncertainties in the interests of justice were to be weakened by restrictive and unnecessary glosses. I think the rule is of a beneficial kind within the meaning of the well known principle of interpretation, and should be given the fullest scope its language will reasonably allow. The proper brake on any excesses in its use is the discretion of the court, which is required to be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case.

53 In addition it was argued by KPMG that where audit reports are prepared pursuant to a statutory regime, the existence of potential civil and criminal liability under the relevant regime weighed against the further recognition of a separate duty to avoid economic loss owed by auditors to third parties, and the regime may be a determinative indication that audit reports were prepared for a statutory purpose rather than for the purpose of reliance by investors.

<tocase>I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/41.html</AustLII>
<text>6 It was accepted by the respondents that if the relief being sought was pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act ') then the position would be clear, and the plea of contributing fault sought to be relied upon the respondents could not be maintained based upon the authority of the High Court of Australia in I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109. I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109 is binding authority for the proposition that the loss that can be claimed under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act cannot be apportioned between contributing causes, and that once the causal link is established between the injury and the contravention, the measure of the loss for which s 82 provides, to which the person bringing the action is entitled, is the amount of the loss or damage sustained and not some lesser amount. Further, s 87(1) does not confer a discretion to reduce or modify an award of damages made under s 82(1).

7 The issue before the court in that case was one of statutory construction of the Trade Practices Act . Similarly, the question here is one of statutory construction of the Commonwealth Legislation.

8 It was contended by the respondents that there is a relevant distinction between the provisions of the Trade Practices Act referred to by the court in I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109 and the various provisions that are now relied upon by the applicant in this matter, so that the plea of contributing fault could be maintained, or at least was not clearly untenable. The respondents sought to rely upon the difference in wording of the Trade Practices Act and the Commonwealth Legislation.

9 In my view the difference in wording is not sufficient to take away the force of the court's reasoning in I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109 . The use of the words "because", or "as a result of" found in the old Corporations Act (for instance) seems to me to be relevantly equivalent in their context to the word "by" in the Trade Practices Act , which was a focus of the attention of the court in I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109.

10 Further, just as a relevant purpose of the Trade Practices Act is to proscribe misleading and deceptive conduct and, in aid of that purpose, to provide for compensation by an award of damages to a victim of such conduct, so here the Commonwealth Legislation similarly makes the respondents, if found liable, legally responsible for the whole of the loss.

11 As Gleeson CJ said in I &amp; L Securities 210 CLR at [33]:
 
 The relevant purpose of the statute was to proscribe misleading and deceptive conduct in circumstances which included those of the present case. In aid of that purpose, the statute provided for compensation, by an award of damages, to a victim of such conduct. The measure of damages stipulated was the loss or damage of which the conduct was a cause. It was not limited to loss or damage of which such conduct was the sole cause. In most business transactions resulting in financial loss there are multiple causes of the loss. The statutory purpose would be defeated if the remedy under s 82 were restricted to loss of which the contravening conduct was the sole cause. What is there, then, in the justice and equity of the particular case that might lead to a conclusion that the respondent should not be regarded as legally responsible for the whole of the loss, even though the contravention was a cause of the whole of the loss? Upon what principle might such responsibility be diminished? In a financing transaction, a lender takes security to protect itself against the risk of default by the borrower. One aspect of that risk is that the lender might have failed adequately to assess the borrower's capacity to service the debt. I cannot see why, as a matter of principle, such failure by a lender should be treated, in the application of s 82 , as a factor which diminishes the legal responsibility of a valuer by negativing in part the causal effect of the valuer's misleading conduct. The statutory rule of conduct found in s 52 , when applied to the relationship between a valuer and a prospective lender, gives rise to a legal responsibility in a case such as the present which extends to the whole of the loss of which the valuer's misleading conduct is a direct cause. 

Further, as Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed at [50]:
 
 If the causal link between injury and contravention is established, the measure of the compensation for which the section provides, and to which the person bringing the action is entitled, is the amount of the loss or damage sustained, not some lesser amount. In particular, it follows from the decision in Henville v Walker that there is nothing in s 82(1) , in other provisions of the Act, or in the policy of the Act, to suggest that a claimant's carelessness may be taken into account to reduce the amount of the loss or damage which the claimant is entitled to recover under s 82(1). 

Finally, as McHugh J stated at [102]-[104]:
 
 But there was one indivisible loss in this case. It might be just and equitable to hold that HTW should be held responsible for only two-thirds of that loss. But in terms of causation doctrine and in the absence of a statutory power of apportionment, it is liable for the whole loss. The approach of Williams J accords with apportionment cases involving contributory negligence. But, in the absence of any power in the Act to apportion responsibility for loss or damage under s 82 , it is not open to a court to make such an apportionment in making an award under s 82. 
 
 HTW contends that, unless the approach of Williams J is adopted, the policy of the Act to control smart practices and encourage fair trading would be frustrated. It submits that the construction for which I &amp; L contends would encourage a sophisticated, commercial lender, to treat the Act as providing a form of mortgage guarantee insurance. 
 
 However, as I said in Henville , the policy behind the legislation is furthered if the party whose conduct contravenes the legislation bears the entire loss. Moreover, relief under s 82 is available not only for breaches of s 52 but for breaches of other provisions in Pt V as well as those in Pt IV of the Act and Pts IVA , IVB and s 51AC after the amendments. The reasoning adopted by Williams J would be likely to lead to inconsistencies in applying s 82 across such a broad spectrum of regulatory provisions. Moreover, it is unlikely that rejecting the construction that Williams J placed on s 82 will have the consequences predicted by HTW. Intentionally refusing to make proper inquiries when advancing loan funds will usually be held to be a voluntary act that breaks the chain of causation between the breach of the Act and the lender's loss. A loss caused by the intentional conduct of the applicant will not ordinarily be characterised as a loss caused "by" the contravening conduct of the respondent.

12 In the same way, the contributing fault plea is contrary to the express purpose of the Commonwealth Legislation. The Commonwealth Legislation aims to regulate corporate and individual behaviour by prescribing rules of conduct and ascribing consequences for breaches of those rules of conduct. To allow the contributing fault plea would be to allow an interpretation of the Commonwealth Legislation contrary to its purposes in exactly the same way as reasoned by the court in I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109.

13 It is to be observed that the Commonwealth Parliament has introduced contributing fault provisions focusing on the conduct of an applicant in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (' Corporations Act ') that would, if here applicable, found a basis for a contributing fault plea: see eg s 1041I(1B). However, Parliament has not extended those provisions to cover ss 945A and 947C (2)(e) of the amended Corporations Act (which are the corresponding provisions to ss 851 and 849 respectively of the old Corporations Act ) or to cover s 1012A of the amended Corporations Act . Thus, Parliament has enacted express statutory contributing fault mechanisms into some but not all parts of the amended Corporations Act . Parliament has also enacted a contributing fault mechanism into s 12GF of the ASIC Act (s 12GF(1B)), which applies to conduct in contravention of s 12DA (but not s 12DB) of the ASIC Act.

14 It was contended by the applicant that these amendments confirm that a plea of contributing fault is not available under the Commonwealth Legislation. In respect of ss 851 and 849 of the old Corporations Act and s 1012A of the amended Corporations Act it was contended that the position has been maintained by the subsequent legislative changes, whereas the introduction of an express provision allowing for contributing fault in s 12GF of the new ASIC Act showed (it was contended) that it was not envisaged such a plea of contributing fault was available under s 12DB of the ASIC Act. I do not consider it necessary to consider the impact of these subsequent amendments, as I have come to a clear view as a matter of construction of the Commonwealth Legislation. In any event, it may not be appropriate to interpret the applicable legislation by reference to amending provisions: see generally Pearce &amp; Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) p 97 et seq.</text>

<text>51 The respondents accepted that it was unlikely that the applicant itself relied upon or was induced to take any act by reason of statements made by KPMG in its audit reports. I should indicate at the outset, contrary to the submission of KPMG, that this concession does not necessarily preclude an entitlement to relief. The potential cause of action against KPMG concerns not simply negligent misstatement; rather it involves allegations of negligent execution of an audit involving alleged negligent conduct. In these circumstances a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss may arise, based on vulnerability, without actual reliance on the part of an applicant: see eg Moorabool Shire Council v Taitapanui [2006] VSCA 30 ; (2006) 14 VR 55 at [37] to [43] per Maxwell J and the cases referred to therein and [179] per Ormiston and Ashley JJA.</text>

<text>44 The main issue that was argued before me was whether, within the meaning of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have the right to obtain relief from KPMG. On this question, some preliminary observations can be made:
 
 &#8226; It is necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist. That task requires the Court to conclude at least that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established. The test is an objective one, and it is not necessary to prove that each of the elements do in fact exist. The rule contemplates that there be reasonable cause to believe that the respondents may have a right to obtain relief: see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v New South Wales [2003] ATPR 41-960 at [11] and Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Page Kirkland Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 288 at [5] . 
 &#8226; If the cause of action on which an application for preliminary discovery is based could not succeed, is bound to fail, is ill-founded or is doomed to fail, then discovery ought not be ordered: Bradley v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1989] 1 All ER 961 at 963 to 964; Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 at 277. If the potential cause of action would not survive an application for summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ('Federal Court Act'), then discovery ought not to be ordered.

See also CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [23] per Tamberlin J.

77 The respondents relied upon a report of John Stewart of BDO Kendalls dated 19 April 2007 in an endeavor to demonstrate breach (and causation). I appreciate that no evidence has been adduced by KPMG and inferences may be drawn from a failure to call evidence in the appropriate case (see Paxus Services 99 ALR at 732 to 733), but this does not excuse the respondents from demonstrating that there is a reasonable cause to believe there may be an entitlement to relief.

78 Mr Stewart set out the following matters he was asked to address:
 
 
 &#8226; "My opinion as to whether there is, on a prima facie basis, reason to think that the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] for the periods ended 31 December 2002, 30 June 2003, 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004 ("enclosed financial reports") do not disclose a true and fair view of the financial position of [York Street] and [Market Street] " ; 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; "If I determine that, on a prima facie basis, there are reasons to believe the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] do not disclose a true and fair view of the financial position of what audit issues, in my opinion, appear relevant in considering the financial position of the companies: for instance, is there an issue as to whether the balance sheets of [York Street] and [Market Street] should have included a provision for doubt as to the recoverability of the loans to, respectively, Scots Church Development Ltd and 60 Market Street Trust" ; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; "Advice as to what KPMG documents I would require access to, to enable me to provide an expert opinion as to whether or not the KPMG audits of the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] were carried out with due skill and care for each of the years ended 30 June 2002, 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004".

79 In the report, Mr Stewart:
 
 (a) examined the reports to creditors prepared by the liquidators of York Street and Market Street; 

(b) looked at York Street's financial reports for the year ended 30 June 2003; and 
 
 (c) looked at Market Street's financial reports for the periods ending 31 December 2002, 30 June 2003, 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004.

103 Ultimately, the question of whether discovery should be ordered is a matter involving the exercise of judicial discretion.

<tocase>Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/36.html</AustLII>
<text>58 In Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180, by majority, the High Court of Australia held that the respondent owed a duty of care to the appellants. In his judgment, Gummow J said at [198] that the question was whether the salient features of the matter gave rise to a duty of care owed by the respondent, and that there was no simple formula which can mask the necessity for examination of the particular facts.

59 The facts or elements upon which the respondents rely support the contention that a party such as KPMG may owe a duty of care to a confined class comprising investors who had acquired promissory notes issued by either York Street or Market Street. In the present case, the vulnerability of the applicant arose subsequent to the making of the investment by reason of the loss of control over the use of the funds and the lack of capacity to take any steps to monitor the recoverability of the loan made by the mezzanine companies to the primary borrowing entity. There is a basis for concluding that KPMG either may have known or ought to have known of these facts, and that KPMG may have had the relevant control itself to take steps to protect the confined class of investors.

60 The concept of vulnerability is now an important requirement in providing a basis for a duty of care to avoid economic loss. It cannot be said that the decision in Esanda [1997] HCA 8 ; 188 CLR 241 should not be considered in light of the concept of vulnerability. Both these propositions follow from the passage in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2004) 216 CLR 515 at [23] (footnotes omitted):
 
 Since Caltex Oil , and most notably in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed. "Vulnerability", in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, "vulnerability" is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff's inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant. So, in Perre , the plaintiffs could do nothing to protect themselves from the economic consequences to them of the defendant's negligence in sowing a crop which caused the quarantining of the plaintiffs' land. In Hill v Van Erp , the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the client's retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done. But in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords , the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, rather than depend upon the auditor's certification of the accounts of the company.

63 As to the question of indeterminate liability as raised by KPMG it is necessary to make some observations. First, just because there is an exposure to potential indeterminate liability, this in itself does not preclude the existence of a duty of care to avoid economic loss. It is one factor, maybe a very important factor, in determining whether such a duty arises. It is not a principle of law, but only a policy consideration to take into account: see Perre 198 CLR at [32] per Gaudron J.

64 Secondly, as Hayne J commented in Perre 198 CLR at [336], it is important to understand what is meant by indeterminate liability. As his Honour said:
 
 It means more than "extensive" or "large". The damage suffered by persons affected by the defendant's negligence may be very large; there may be many who are affected. But neither of those considerations means that the liability is indeterminate. What is meant by indeterminate in the present context is that the persons who may be affected cannot readily be identified. That formulation invites attention to when this identification is to be possible: is it to be possible at or before the time of the negligent act or omission, or is it sufficient if it is possible to identify the class of those affected after the event? I do not think it necessary to say, in this case, whether identification at the later time would suffice. If, as here, it was possible to identify those who would be directly affected by the conduct concerned at the time of the act or omission that is said to be negligent, and it was known to the person alleged to have been negligent that that was possible, then the liability to those persons is not indeterminate.

65 I do not think that any question of indeterminate liability arises here because the promissory note holders could be readily identified at the time of the act or omission that is said to be negligent, and it would probably have been known by KPMG that that was possible. Further, it may have also been possible that KPMG would have known or have the means to know the nature of the likely losses to the promissory note holders.

67 I accept that to focus upon the promissory note holders as a class as a means of denying the existence of indeterminate liability is arbitrary, but as Hayne J said in Perre 198 CLR at [343]:
 
 It may be said that defining the class of those to whom the duty was owed as those growers and processors to whom the Western Australian regulation would apply directly, is to do no more than seize upon an arbitrary means for limiting liability that happens to be available in this case. But there are at least two answers to that contention. First, the application of any limiting mechanism (whether foreseeability alone, or, in cases of pure economic loss, foreseeability and some other criterion or criteria) will apply tests that will leave some persons within their reach and others beyond it. Any test is, to that extent, an arbitrary one.</text>

<tocase>Price Waterhouse v Kwan [2000] 3 NZLR 39</tocase>
<text>70 I mention one further matter for completeness. Whilst reliance was placed by the respondents on the decision in Price Waterhouse v Kwan [2000] 3 NZLR 39, I do not consider that decision is of much assistance to them. That case concerned whether auditors of a solicitors' trust account owed a duty of care to clients of the solicitors who had invested money through the trust account by means of the solicitors' nominee company. The court concluded that in light of the facts presented to it and in light of the relationship between the auditors, the solicitors and the latter's clients, there was sufficient proximity between the auditors and the clients to justify the imposition of a duty of care in tort, subject to such policy considerations as may suggest otherwise.

71 The factual circumstances of the decision in Kwan [2000] 3 NZLR 39 were quite different to this case, particularly having regard to the legislative environment and the policy considerations relied upon by the court. Of course, proximity is not the touchstone of liability in Australia. Whilst the special purpose nature of York Street and Market Street is similar to the special purpose of a solicitor's trust account, one cannot automatically apply the decision reached in Kwan [2000] 3 NZLR 39 to the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents in this case, particularly where the law in Australia in relation to this issue differs in its exposition from that in New Zealand.

72 However, for the reasons set out above, within the context of O 15A r 6, there is reasonable cause to believe that KPMG may owe a duty of care to the applicant to avoid pure economic loss as alleged by the respondents.

73 The next question is whether there is sufficient evidence before the Court to conclude that there may have been a breach of that duty and that that breach was causative of any loss.</text>

<text>52 It was contended by KPMG that a company's auditor does not owe to a third party, such as a shareholder as an individual investor (rather than as a member of the company) or any other investor, a duty of care to avoid pure economic loss save in circumstances where the auditor has specifically and intentionally assumed responsibility for providing the third party with the relevant information for the purpose that it be relied upon by the third party in doing precisely what the third party did.

<text>31 In these circumstances, where a respondent desires to rely upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , it will need to plead and prove each of the statutory elements, including the failure to take reasonable care. In a proceeding where the applicant does not rely upon any such failure, then the need for a particularised plea by a respondent may be particularly important for the proper case management of the proceedings: see eg Ucak v Avante Developments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 367 at [41] . It would be desirable at an early stage of proceedings for a respondent to put forward the facts upon which it relies in support of the allocation of responsibility it contends should be ordered. If a respondent calls in aid the benefit of the limitation on liability provided for in Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , then the respondent has the onus of pleading and proving the required elements.

In Hill v Van Erp , the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the client's retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done. But in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords , the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, rather than depend upon the auditor's certification of the accounts of the company.</text>
