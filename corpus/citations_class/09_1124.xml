<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited (2003) 214 CLR 51</tocase>
<text>Section 51AA incorporates into the Act the unwritten law in relation to unconscionable conduct thereby extending the remedies available under the Act for unconscionable conduct to the extent that this concept is presently part of the common law or equitable principles recognised by the courts. Unconscionable conduct is conduct which attracts a sufficient level of judicial opprobrium to support the grant of relief based on principles set out in specific equitable doctrines established by Courts of Equity: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited (2003) 214 CLR 51. Unconscionability is a concept which requires a high level of moral obloquy. It is not necessary for the party who has benefited from a transaction challenged as unconscionable to itself have created the special advantage which forms the basis of the unconscionability claim. It is sufficient if that party knows, or ought to have known, of the other party's situation of special disadvantage and takes unfair advantage of the opportunity presented: Louth v Diprose [1992] HCA 61 ; (1992) 175 CLR 621. A person will be under a special disadvantage if there are circumstances seriously affecting the ability of the person to make a judgement in his or her own best interests: Berbatis Holdings per Gleeson CJ at [5]. A person is not under a special disadvantage simply because of inequality of bargaining power: Berbatis Holdings .</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments (1996) 71 FCR 250 </tocase>
<text>In the present circumstances, the unconscionable conduct on the part of Zanok was the promise that, in return for a fee, the applicant would receive training and thereafter guaranteed skilled employment in circumstances where Zanok knew or ought to have known that many of the applicants were temporary residents and anxious to find skilled employment to assist with their applications for permanent resident status. This conduct constituted more than simply taking advantage of a superior bargaining position but involved an unconscientious exploitation of another's inability or diminished ability to conserve his or her own interests. Dangling the 'employment carrot' in return for a fee in circumstances in which the applicant faces having to leave Australia, constitutes a high level of moral obloquy especially where the promised employment does not exist: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments (1996) 71 FCR 250.

In the circumstances, the ACCC submitted the Court should make a declaration in terms of para 1 of the amended application.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Limited (2001) ATPR 41-801</tocase>
<text>The power to make a declaration is a discretionary one and the basis upon which it should be exercised is conveniently summarised by Kenny J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Henry Kaye and National Investment Institute Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1363 at [200] [201]. In Tobacco Institute of Australia Limited v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 , Sheppard J held that the concern of the Act with the public interest supported the view that the Court may, in appropriate cases, exercise its power to grant the declaratory relief to mark its disapproval of particular conduct engaged in contravention of the Act: [1993] FCA 83 ; [1993] 41 FCR 89 at 100 see also 106 per Foster J and 107 per Hill J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Limited (2001) ATPR 41-801 at [34] per Carr J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Limited [2001] FCA 1326 ; (2001) ATPR 41-840 at [18] per Lee J. In the circumstances, the ACCC submitted that the Court should make the declaratory relief sought in paras 1 9 of the amended application, particularly given the important public interest element involved and also having regard to the fact that the ACCC stands apart from other litigants in that its functions include the furtherance of those public interests. I agree.</text>

<text>In ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v TPC [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 , Lockhart J said that the Act permitted the granting of an injunction to deter an offender from repeating the offence and in TPC v Mobil Oil Australia Limited [1984] FCA 363 ; (1985) 4 FCR 296 , Toohey J said that even where there was no evidence to indicate the offenders intention to continue the offending conduct, it might be appropriate to mark the Courts disapproval by an injunction. In Glev Pty Limited v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Limited [1994] FCA 916 ; (1994) ATPR 41-299 , von Doussa J pointed out that in applications for an injunction under the Act there is an element of public interest involved and the Court should be slower to withhold relief.</text>

<tocase>Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 75B of the Act provides that a person is involved in a contravention of a provision of Part V (which includes ss 51AA, 52, 53B and 58 of the Act) where a person has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or a party to, the contravention. The words 'party to a contravention' refer to a person who participates in, or assents to, the contravention. To be regarded as participating, a person must have knowledge of the essential elements constituting the contravention: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 670. The evidence establishes that Mr Darley Stephen was knowingly concerned in or a party to the contraventions which the ACCC alleges as against Zanok. That evidence is contained in the following:

In the circumstances, the ACCC submitted the Court should make a declaration in accordance with para 8 of the amended application. For the reasons outlined above, including at [19] above, I agree.

The ACCC also submitted the evidence establishes that Ms Vanitha Darley was a person directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or a party to the contraventions of Zanok alleged by the ACCC. That evidence is contained in the following:</text>
