<tocase>Sutherland Publishing Company v Caxton Publishing Company Limited [1936] All ER 177</tocase>
<text>13 Subject to s 116(1C) , the Copyright Act contemplates that the Court may grant damages in respect of copyright infringement and in respect of conversion. In Sutherland Publishing Company Limited v Caxton Publishing Company Limited [1936] All ER 177 , the English Court of Appeal decided that the remedies given by ss 6 (for breach of copyright) and 7 (for conversion) of the English Copyright Act, 1911 were cumulative, not alternative remedies. Lord Wright, MR, explained (at 180-81) that:
 Both are claims for a wrong, each wrong being different from the other. The former is for a wrong done to an incorporeal right, copyright, the latter is for conversion of particular chattels, the infringing copies. The measure of damages is different. In the latter case the measure is the value of the copies, which by force of the statute are deemed to be the property of the plaintiff, from the mere fact of being brought into existence; whereas in the other case, the measure of damage is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright, as a chose in action. It was strenuously contended that where the infringement consisted in the multiplication and sale of copies of a work, the damages under the two sections would overlap and the injustice of giving double compensation would be committed. It may be true that in some cases there may be an overlapping of the damages under the two sections, but, as I have already explained, there are two separate and diverse causes of action, each of which must receive appropriate consideration when it comes to the question of damages. ... It must be left to the good sense of the tribunal which assesses the damages to avoid giving excessive damages. 

Subsection 116(1C) addresses the considerations raised in this second paragraph, requiring the Court to form an opinion as to the sufficiency of the relief to be granted under s 115 of the Copyright Act. (The formulation of the measure of damages for copyright infringement in the first paragraph of the above passage may be misleading in some circumstances: see, e.g., Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 (" Autodesk ") at 475 per Wilcox J.)</text>

21 The infringement was flagrant in the sense that it was a "deliberate and calculated" infringement of the applicants' copyright: see Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library [1980] RPC 193 at 208 per Brightman J, cited with approval by Wilcox J in Autodesk at 478. In this regard, I refer to the findings at [65], [66], [67] and [77] in Boyapati (No 1) . The respondents acted in disregard of copyright notices: see Boyapati (No 1) at [70] and [77]. There was, furthermore, a continuing disregard of the applicants' rights even after the applicants had given notice of the infringement: see Boyapati (No 1) at [69].

<tocase>TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444</tocase>
<text>14 I accept that, as the applicants maintain, the provision to a student of an infringing copy of an Icarus College practice exam was an actionable conversion, the measure of damages being the market value of the exam. So calculated, conversion damages may be awarded under s 116. The applicants accept that, on this analysis, damages under s 115(2) would be confined to indirect losses, such as the diminution of goodwill or any loss associated with the failure to enhance goodwill or reputation: see TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 496 per Finkelstein J and Prior v Sheldon (2000) 48 IPR 301 at 321-22 per Wilcox J. This would apparently prevent any overlap of the kind that s 116(1C) is intended to avoid.</text>

<tocase>Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 64 IPR 18</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/228.html</AustLII>
<text>15 Ultimately, however, the court cannot form an opinion as to the sufficiency of relief under s 115 of the Copyright Act until relief under s 115 is granted or the court has reached a definite view about the relief it proposes to grant under this provision: compare Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 64 IPR 18 at [119] - [121] per Jacobson J. Furthermore, I accept that, as the applicants submit, the assessment of conversion damages should begin with the respondents' discovery of data that would permit the reliable assessment of the number of times that the infringing exams were downloaded by students for their use. If this data were unavailable, then there would be a need to consider other bases for calculating conversion damages.

16 In the circumstances, it suffices to say, at this stage, that, subject to the opinion of the Court under s 116(1C), the applicants are entitled to an assessment of conversion damages under s 116(A), as well as infringement damages under s 115.

17 Subsection 116(1D) provides that, in deciding whether to grant relief in an action for conversion and in assessing the amount of damages payable, the court may have regard to the following:
 
 
 
 (a) the expenses incurred by the defendant, being a person who marketed or otherwise dealt with the infringing copy, in manufacturing or acquiring the infringing copy;
 (b) whether the expenses were incurred before or after the infringing copy was sold or otherwise disposed of by the defendant; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) any other matter that the court considers relevant.</text>

<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>29 By virtue of s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the Court may make orders as to costs. The power, which is discretionary, must be exercised judicially: see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. Within this general discretion, it is accepted that costs ordinarily follow the event, with the result that a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order: see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>30 The usual rule is that costs are payable on a party and party basis, unless the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the normal course: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 233 per Sheppard J and O 62 of the Rules. In Colgate-Palmolive , Sheppard J referred to the circumstances in which indemnity costs might be awarded, mentioning, amongst other things, "the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued ... in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law" and "the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions", though noting that "[t]he question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis": see Colgate-Palmolive at 233-34. The Full Court reconsidered the appropriateness of an indemnity costs award in Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 (" Re Wilcox ") at 152-53 per Black CJ and 156-58 per Cooper and Merkel JJ. In Re Wilcox , at 156-57, Cooper and Merkel JJ reiterated Sheppard J's approach, saying:
 
 In order to exercise the discretion [regarding costs] judicially the following principles have been accepted by the Court as applicable: 
 (a) the Court ought not to depart from the rule that costs be ordered on a party and party basis unless the circumstances of the case warrant the Court in departing from the usual course; 
 (b) the circumstances which may warrant departure from the usual course arise as and when the justice of the case so requires or where there may be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the usual course; 
 (c) whilst the circumstances in cases in which indemnity costs have been ordered offer a guide, the question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for costs other than on a party and party basis. 
 

See also Abbott v Random House Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1540 at [5] per Beaumont, Miles and Drummond JJ, quoting the above passage with approval. Even more recently, the Full Court in Hamod v New South Wales [2002] FCA 424 ; (2002) 188 ALR 659 at 665 (per Gray J, with whom Carr and Goldberg JJ agreed) explained the basal principle for an award of indemnity costs in the following terms:
 
 Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail. They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty. Rather, they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs.</text>

<tocase>Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1823.html</AustLII>
<text>31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13] , [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J.

40 As Gilmour J said in Barrett at [23]-[24]:
 The general rule under Order 62 rule 3(3) may be departed from where the party in whose favour the costs order was made was required by the interlocutory proceeding to 'incur significant costs over and above those which it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence': Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 ; where the proceeding is complex and its final resolution is a long time away: Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1995] FCA 660 ; Readymix Holdings International Pty Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1297: Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) [2004] FCA 347. In McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 163 9, Weinberg J adopted the observation of Lindgren J in Allstate that: 
 
 ... the power to order that costs be paid forthwith should perhaps be used less sparingly than it has in the past. This is particularly so in lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn. Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly for years, for that to occur. 
 

In Barrett , Gilmour J referred to a number of cases in which the unsuccessful respondents in intellectual property cases were ordered to pay costs forthwith: see Barrett at [26]-[28]. As his Honour noted, however, each case depends very much on its own circumstances.

41 Having regard to the nature of the case, including the claims and diverse cross-claims that it involved, the evidence adduced by the parties, and the length of the trial, it may safely be assumed that the applicants have already incurred substantial costs. These costs are independent of the quantum of damages, which has yet to be established. The disposition of the quantum case may be some way off. Moreover, the applicants submit that "[t]he claim for damages may be rendered nugatory by the fact that the second respondent is once again bankrupt and by the first respondent's uncertain financial position". The respondents have not disputed this proposition. In the circumstances, it is appropriate that there be an order that the costs of the proceeding to date of the applicants/cross- respondents be paid forthwith.

42 The applicants also seek liberty to apply for an order that the costs in their favour be fixed in a gross sum in accordance with O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Rules. They note (and the respondents do not dispute) the second respondent's current status as an undischarged bankrupt. They also note (and the respondents do not dispute) that the first respondent is a foreign corporation registered to conduct business in Australia without obvious assets in Australia. As already observed, the costs involved are likely to be substantial. Having regard to the course of the proceeding to date, it may reasonably be assumed that taxation will be drawn-out and expensive. The applicants may well be obliged to meet the entire financial burden. In these circumstances, the applicants have liberty to apply for an order that the costs in their favour be fixed in a gross sum in accordance with the Rules.</text>
