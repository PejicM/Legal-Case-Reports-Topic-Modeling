<tocase>Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/232.html</AustLII>
<text>8 The Court's jurisdiction under s 44(1) is limited to pure questions of law: Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 , at [11]-[16]; Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 97ALD 593 at [35].

10 Whether a decision gives rise to a question of law that will support an appeal under s 44(1) requires consideration of how the decision was arrived at and the point that the appellant seeks to raise: Price Street Professional Centre at [25]. The Court must consider the question sought to be raised and the grounds relied upon: see Birdseye at [18]; Price Street Professional Centre at [40]. The grounds required to be specified in the notice of appeal "are the grounds upon which the appellant will argue that the answers for which it contends to the questions of law entitle it to the relief which it seeks": HBF Health Funds Inc v Minister for Health and Aging [2006] FCAFC 34 ; (2006) 149 FCR 291 at [6] .

11 Any questions of law identified by the applicant must relate to the decision under appeal in such a way that a favourable answer to the question will disclose an error affecting the Tribunal's decision: Birdseye at [23] and [28].

12 During argument counsel for the applicant effectively abandoned the stated questions of law and said that the error of law relied upon was the failure of the Tribunal to take into account the applicant's explanation for failing to comply with his obligations under s 161 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("the ITAA Act ") as relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 251K , whether to cancel the applicant's registration as a tax agent.

13 The two issues for the Tribunal were:
 
 
 (a) whether the applicant had been convicted of serious taxation offences, so that the applicant is not a fit and proper person in the relevant sense; and 
 
 (b) whether the registration of the applicant as a tax agent should be cancelled under s 251K(2) of the ITAA Act because of those offences, the applicant's history of non-compliance of income tax returns, including his non-lodgement of income tax returns since 2000.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/27.html</AustLII>
<text>9 The grounds are formulated as four separate questions concerning matters of law. However, the competency of the appeal depends on the identification of questions which are properly characterised as questions of law, as the subject of the appeal: Price Street Professional Centre , at [22]; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at [14] .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/111.html</AustLII>
<text>6 The discretion to extend time to institute an appeal is not expressly confined. Some relevant considerations are to be found in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 (in respect of applications for extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth)). These have been applied to applications under s 44: Peczalski v Comcare (1999) 58 ALD 697 at [19]; Dent v Australian Electoral Commissioner [2008] FCAFC 111 at [48] . They include relevantly for present purposes the following: 
 
 
 (a) The application should not be granted unless the Court is satisfied that it is proper so to do. The prescribed period is not to be ignored: Ralkon Agricultural Co Pty Ltd v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550. Although it is not an essential pre condition for a favourable exercise of the discretion that the applicant show an acceptable explanation for the delay, it is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given: Comcover v A'Hearn [1993] FCA 498 ; (1993) 45 FCR 441. 
 
 (b) The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account, considering whether an extension of time should be granted.</text>
