<tocase>Agawam Company v Jordan , 74 US 583 (1868)</tocase>
<text>13 The final case from the Supreme Court is Agawam Company v Jordan , 74 US 583 (1868). It is a leading case. There is a passage in the judgment of Justice Clifford which is regarded as a classic statement of the applicable principle. It reads (at 602-603): 
 
 "No one is entitled to a patent for that which he did not invent unless he can show a legal title to the same from the inventor or by operation of law; but where a person has discovered an improved principle in a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, and employs other persons to assist him in carrying out that principle, and they, in the course of experiments arising from that employment, make valuable discoveries ancillary to the plan and preconceived design of the employer, such suggested improvements are in general to be regarded as the property of the party who discovered the original improved principle, and may be embodied in his patent as a part of his invention. 
 
 Suggestions from another, made during the progress of such experiments, in order that they may be sufficient to defeat a patent subsequently issued, must have embraced the plan of the improvement, and must have furnished such information to the person to whom the communication was made that it would have enabled an ordinary mechanic, without the exercise of any ingenuity and special skill on his part, to construct and put the improvement in successful operation."</text>

<tocase>Clothworkers of Ipswich Case, The (1615) 1 Godb 252</tocase>
<text>3 The patent system in England had its origins in the royal grants by which monopolies in trade and manufacture were conferred by the Crown in the exercise of the prerogative. These monopolies were granted to "any man [who] by his own charge and industry, or by his own wit or invention, doth bring any new trade into the realm": Darcy v Allin (1602) Noy 173, 182. In his Institutes , Sir Edward Coke said: "The reason wherefore such a privilege is good in law is because the inventor bringeth to and for the common wealth a new manufacture by his invention, costs and charges, and therefore it is reason, that he should have a privilege for his reward (and the encouragement of others in the like) for a convenient time": 3 Coke's Institutes 184. The monopoly could be granted not only to the inventor but also to the person who first brought the new invention into England: The Clothworkers of Ipswich Case (1615) 1 Godb 252; Shepherd's Abridgment , Pt III, Prerog, 61; Hawkins Pleas of the Crown , vol 1, c 29, s 20.</text>

<tocase>Davies Shephard Pty Ltd v Stack [2001] FCA 501 ; (2001) 51 IPR 513</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/501.html</AustLII>
<text>16 Now it is clear that when Parliament enacted s 32 of the 1903 Act it intended that a patent would be granted only to the true (Parliament used the word "actual") inventor or a person claiming under him. In particular, "capitalists" could no longer take an interest in a patent, save as assignee. Nor could a patent be granted to the "importer" of an invention unless he had the consent of the inventor. Moreover, one necessary consequence of the adoption (with the limited exception of the importer with consent) of the US model was that a patent that was granted to one of two inventors was not granted to the "actual inventor". Nor was a patent granted to the "actual inventor" if it was granted jointly to two or more persons one of whom was not the inventor. The position must be the same under the 1990 Act for there is no material difference in language. This conclusion accords with the result in Davies Shephard Pty Ltd v Stack [2001] FCA 501 ; (2001) 51 IPR 513, although I have reached it by a different process of reasoning.

17 The respondents say that even if the grant be contrary to s 15, the patents in suit cannot be revoked. They put the argument as follows. First, the power to revoke is to be found in s 138(3). That sub-section provides that the court may revoke a patent on any of the following grounds: 
 
 (a) that the patentee is not entitled to the patent; 
 (b) that the invention is not a patentable invention; 
 (c) that the patentee has contravened a condition in the patent; 
 
 
 (d) that the patent was obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; 
 (e) that an amendment of the patent request or the complete specification was made or obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; 
 (f) that the specification does not comply with subsection 40(2) or (3). 
 
 

The next step is that, seeing that it is permissible to issue a patent to joint inventors, the words "the patentee is" in s 138(3)(a) must, in the case of a joint grant, be read as "the patentees are" (see also s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)). The conclusion that is then said to follow is that a patent can only be revoked under paragraph (a) if all "the patentees [are] not entitled to the patent."

18 I do not agree with this construction of s 138(3)(a). I accept, as I obviously must, that in the case of a joint patent it is proper to read s 138(3)(a) as covering joint patentees. Nonetheless, such a reading does not carry the respondents' argument. If one of several patentees is not entitled to the patent, then it is still correct to say (as it would be in the case where none of the patentees were entitled) that "the patentees are not entitled to the patent".</text>

<tocase>Gibbons v Ogden , 22 US 1 (1824)</tocase>
<text>11 In light of what was said by Mr Higgins during the debate on the 1903 Act, to ascertain the meaning of "inventor", as well as the intended effect of s 32, it is necessary to look at the "decisions in the United States" that Mr Higgins most likely had in mind. They are decisions which consider the Patents clause of the US Constitution , Art I SS 8 , cl 8 (giving Congress the power to secure to "inventors" the "exclusive right to their discoveries") and, in some instances, the early US patent statutes (under which a patent could be granted to the person who "hath or have invented or discovered" (1790), or had "invented" (1793), or had "discovered or invented" (1836), a new and useful art). There are three decisions of the US Supreme Court that are likely candidates. The first is Gibbons v Ogden , 22 US 1 (1824). This was not a patent case but it did discuss the Patents clause in the following passage from the judgment of the court (at 58-59) delivered by Chief Justice Marshall: 
 
 "The power, as granted in the constitution, is a limited power. It is a clear principle, that when the means of executing any given power are specified in the grant, Congress cannot take, by implication, any other means, as being necessary and proper to carry that power into execution. This power, then, is limited: (1) As to the persons and objects in regard to which it may be exercised: these are, 'authors and inventors, writings and discoveries.' This enumeration excludes all right in Congress to legislate on the subject of any improvement, which is not an 'invention', either domestic or foreign. It excludes also all right to legislate for the benefit of any person who is not himself 'the inventor'. (2) As to the means of executing the power, and the time during which those means may be exercised. They are by 'securing the exclusive right for limited times.'"</text>

<text>19 The respondents also contend that, having regard to the use of the present tense in s 138(3)(a), a condition precedent to a revocation order is a finding that the patentees were not entitled to the patent at the time of the application for revocation (or perhaps at the time of the hearing). I am far from persuaded that this construction is correct and it seems to be contrary to the views of Cooper J in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525, 536 and Crennan J in JMBV Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1474 , [130]-[131]. But even if this construction were correct, the way in which I would read the section is that if a person were not entitled to the patent at the time of grant then, at least in most cases, that non-entitlement would be (as here) a continuing state of affairs. So there is really nothing in the point.</text>

<text>4 The first statute which regulated the grant and sole use and exercise of an invention was the now famous Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac 1, c 3. By this statute, which was declaratory of the common law, it was provided, in the sixth section, that a patent could be granted to the "true and first inventor or inventors" of any new manufacture. The inventor was the person who made the discovery; that is, the idea for it originated in his own mind: Jones v Pearce (1831) 1 WPC 121, 124. The inventor was also the person who first introduced the invention into the realm: Edgeberry v Stephens (1693) 2 Salk 447.

<text>12 The second case is Kennedy v Hazelton , 128 US 667 (1888). This was an action for the specific performance of an agreement to assign a patent. The defendant, however, was not the true inventor. The action failed. Justice Gray delivered the opinion of the court. He said (at 672): "The patent law makes it essential to the validity of a patent, that it shall be granted on the application, supported by the oath, of the original and first inventor, (or of his executor or administrator,) whether the patent is issued to him or to his assignee. A patent which is not supported by the oath of the inventor, but applied for by one who is not the inventor, is unauthorized by law, and void, and, whether taken out of the name of the applicant or of any assignee of his, confers no rights as against the public."</text>
