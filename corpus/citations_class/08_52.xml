<tocase>Kay v Comcare [2006] AATA 50</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/AATA/2006/50.html</AustLII>
<text>37 The applicant submits that the logical consequence of the application of Wiegand 72 ALD 795 had been demonstrated by the Tribunal's decision in another case ( Kay v Comcare [2006] AATA 50): 
 
 While I am satisfied that various incidents occurred which Ms Kay perceived as harassment or discrimination, I accept the conclusion reached by Dr Duldig [that there was no evidence of workplace harassment]. However, it was also submitted that, even if there had been no actual harassment, it was sufficient that Ms Kay believed that this was occurring and that this perception was sufficient to establish the causal association under the Act . I also accept that submission: see Rodriguez and Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] FCA 1400 and Wiegand v Comcare (2002) 72 ALD 795.

38 According to the applicant, while it is possible for a disease to arise whilst an employee is physically at the workplace and equally possible that an event in the workplace may by an unreasonable perception lead to the development of a disease, in such cases it cannot be said, without more, that the Commonwealth employment has contributed in a "material degree" to the disease, or an aggravation of the disease.

39 The applicant argues that the proper construction of the term "disease" in s 4 requires that the Commonwealth work of the claimant must make a material contribution to the ailment or the aggravation. That in turn requires that the work with the Commonwealth, rather than an unreasonable perception of the work, be the material contribution. The applicant submits that support for this construction can be found in the second reading speech of the Bill which introduced the Act . The relevant Minister then said:
 
 Under the existing Act an employee was required to establish only that his or her employment was a contributing factor in the contraction of a disease.
 ...
 It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she was engaged.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/262.html</AustLII>
<text>47 This matter was considered by a majority (French and Stone JJ) of the Full Court of this Court in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 and by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. I respectfully agree with what their Honours have said.

48 The legislative history is that in the antecedent 1971 Act (the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth)) the definition of disease did not require a "material" contribution by the employment. In Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316, the Full Court had diminished the significance to be accorded to the term "material" in the 1988 (and current) Act, saying (at 323) that all it required was "that features of the employment did in fact and in truth contribute to the condition complained of" and that "[o]nce the link is established, however, it matters not that the contribution be large or small". In Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; 148 FCR 232 the majority considered that that approach failed to have regard to the legislative history and the Minister's statement in the second reading speech to the Bill which became the 1988 Act, that the new test, constituted by the qualification of the contribution that it be "material", "will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease " (emphasis added).</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536</tocase>

<text>47 This matter was considered by a majority (French and Stone JJ) of the Full Court of this Court in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 and by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. I respectfully agree with what their Honours have said.

49 In Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536 at [15] - [16] , Finn J concluded:
 
 There are, in my view, obvious hazards in allowing finely nuanced differences in dictionary definitions to contrive the answer to this question, given as I have noted, that the word "material" in this context had its legislative meaning set in part by the qualification it imposed on the nature of the contribution required to be demonstrated before the provisions of the SRC Act were engaged. This said I consider that one of the meanings of the word "materially" in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary probably captures the essence of what the legislature was conveying. That meaning is 
 
 "4. In a material degree; substantially, considerably." 
 
 An example given of this usage is that of contributing "materially to the funds required" for a purpose. This usage probably comes closer to what Davies J in Bendy described (at 325) as the "loose sense" of the definition of "material" in the Macquarie dictionary " namely, 'of substantial import or much consequence' [rather than the] legal sense of 'pertinent' or 'likely to influence '".
 
 Bearing in mind that the course of statutory construction is often not aided by substituting for the word used in an enactment, another word which is not so used, probably the best that can ultimately be said is that the s 4 definition: 
 
 
 (i) requires a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment, etc suffered than that exacted by the 1971 Act;
 (ii) "in a material degree" requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment, etc, in question ("the threshold evaluation");
 (iii) whether this will be so in a given case will be a matter of fact and degree.
 (Emphasis in original.)

50 Insofar as observations in Wiegand 72 ALD 795 may suggest that some less onerous view of "in a material degree" than that just discussed is appropriate, then such observations should, in my view, no longer be followed.</text>

<tocase>Westgate v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 17 FCR 235</tocase>
<text>51 However, the Tribunal is not shown to have applied any such unduly generous test: the Tribunal relied on Wiegand 72 ALD 795 only to reject the applicant's assertion that it needed to be shown that the workload required of Ms Caire was "excessive". In that regard, in my opinion, von Doussa J's approach in Wiegand 72 ALD 795 was correct, and there was no error of law arising from the Tribunal's reliance on it. An alleged contribution which is merely imagined by the employee, in circumstances where the employment was in truth, in the apt phrase of Davies J in Westgate v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1987) 17 FCR 235, an "inert" factor will plainly not suffice. But that was expressly acknowledged in Wiegand 72 ALD 795 at [24] and [25] and there was no suggestion to the contrary here.

52 Nothing the Tribunal said denies that some aspect of the employment must make an actual contribution to the ailment in question, which must be a contribution in a material degree. The Tribunal found as a matter of fact that Ms Caire had to fulfil from time to time "a heavy workload" notwithstanding ameliorative effects on behalf of the applicant. Whether such workload warranted the epithet "excessive" was, as the Tribunal observed, immaterial. Nor is this a case where any error through application of some wrong concept of "in a material degree" should be inferred. The Tribunal did not decide the matter on the basis that an actual but bare contribution would suffice. It is clear that the Tribunal found that there was an important contribution to the upper limb disease by the keyboard work actually undertaken by Ms Caire. The dispute before the Tribunal had been one about whether there was much of any such work undertaken by her.

53 It may be said at the outset that s 7(7) embodies such a draconian concept that it may be doubted whether its terms do not exceed what might be thought to be any rational underlying policy. Counsel for the applicant in submissions suggested that:
 
 Section 7(7) is intended to ensure that a claimant seeking the protection of beneficial legislation does so with honesty, truthfulness and openness. Such qualities are essential to ensure the proper administration of public funds, particularly in the context of legislation which is beneficial and not adversarial.</text>
