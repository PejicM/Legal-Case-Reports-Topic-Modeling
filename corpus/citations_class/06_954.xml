<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/1.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In this context, the notion of "jurisdiction" is the authority to hear and decide to adjudicate: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at 570 [2] . One needs, of course, to recognise that within, and bound up with, that notion of authority to adjudicate there is the authority to adjudicate the kind of controversy involved (what might be said to be the subject matter of any proceeding) and also the authority to deal with the particular respondent involved. The second aspect of the question may depend on presence within the jurisdiction (the word "jurisdiction" being used here in a territorial or locality sense) or whether relevant local law entitles the service of process outside the jurisdiction: see the comments of Branson J in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 at 349 [149] . In Edensor Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J and Gummow J said at 570 [2]:
 
 It is convenient to begin with the word "jurisdiction". This is a "generic term" generally signifying authority to adjudicate. It is used in various senses. The jurisdiction of a court to hear and determine a personal action and to grant relief may depend upon no more than effective service of that court's process upon the defendant within the territorial bounds of its competence or pursuant to the exercise of a "long-arm" jurisdiction; or it may depend also upon the proceeding being with respect to a particular subject matter.

<tocase>Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA [1996] 3 NZLR 641</tocase>
<text>75 As the High Court said in The 'Shin Kobe Maru' the question is whether a claim made bears a certain legal character. The High Court in that case also said (at 422) that the word "claim":
 
 ...would ordinarily be construed as the assertion of a right or interest recognized by the law and carrying an entitlement to relief. 
 

This analysis must be undertaken "by reference to the nature of the plaintiff's case as put forward, without reference to ... whether it is likely to succeed or not": The 'Moschanthy' [1971] 1 Lloyd's Rep 37 at 42. See also Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA [1996] 3 NZLR 641 at 647-48. Statements in some of the cases of the necessity to show some strength in the case before the jurisdiction of the court is attracted (that is before the court is legitimately seized of authority to adjudicate) appear impermissibly to combine the attraction of jurisdiction with its exercise: cf The 'Bass Reefer' (1992) 37 FCR 375.

<text>51 The recognition of this international character of the jurisdiction (and so the law which the judges ascertain and declare in the exercise of such jurisdiction) does not elevate the resolution of such controversies (or the applicable law governing their resolution) above the municipal context or above municipal law: American and Ocean Insurance Co v 356 Bales of Cotton 26 US 511 (1828) at 545-46, The 'Lottawanna' 88 US 558 (1875) at 573-75, The 'Western Maid' 257 US 419 (1922) at 432, Moragne v States Marine Lines Inc 398 US 375 (1970) at 386-88, The 'Tojo Maru' [1972] AC 242 at 290-91 and Blunden v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 73 ; (2003) 218 CLR 330 at 337-78 [13] ; but it does illuminate the broad source and scope of the jurisdiction. Further, of course, the fundamental place of ss 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) in the resolution of controversies in the exercise of federal jurisdiction is to be recognised: see the discussion by Gummow J in this respect in The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (FC) at 87.

52 For present purposes, it is unnecessary to explore the boundaries of s 76(iii). It is sufficient to recognise that the ALRC, in recommending, as it did, a defined list of maritime claims in s 4 of the draft legislation (which became s 4 of the Act), was not intending to exhaust the field of the jurisdiction encompassed within s 76(iii): see ALRC Report at [193]-[195]. There is, therefore, jurisdiction encompassed within the reach of s 76(iii) which Parliament has not conferred on federal courts and invested in State courts as federal jurisdiction under the Act. This is important to recognise in the operation of the Act, in particular in respect of the associated jurisdiction contemplated by s 12, to which I will come.
 The Act and its interpretation

53 The Act deals with "jurisdiction" in Part II (ss 9 to 13). The conferral and investiture of jurisdiction effected by ss 9 and 10 is by reference to actions in personam and actions in rem . Sections 9 and 10 are in the following terms:
 
 s 9 
 
 (1) Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court, the Federal Magistrates Court and on the courts of the Territories, and the courts of the States are invested with federal jurisdiction, in respect of proceedings commenced as actions in personam : 
 (a) on a maritime claim; or 
 (b) on a claim for damage done to a ship. 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not confer on a court other than the Federal Court or a Supreme Court of a Territory, or invest a court of a State other than the Supreme Court of a State with, jurisdiction in respect of limitation proceedings. 
 
 
 s 10 
 Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court and on the Supreme Courts of the Territories, and the Supreme Courts of the States are invested with federal jurisdiction, in respect of proceedings that may, under this Act, be commenced as actions in rem .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/256.html</AustLII>
<text>94 As to pilotage, the claim is one which complains of the faulty undertaking of the pilot. Global Peace was under compulsory pilotage. The owner of Global Peace was thereby answerable for any loss or damage caused by the ship, or by a fault of the navigation of the ship in the same manner as the owner would be if pilotage were not compulsory: s 410B(2) of the Navigation Act 1912 (Cth) and/or the Queensland equivalent provision, s 102 of the Transport Operations (Maritime Safety) Act 1994 (Qld). In this regard, see Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 ; (2005) 148 FCR 68. Using plain language, to the extent (as it does) that the claim against the defendant is based on assertions that the pilot was at fault, it is a claim in respect of the pilotage that was carried out by the pilot. The claim can be directed at the ship because it is a claim against the relevant person who is asserted to be responsible by law for the pilot's default. The direction of the claim against the defendant does not make the claim any less in respect of the pilotage of the ship that was undertaken, than it would have been if made against the pilot personally.

95 As to towage, subject to the concept of towage extending to the activities of the tug here, all the above would support the conclusion that this is a claim in respect of the towage of Global Peace .</text>

<text>96 Towage is not merely (though it includes) the assistance given to one vessel (the tow) by another (the tug) to move through the water by pulling on a rope or hawser linking tug and tow. It can be seen also to include any operation in connection with the holding, pushing, pulling, moving, escorting or guiding of or standing by a vessel: Burrard Towing Co v Reed Stenhouse Ltd (1996) 19 BCLR (3d) 391 referring to the United Kingdom Standard Conditions for Towage.</text>

<text>104 "Navigation" is a word capable of wide meaning. It is used, sometimes in the phrase "navigation or management", in a number of maritime contexts, including article IV of the Hague Rules and Hague-Visby Rules dealing with the distinction between care of cargo and navigation or management of the ship. It has been said that a ship need not be in a state of motion to be in a state of navigation: Hayn v Culliford (1878) 3 CPD 410 at 417. One definition is the science or art of conducting a ship from place to place through the water: The 'Warkworth' (1884) 9 PD 145 at 148. However the word is apt to encompass, if the context permits, the controlled movement of a ship to berth with the assistance of tugs: see generally The 'Lord' v Newsum Sons &amp; Co [1920] 1 KB 846 at 849; Cyber Sea Technologies Inc v Underwater Harvester Remotely Operated Vehicle Serial (2000) 1 FC 569 at [6] and [7]; Good v The London Steamship Owners' Mutual Protecting Association (1871) LR 6 CP 563 at 569; Whistler International Limited v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [2001] 1 AC 638 at 643-44; The 'Glenochil' [1896] P 10 at 15-16; City of Charleroy v Bittern (1923) 14 Ll L Rep 302; The 'Mac' (1882) 7 PD 126 at 130; The 'Harlow' [1922] P 175 at 181; and The 'Champion' [1932] P1 at 10 and 15-16.

<tocase>Currie v McKnight [1897] AC 97</tocase>
<text>86 The early cases such as The 'Vera Cruz' (No 2) (1884) 9 PD 96 and Currie v McKnight [1897] AC 97 appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument. Lord Diplock approved these cases in The 'Eschersheim' , but factually applied the phrase more broadly than perhaps was done in those cases. A similarly somewhat broader approach can also be found in The 'Industrie' (1871) LR 3 A &amp; E 303, The 'Chr Knudsen' [1932] P 153 and the The 'Minerva' [1933] P 224.

87 The need in the cases for the direct connection and for the ship to be somehow the instrument of the damage can be seen in Currie v McKnight where damage was caused to a ship by the crew of another ship cutting the mooring lines linking two ships in order to allow their ship to depart. The first ship, after the mooring lines were cut, was unable to get a head of steam up in time and was driven ashore. The court said that the damage to that ship was caused by the human acts of the crew of the other ship alone and not by the ship on which they were aboard when they cut the lines. This was so, even though what they did was in connection with the operation of taking that other ship to sea. One can see both closer notions of causation than perhaps are current today and the echo of the personification theory in the need for the ship itself to be the active or noxious instrument to be operative considerations see for instance Lord Halsbury LC in Currie v McKnight at 101:
 
 The phrase that it must be the fault of the ship itself is not a mere figurative expression, but it imports, in my opinion, that the ship against which a maritime lien for damages is claimed is the instrument of mischief, and that in order to establish the liability of the ship itself to the maritime lien claimed some act of navigation of the ship itself should either mediately or immediately be the cause of the damage.

<tocase>De Lovio v Boit 7 F.Cas 218 (1815)</tocase>
<text>49 This view had its roots in the seminal decision of Story J sitting as a Circuit Judge in De Lovio v Boit 7 F.Cas 218 (1815) in rejecting the view that had up to that point been expressed as to the linkage of the phrase "of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" in Article III section 2 of the United States Constitution to the character and content of English jurisdiction at the time of Independence: see for example United States v McGill 4 US 426 (1806) at 429-30 (Washington J sitting as a Circuit Judge). Nevertheless, as can be seen from all the judgments in the Federal Court and the High Court in The 'Shin Kobe Maru' , the discerned width and scope of s 76(iii) was a product of the liberal construction of a provision of the Australian Constitution , though set against a context of the recognised international character of the jurisdiction amongst maritime nations of the world as incorporated in the United States Constitution , from which source (Article III Section 2) the words of s 76(iii) were taken.

50 The rich international character of the jurisdiction can be seen in the expression of the scope of the jurisdiction by Story J in De Lovio v Boit at 442-43:
 
 The clause however of the Constitution not only confers Admiralty jurisdiction, but the word `maritime' is superadded, seemingly ex industria, to remove every latent doubt. `Cases of maritime jurisdiction' must include all maritime contracts, torts and injuries, which are in the understanding of the common law, as well as of the Admiralty, `causae civiles et maritimae'. In this view there is a peculiar propriety in the incorporation of the term `maritime' into the Constitution . The disputes and discussions, respecting what the Admiralty jurisdiction was, could not but be well known to the framers of that instrument ... One party sought to limit it by locality; another by the subject matter. It was wise, therefore, to dissipate all question by giving cognisance of all `cases of maritime jurisdiction', or, what is precisely equivalent, of all maritime cases. Upon any other construction, the word `maritime' would be mere tautology; but in this sense it has a peculiar and appropriate force ... The language of the constitution will therefore warrant the most liberal interpretation; and it may not be unfit to hold, that it had reference to that maritime jurisdiction, which commercial convenience, public policy, and national rights, have contributed to establish, with slight local differences, over all Europe; that jurisdiction, which under the name of consular courts, first established itself upon the shores of the Mediterranean, and, from the general equity and simplicity of its proceedings, soon commended itself to all the maritime states; that jurisdiction, in short, which collecting the wisdom of the civil law, and combining it with the customs and usages of the sea, produced the venerable Consolato del Mare, and still continues in its decisions to regulate the commerce, the intercourse and the warfare of mankind. 
 
 ... 
 
 At all events, there is no solid reason for construing the terms of the Constitution in a narrow and limited sense, or for ingrafting upon them the restrictions of English statutes, or decisions at common law founded on those statutes, which were sometimes dictated by jealousy, and sometimes by misapprehension, which are often contradictory, and rarely supported by any consistent principle. The advantages resulting to the commerce and navigation of the United States, from a uniformity of rules and decisions in all maritime questions, authorise us to believe that national policy, as well as juridical logic, require the clause of the Constitution to be so construed as to embrace all maritime contracts, torts and injuries, or, in other words, to embrace all those causes, which originally and inherently belonged to the Admiralty, before any statutable restriction.

57 It will be necessary to return to aspects of s 4. For present purposes, it is only necessary to emphasise that it was not intended that the closed lists in s 4(2) and (3) would exhaust the scope of s 76(iii). Rather, the lists of claims were those which, conformably with the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Arrest of Sea-Going Ships done at Brussels on 10 May 1952 (the "1952 Arrest Convention") and with comparative international admiralty practice of major trading partners, were seen to be appropriate to found the procedure central to Admiralty practice, the action in rem, and the consequential availability of arrest. (For instance, there would seem little doubt that one class of maritime contracts concerned with maritime commerce is marine insurance. Indeed, De Lovio v Boit itself is authority for the proposition, never doubted thereafter in the United States, that a policy of marine insurance is a maritime contract and therefore "of admiralty jurisdiction". Claims concerning disputes about marine insurance claims are not, however (with the exception of premiums or calls in s 4(3)(s) of the Act) general maritime claims.)

58 It is also important to understand the international or world-wide nature of the reach of the Act effected by s 5 which is in the following terms:
 
 (1) Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, this Act applies in relation to: 
 (a) all ships, irrespective of the places of residence or domicile of their owners; and 
 (b) all maritime claims, wherever arising. 
 (2) This Act does not apply in relation to a proceeding commenced before the commencement of this Act. 
 (3) This Act does not apply in relation to a cause of action that arose: 
 (a) in respect of an inland waterways vessel; or 
 (b) in respect of the use or intended use of a ship on inland waters. 
 (4) Paragraph (3)(b) does not have effect in relation to a cause of action if, at the time when the cause of action arose, the ship concerned was a foreign ship.

59 Section 12 of the Act deals with "associated jurisdiction". It is in the following terms:
 
 The jurisdiction that a court has under this Act extends to jurisdiction in respect of a matter of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction not otherwise within its jurisdiction that is associated with a matter in which the jurisdiction of the court under this Act is invoked.</text>

<text>130 For the reasons that I have identified, it is unnecessary to decide either of these questions. Given the restrictive approach to maritime liens in Anglo-Australian law, there are significant obstacles in the way of the first question, being an argument that a new class of maritime lien should be recognised: see for example, The 'Acrux' , The 'Halcyon Isle' [1981] AC 221; and Fournier v The Ship 'Margaret Z' [1999] 3 NZLR 111 [22]-[23].</text>

<tocase>Good v The London Steamship Owners' Mutual Protecting Association (1871) LR 6 CP 563</tocase>
<text>102 The plaintiff says that the claim is one arising out of the act or omission of a person (being the person in charge of the tug) for whose wrongful acts or omissions the owner of Global Peace is liable. This way of putting the claim invokes s 4(3)(d)(iii). The plaintiff also says that the claim is one arising out of an act or omission of the owner (through the asserted default of the master), thereby invoking s 4(3)(d)(i). This much can be accepted. However, more is required. The act or omission must be in the navigation or management of the ship .

103 In the present context, the general maritime claim must concern the ship for the purposes of s 17. The ship for s 17 is the same ship as for s 4(3)(d). However, whilst it is undoubted that the act or omission (as asserted) of the tugmaster was an act or omission in the navigation or management of the tug, that does not mean that it was not also in the navigation or management of the tow, Global Peace. If the events (as asserted) occurred in the towage operation, it can be said that the acts or omissions took place in the navigation or management of Global Peace as well as of Tom Tough. This arises out of the nature of the towage operation: the tug is in the course of navigation and its operation is effecting or is part of the navigation or management of Global Peace.

104 "Navigation" is a word capable of wide meaning. It is used, sometimes in the phrase "navigation or management", in a number of maritime contexts, including article IV of the Hague Rules and Hague-Visby Rules dealing with the distinction between care of cargo and navigation or management of the ship. It has been said that a ship need not be in a state of motion to be in a state of navigation: Hayn v Culliford (1878) 3 CPD 410 at 417. One definition is the science or art of conducting a ship from place to place through the water: The 'Warkworth' (1884) 9 PD 145 at 148. However the word is apt to encompass, if the context permits, the controlled movement of a ship to berth with the assistance of tugs: see generally The 'Lord' v Newsum Sons &amp; Co [1920] 1 KB 846 at 849; Cyber Sea Technologies Inc v Underwater Harvester Remotely Operated Vehicle Serial (2000) 1 FC 569 at [6] and [7]; Good v The London Steamship Owners' Mutual Protecting Association (1871) LR 6 CP 563 at 569; Whistler International Limited v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [2001] 1 AC 638 at 643-44; The 'Glenochil' [1896] P 10 at 15-16; City of Charleroy v Bittern (1923) 14 Ll L Rep 302; The 'Mac' (1882) 7 PD 126 at 130; The 'Harlow' [1922] P 175 at 181; and The 'Champion' [1932] P1 at 10 and 15-16.

<tocase>Nagrint v The Ship 'Regis' [1939] HCA 6 ; (1939) 61 CLR 688</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1939/6.html</AustLII>
<text>84 In Nagrint v The Ship 'Regis' [1939] HCA 6 ; (1939) 61 CLR 688 at 698, Dixon J commented on the artificiality of the distinction based on the need for the ship to be an active agent, but recognised the importance of it in the jurisprudence: see the discussion of the cases at 698-700. A helpful passage is at 700:
 
 It is true that these cases are no more than illustrations of the manner in which the test has been applied. But they show that when the injury arises from some defect in the condition of the ship considered as premises or as a structure upon which the person injured is standing, walking or moving, the ship is treated as no more than a potential danger of a passive kind, a danger to the user, whose use is the active cause of the injury. But where the injury is the result of the management or navigation of the ship as a moving object or of the working of the gear or of some other operation, then the damage is to be regarded as done by the ship as an active agent or as the "noxious instrument." 
 
 In the present case, according to the allegations, the improper navigation of the ship caused her so to behave that she capsized. Her behaviour as an active agent was the direct cause of the harm, and in that sense she was the noxious instrument.

88 What then is claimed here? One goes to the statement of claim which supports the amended writ. The oil came from Global Peace . The defendant says that it was the ship's bunker fuel. That can be seen for various purposes, including the operation of the arrest provisions to be part of the ship: Scandinavian Bunkering AS v The Bunkers on Board the Ship FV 'Taruman' [2006] FCAFC 75. It is alleged that those in charge of Global Peace , the pilot and master, failed in their duties in the navigation or management of the ship, in respect of its handling in the berthing operation. It is also alleged that those in charge of the tug were negligent for which the owner of Global peace was responsible. The propositions by way of assertions are that the ship was mishandled by, in part, those on board the ship. Thus, if these allegations are made good Medi Vitoria has had her hull fouled by the oil that has escaped from Global Peace by, in part, the faulty navigation or management or handling of Global Peace in manoeuvring the ship in the berthing operation. To paraphrase the words of Dixon J in Nagrint v The Ship 'Regis' at 200, the injury to Medi Vitoria is claimed to be the result of the navigation or management of Global Peace as a moving object in her berthing or some other operation in her berthing.</text>

<text>47 In Owners of 'Shin Kobe Maru' v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 ( The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (HC)), the High Court, in a unanimous joint judgment, made clear the broad Constitutional scope of s 76(iii). It was not limited by English and colonial history; it was not tied to the state of Admiralty jurisdiction in England or the local colonies as at 1900 or 1890. Rather, it was stated (at 424) that s 76(iii): 
 
 extends to matters of the kind generally accepted by maritime nations as falling within a special jurisdiction, sometimes called Admiralty and sometimes called maritime jurisdiction, concerned with the resolution of controversies relating to marine commerce and navigation.</text>

<text>131 The second question raises an important issue about the approach to s 15, and it is appropriate to say something about this. As a matter of construction of s 15 a number of considerations are relevant. First, the approach enunciated by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket and discussed in The Queen v Gray; Ex parte Marsh and The 'Tieng Sheng (No 8)' to which I have already referred must be borne in mind. Secondly, the word "includes" in s 15(2) reflects the fact that the Act leaves open the possibility of other maritime liens being recognised beyond those listed. This might occur by reference to the development of Australian maritime law in this respect, or by the recognition of foreign maritime liens by reference to principles of private international law different to those expressed by the majority of the Privy Council in The 'Halcyon Isle' ; and see Price, G The Law of Maritime Liens (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 1940) at Ch 20. The defendant submitted (as is the case) that s 6 of the Act provides that the Act does not have the effect of creating a new maritime lien, and that this assists the conclusion that the court should not extend the categories of maritime liens. That, however, was an approach to the formulation of the whole Act on the basis of the perceived limitation of the legislative power of the Commonwealth found in Owners of SS Kalibia v Wilson [1910] HCA 77 ; (1910) 11 CLR 689 to the effect that the Commonwealth Parliament does not have implied power to legislate for Admiralty and maritime substantive law. It is unnecessary and inappropriate to discuss whether The 'Kalibia' reflects the current Constitutional position given the emergence of Australia as a fully independent nation state: cf The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (FC) at 86-7; The 'Genessee Chief' 53 US 263 (1851); The 'Lottawanna' ; Butler v Boston and Savannah Steamship Co 130 US 527 (1889); In re Garnett 141 US 1 (1891); Southern Pacific Co v Jensen 244 US 205 (1917); Panama Railroad Co v Johnson 264 US 375 (1924); and Harrison Moore The Constitution of Australia at 562. It is sufficient to say that s 76(iii) provides for Parliament to confer or invest Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The absence (according to The 'Kalibia' ) of a coterminous legislative power to deal with substantive law matching the reach of judicial authority over Admiralty and maritime controversies does not limit the full import and implication of the grant of judicial power. The conferral of jurisdiction is not a matter of mere procedure. It is the conferral of a species of governmental power to quell controversies. Subject to limited circumstances that may exist by way of exception, courts have a duty to exercise the power if jurisdiction is invoked. Thus, judges have a responsibility to ascertain and declare the general maritime law of Australia, as part of the common law of Australia. If that includes ascertaining and declaring the law of maritime liens, that is part of the task.</text>

<tocase>Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7 ; (1938) 59 CLR 369</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/7.html</AustLII>
<text>73 This kind of distinction between a limitation relevant to the jurisdiction of a court which goes to the existence of jurisdiction (that is as a condition which must exist before authority to adjudicate arises) and which goes to the exercise of jurisdiction was discussed by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7 ; (1938) 59 CLR 369 at 391 as follows:
 
 It cannot be denied that, if the legislature see fit to do it, any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend. But, if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the court's opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed. 
 

See also The Queen v Gray: Ex parte Marsh [1985] HCA 67 ; (1985) 157 CLR 351 at 374-75 per Mason J (as he then was), and in an Admiralty context, see The 'Tian Sheng No 8' [2000] 2 Lloyd's Rep 430 at 443 per Sir Anthony Mason sitting in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.

119 Conformably with the approach described in Parisienne Basket , The Queen v Gray ; Ex parte Marsh and the The 'Tien Sheng No 8' these are questions which should be seen as to be resolved within jurisdiction, if the assertions made are that there is liability under the PS (CL) Act and the Pollution Convention.

120 Section 4(3)(b) of the Act should be read with ss 7 and 8 of the PS (CL) Act and the Pollution Convention. By doing so, I conclude that the claim described in s 4(3)(b) is to be characterised by the assertions made and not by reference to the evidence which would see the claim under the Pollution Convention succeed or fail.

121 Thus, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate this claim. It is another question, however, whether it should now be dismissed. Mr Street said that he wanted to cross-examine Mr White on this issue. I will hear the parties as to the proper conduct of the motion insofar as it seeks to dismiss this claim summarily.

131 The second question raises an important issue about the approach to s 15, and it is appropriate to say something about this. As a matter of construction of s 15 a number of considerations are relevant. First, the approach enunciated by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket and discussed in The Queen v Gray; Ex parte Marsh and The 'Tieng Sheng (No 8)' to which I have already referred must be borne in mind.

<text>60 In [193] to [195], [227] and [228] of the ALRC Report, there was discussion of both accrued jurisdiction and associated jurisdiction. Accrued jurisdiction is another way of referring to the whole of a matter or controversy beyond the element of identifiably federal law: that is, apparently otherwise non-federal elements which are part of the one controversy which, for a reason or reasons having its or their source or sources in s 75 or s 76 of the Constitution , is in federal jurisdiction: see especially Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 and Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. Provisions such as s 12 of the Act and s 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) dealing with associated jurisdiction confer (or invest) jurisdiction in a matter which, by reference to ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , could be (but has not been) conferred (or invested), if it is "associated" with a matter in respect of which jurisdiction has been conferred (or invested) and which has been invoked. See generally Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions [1981] HCA 7 ; (1981) 148 CLR 457, PCS Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 153 ALR 520 and Zines Cowen and Zines's Federal Jurisdiction in Australia (Federation Press, 3 rd Ed 2003) at 148-49. For reasons that will become apparent, it is unnecessary to explore the relationship between accrued and associated jurisdiction any further, or to discuss the content of the relationship of matters which leads to a conclusion that they are "associated". It is, however, important to recognise that s 12 deals with associated matters of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction (and not other kinds of matters contemplated by s 75 or 76 of the Constitution ).</text>

<tocase>Polpen Shipping Co v Commercial Union Assurance Co Ltd [1943] 1 KB 151</tocase>
<text>104 "Navigation" is a word capable of wide meaning. It is used, sometimes in the phrase "navigation or management", in a number of maritime contexts, including article IV of the Hague Rules and Hague-Visby Rules dealing with the distinction between care of cargo and navigation or management of the ship. It has been said that a ship need not be in a state of motion to be in a state of navigation: Hayn v Culliford (1878) 3 CPD 410 at 417. One definition is the science or art of conducting a ship from place to place through the water: The 'Warkworth' (1884) 9 PD 145 at 148. However the word is apt to encompass, if the context permits, the controlled movement of a ship to berth with the assistance of tugs: see generally The 'Lord' v Newsum Sons &amp; Co [1920] 1 KB 846 at 849; Cyber Sea Technologies Inc v Underwater Harvester Remotely Operated Vehicle Serial (2000) 1 FC 569 at [6] and [7]; Good v The London Steamship Owners' Mutual Protecting Association (1871) LR 6 CP 563 at 569; Whistler International Limited v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [2001] 1 AC 638 at 643-44; The 'Glenochil' [1896] P 10 at 15-16; City of Charleroy v Bittern (1923) 14 Ll L Rep 302; The 'Mac' (1882) 7 PD 126 at 130; The 'Harlow' [1922] P 175 at 181; and The 'Champion' [1932] P1 at 10 and 15-16. Some cases require the planned or ordered movement from one place to another: see Polpen Shipping Co v Commercial Union Assurance Co Ltd [1943] 1 KB 161 at 167 and Steedman v Scofield [1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 163 .</text>

<tocase>The 'Acrux' [1965] P 391</tocase>
<text>76 Whether or not a claim bears the requisite legal character in any given case may not be straightforward. In a number of cases the courts have examined the assertions made in, and facts proven in relation to, the writ and accompanying documents to answer the question whether the claim, as made, answers the description of the words of the relevant paragraph as an appropriate enquiry as to the jurisdiction of the court: see, for example, The 'Bass Reefer', The 'Acrux' [1965] P 391 ; and The 'Antonis P Lemos' [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 310. How, in any given case, the plaintiff chooses to discharge the responsibility on it to satisfy the court of the jurisdiction of the court is a matter for it. The plaintiff may choose to lead evidence of the underlying claim. But it should always be borne in mind that it is the claim, that is the relevant assertions, that must bear the requisite legal character. Care should be taken not to invest this task with a function or requirement of proving the claim at some prefatory level or to some preliminary standard of satisfaction. To do so would raise difficulties of a character similar, indeed related to, those that Willmer J saw posed by the defendant's unsuccessful argument in The 'St Elefterio' [1957] P 179 at 185-87.

130 For the reasons that I have identified, it is unnecessary to decide either of these questions. Given the restrictive approach to maritime liens in Anglo-Australian law, there are significant obstacles in the way of the first question, being an argument that a new class of maritime lien should be recognised: see for example, The 'Acrux' , The 'Halcyon Isle' [1981] AC 221; and Fournier v The Ship 'Margaret Z' [1999] 3 NZLR 111 [22]-[23].

135 This approach accords with comparative practice in other jurisdictions: see for example, The 'Acrux' and The 'St Merriel' [1963] P 247.</text>

<text>76 Whether or not a claim bears the requisite legal character in any given case may not be straightforward. In a number of cases the courts have examined the assertions made in, and facts proven in relation to, the writ and accompanying documents to answer the question whether the claim, as made, answers the description of the words of the relevant paragraph as an appropriate enquiry as to the jurisdiction of the court: see, for example, The 'Bass Reefer', The 'Acrux' [1965] P 391 ; and The 'Antonis P Lemos' [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 310. How, in any given case, the plaintiff chooses to discharge the responsibility on it to satisfy the court of the jurisdiction of the court is a matter for it. The plaintiff may choose to lead evidence of the underlying claim. But it should always be borne in mind that it is the claim, that is the relevant assertions, that must bear the requisite legal character. Care should be taken not to invest this task with a function or requirement of proving the claim at some prefatory level or to some preliminary standard of satisfaction. To do so would raise difficulties of a character similar, indeed related to, those that Willmer J saw posed by the defendant's unsuccessful argument in The 'St Elefterio' [1957] P 179 at 185-87.</text>

<tocase>The 'Eschersheim' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 1</tocase>
<text>82 A convenient description of the phrase and its contents can be taken from the judgment of Lord Diplock (in whose reasons all members of the House of Lords concurred) in The 'Eschersheim' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 1 at 8:
 
 The figurative phrase "damage done by a ship" is a term of art in maritime law whose meaning is well settled by authority: see The Vera Cruz (1884) 9 P.D. 96; Currie v. M'Knight, [1897] A.C. 97. To fall within the phrase not only must the damage be the direct result or natural consequence of something done by those engaged in the navigation of the ship but the ship itself must be the actual instrument by which the damage was done. The commonest case is that of collision, which is specifically mentioned in the convention: but physical contact between the ship and whatever object sustains the damage is not essential-a ship may negligently cause a wash by which some other vessel or some property on shore is damaged.

83 In The ' Eschersheim ' there was a challenge to jurisdiction and a stay application. The tug Rotesand took in tow the ship Erkowit, which had been holed in a collision with a third vessel. A salvage agreement was signed between those on Rotesand and Erkowit's master. The tug beached Erkowit in a sinking condition. No particular damage to Erkowit or her cargo was caused by the beaching, but extensive pollution damage later occurred to surrounding areas from oil in Erkowit , and the cargo and the crew's possessions on Erkowit were later damaged and lost. The claims were against the salvors for negligent salvage. The owners claimed for loss of the ship; the master, crew and cargo owners claimed for the loss of possessions and cargo. Brandon J at first instance said the claims thus made were not for damage done by a ship, that is Rotesand ; the Court of Appeal disagreed. The House of Lords agreed with the Court of Appeal. The following parts of Lord Diplock's judgment at 8 reveal the fineness of the distinctions involved and the difficulty of resolving these issues entirely satisfactorily on a motion about jurisdiction by reference to the "character" of the claim:
 
 In the instant case the act of casting off the Erkowit in such a way as to beach her upon an exposed shore was something done by those engaged in the navigation of the Rotesand, as a result of which the Erkowit and her cargo were left exposed to the risk of being damaged by wind and wave if the weather worsened before she could be removed to a more sheltered position. 
 
 I do not understand it to be claimed that the actual beaching caused any physical damage to ship or cargo, but for the purposes of this appeal it must be assumed that the chain of causation is unbroken between the beaching of the Erkowit and her subsequent breaking-up by wind and wave. Had the damage been caused by the beaching, there could in my view have been no question but that the Rotesand could properly be regarded as the actual instrument by which that damage was done. Although for my part I find this a borderline case, I do not think that the intervening failure of the appellants to take steps to avert the risk of damage, which forms the subject of the alternative grounds of negligence, prevents the Rotesand from remaining the actual instrument by which the damage subsequent to the beaching was done. I accordingly agree with the Court of Appeal that the shipowners' and cargo-owners' claims also fall under par. (d) of s. 1(1).

85 In The 'Rama' [1996] 2 Lloyd's Rep 281, Clarke J discussed The 'Eschersheim' and concluded at 293 that to be "damage done by a ship" three criteria must be satisfied:
 
 (a) the damage must be caused by something done by those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship in a physical sense; (b) the ship must be the actual or noxious instrument by which the damage is done; and (c) the damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship.

86 The early cases such as The 'Vera Cruz' (No 2) (1884) 9 PD 96 and Currie v McKnight [1897] AC 97 appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument. Lord Diplock approved these cases in The 'Eschersheim' , but factually applied the phrase more broadly than perhaps was done in those cases. A similarly somewhat broader approach can also be found in The 'Industrie' (1871) LR 3 A &amp; E 303, The 'Chr Knudsen' [1932] P 153 and the The 'Minerva' [1933] P 224.</text>

<tocase>The 'Halcyon Isle' [1981] AC 221</tocase>
<text>130 For the reasons that I have identified, it is unnecessary to decide either of these questions. Given the restrictive approach to maritime liens in Anglo-Australian law, there are significant obstacles in the way of the first question, being an argument that a new class of maritime lien should be recognised: see for example, The 'Acrux' , The 'Halcyon Isle' [1981] AC 221; and Fournier v The Ship 'Margaret Z' [1999] 3 NZLR 111 [22]-[23].

131 The second question raises an important issue about the approach to s 15, and it is appropriate to say something about this. As a matter of construction of s 15 a number of considerations are relevant. First, the approach enunciated by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket and discussed in The Queen v Gray; Ex parte Marsh and The 'Tieng Sheng (No 8)' to which I have already referred must be borne in mind. Secondly, the word "includes" in s 15(2) reflects the fact that the Act leaves open the possibility of other maritime liens being recognised beyond those listed. This might occur by reference to the development of Australian maritime law in this respect, or by the recognition of foreign maritime liens by reference to principles of private international law different to those expressed by the majority of the Privy Council in The 'Halcyon Isle' ; and see Price, G The Law of Maritime Liens (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 1940) at Ch 20. The defendant submitted (as is the case) that s 6 of the Act provides that the Act does not have the effect of creating a new maritime lien, and that this assists the conclusion that the court should not extend the categories of maritime liens. That, however, was an approach to the formulation of the whole Act on the basis of the perceived limitation of the legislative power of the Commonwealth found in Owners of SS Kalibia v Wilson [1910] HCA 77 ; (1910) 11 CLR 689 to the effect that the Commonwealth Parliament does not have implied power to legislate for Admiralty and maritime substantive law. It is unnecessary and inappropriate to discuss whether The 'Kalibia' reflects the current Constitutional position given the emergence of Australia as a fully independent nation state: cf The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (FC) at 86-7; The 'Genessee Chief' 53 US 263 (1851); The 'Lottawanna' ; Butler v Boston and Savannah Steamship Co 130 US 527 (1889); In re Garnett 141 US 1 (1891); Southern Pacific Co v Jensen 244 US 205 (1917); Panama Railroad Co v Johnson 264 US 375 (1924); and Harrison Moore The Constitution of Australia at 562. It is sufficient to say that s 76(iii) provides for Parliament to confer or invest Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The absence (according to The 'Kalibia' ) of a coterminous legislative power to deal with substantive law matching the reach of judicial authority over Admiralty and maritime controversies does not limit the full import and implication of the grant of judicial power. The conferral of jurisdiction is not a matter of mere procedure. It is the conferral of a species of governmental power to quell controversies. Subject to limited circumstances that may exist by way of exception, courts have a duty to exercise the power if jurisdiction is invoked. Thus, judges have a responsibility to ascertain and declare the general maritime law of Australia, as part of the common law of Australia. If that includes ascertaining and declaring the law of maritime liens, that is part of the task.</text>

As Benedict on Admiralty (5 th Ed, Banks &amp; Co 1925) said at 166 [100]:
 
 Countless vessels, such as barges and canal boats, have no motive power of their own and are built with a view to receiving their propelling force from other sources. Other vessels with motive power of their own yet employ auxiliary power to hasten their progress or to assist in working about harbours or into docks. To supply such power to another vessel is towage and the towage contract is in all its features within the cognizance of the admiralty for such a contract is in its nature maritime.

To do so would raise difficulties of a character similar, indeed related to, those that Willmer J saw posed by the defendant's unsuccessful argument in The 'St Elefterio' [1957] P 179 at 185-87.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/210.html</AustLII>
<text>92 Recalling that such a provision conferring jurisdiction on a superior court is to be interpreted liberally and without imposing or reading in limitations not found in the express words, what do these paragraphs mean? The words "in respect of" provide for a wide relational connection and should be given their ordinary broad meaning: The 'Sydney Sunset' [2001] FCA 210 at [12] per Tamberlin J which was applied by Belinda Ang JC in The 'Alexandrea' [2002] 3 SLR 56 at 61 [25] and [26]; The Kommunar' [1997] 1 Lloyd's Rep 1 at 5; and The 'Edinburgh Castle' [1999] 2 Lloyds Rep 362 and 363. The phrase has been said to "have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connexion or relation between the two subject matters to which the words refer": Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co Ltd v Reilly [1941] VLR 110 at 111, cited in State Government Insurance Office (Qld) v Crittenden [1966] HCA 56 ; (1966) 117 CLR 412 at 416. However, of course, the meaning of the phrase, in any given case, is to be derived substantially from context: State Government Insurance Office (Qld) v Rees [1979] HCA 52 ; (1979) 144 CLR 549 at 561 and Workers Compensation Board (Qld) v Technical Products Pty Ltd [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642 at 646-47.</text>

<text>73 This kind of distinction between a limitation relevant to the jurisdiction of a court which goes to the existence of jurisdiction (that is as a condition which must exist before authority to adjudicate arises) and which goes to the exercise of jurisdiction was discussed by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7 ; (1938) 59 CLR 369 at 391 as follows:
 
 It cannot be denied that, if the legislature see fit to do it, any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend. But, if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the court's opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed.

<text>86 The early cases such as The 'Vera Cruz' (No 2) (1884) 9 PD 96 and Currie v McKnight [1897] AC 97 appear on their own facts to require a close and direct connection between the damage and the ship as an instrument. Lord Diplock approved these cases in The 'Eschersheim' , but factually applied the phrase more broadly than perhaps was done in those cases. A similarly somewhat broader approach can also be found in The 'Industrie' (1871) LR 3 A &amp; E 303, The 'Chr Knudsen' [1932] P 153 and the The 'Minerva' [1933] P 224.</text>

<tocase>The 'Warkworth' (1884) 9 PD 145</tocase>
<text>104 "Navigation" is a word capable of wide meaning. It is used, sometimes in the phrase "navigation or management", in a number of maritime contexts, including article IV of the Hague Rules and Hague-Visby Rules dealing with the distinction between care of cargo and navigation or management of the ship. It has been said that a ship need not be in a state of motion to be in a state of navigation: Hayn v Culliford (1878) 3 CPD 410 at 417. One definition is the science or art of conducting a ship from place to place through the water: The 'Warkworth' (1884) 9 PD 145 at 148. However the word is apt to encompass, if the context permits, the controlled movement of a ship to berth with the assistance of tugs: see generally The 'Lord' v Newsum Sons &amp; Co [1920] 1 KB 846 at 849; Cyber Sea Technologies Inc v Underwater Harvester Remotely Operated Vehicle Serial (2000) 1 FC 569 at [6] and [7]; Good v The London Steamship Owners' Mutual Protecting Association (1871) LR 6 CP 563 at 569; Whistler International Limited v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [2001] 1 AC 638 at 643-44; The 'Glenochil' [1896] P 10 at 15-16; City of Charleroy v Bittern (1923) 14 Ll L Rep 302; The 'Mac' (1882) 7 PD 126 at 130; The 'Harlow' [1922] P 175 at 181; and The 'Champion' [1932] P1 at 10 and 15-16. Some cases require the planned or ordered movement from one place to another: see Polpen Shipping Co v Commercial Union Assurance Co Ltd [1943] 1 KB 161 at 167 and Steedman v Scofield [1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 163 .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/68.html</AustLII>
<text>74 In Tisand Pty Ltd v the Owners of the Ship MV Cape Moreton (Ex Freya) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 143 FCR 43, the Full Court discussed the approach to interpretation of the Act at [59] to [65]. I need not set out those passages here. To those comments, only two matters need be added for emphasis, for the purposes of this case. First, provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court should be interpreted liberally and without imposing limitations not found in the express words: The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (HC) at 421. Secondly, a particular aspect of the importance of the context provided by the ALRC Report (otherwise discussed in The 'Cape Moreton' above) is the consideration referred to by the High Court in The 'Iran Amanat' at 138, as follows:
 
 The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of English legislation and authority set out above, the definition of "relevant person" should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts had given to the corresponding words in the English statute. When the Parliament has enacted legislation, affecting the subject of international shipping, and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then received a settled construction, there is every reason to construe the statutory language in the same way in this country unless such construction is unreasonable or inapplicable to Australian circumstances.</text>

<tocase>The 'Moschanthy' [1971] 1 Lloyd's Rep 37</tocase>
<text>75 As the High Court said in The 'Shin Kobe Maru' the question is whether a claim made bears a certain legal character. The High Court in that case also said (at 422) that the word "claim":
 
 ...would ordinarily be construed as the assertion of a right or interest recognized by the law and carrying an entitlement to relief. 
 

This analysis must be undertaken "by reference to the nature of the plaintiff's case as put forward, without reference to ... whether it is likely to succeed or not": The 'Moschanthy' [1971] 1 Lloyd's Rep 37 at 42. See also Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA [1996] 3 NZLR 641 at 647-48. Statements in some of the cases of the necessity to show some strength in the case before the jurisdiction of the court is attracted (that is before the court is legitimately seized of authority to adjudicate) appear impermissibly to combine the attraction of jurisdiction with its exercise: cf The 'Bass Reefer' (1992) 37 FCR 375. See generally, Toh, KS Admiralty Law and Practice (Butterworths Asia, 1998) p 40 and the cases there discussed.</text>

<tocase>Westpac Banking Corporation v Paterson (2001) 187 ALR 168</tocase>
<text>124 Here, by the time the question is to be assessed (the hearing of the motion) the proceeding was constituted by the amended writ, the application to further amend the writ and the statement of claim. The jurisdiction of the court is not to be assessed frozen at an anterior point of time: Westpac Banking Corporation v Paterson (2001) 187 ALR 168. Whilst the authority given in s 15 is to commence a proceeding, it is legitimate (at least so long as there is no fundamental change in the identity of the claim in the proceeding, as there is not here in any of the amendments) to have regard to documents (such as the statement of claim) filed after the commencement of the proceeding which illuminate its nature and character.

125 Here, the plaintiff's claim is that there is a maritime lien arising from all the circumstances pleaded: see [31] of the statement of claim. These circumstances include an assertion that there has been damage done by a ship. This, of course, is a recognised basis of a lien: s 15(2)(b).

126 Though [1] of the amended writ has an ambiguity arising from the second half of the paragraph, reading the amended writ and statement of claim together, the assertions therein amount to a proceeding on a maritime lien for damage done by a ship. Once this conclusion is drawn the Court has authority to hear the proceeding.</text>
