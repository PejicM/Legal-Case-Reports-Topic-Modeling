<tocase>Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65</tocase>
<text>5 The Court has the power to grant a stay in its discretion pursuant to O 52 r 17 of the Federal Courts Rules. The principles governing applications for a stay are settled. It is sufficient for the respondent to demonstrate that there is a reason or it is an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the discretion: see Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66.

6 The prima facie assumption is that the judgment appealed from is correct and the Court should not deprive a litigant of the benefit of a judgment in its favour. Counsel for the Union relied on this and opposed the grant of a stay upon the basis, first, that the appeal disclosed no arguable ground of appeal, alternatively, the prospects of success were weak; secondly, Ms Chester said all but three of the employees had indicated that they would repay the money if called upon to do so pursuant to a judgment of the Court on appeal; and, thirdly, the evidence for Prestige did not rise above speculation as to the difficulty of recovery.

7 According to counsel for Prestige, it proposed to challenge the judgment under appeal on two bases, first, that as a matter of construction the Victorian Arts Centre is not a premise of a state government instrumentality for the purposes of the relevant industrial awards in the ordinary sense of those words; and, secondly, as understood in context, having regard to relevant history, it was not such an instrumentality.</text>
