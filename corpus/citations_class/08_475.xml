<text>71 The Statement of Claim pleads that Excom breached its employment contract with Mr Patankar by failing to assist him to achieve his potential and goals as provided for by cl 24 of the offer of employment. It is not clear that this claim was pressed. In my view it is clear that the opening words of cl 24 of the terms and conditions upon which Mr Patankar was offered employment by Excom were aspirational in the sense that they merely sought to describe the attitude that would inform the way in which Excom would conduct staff performance reviews ( Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 ; Bishop v Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518). The meaning of the words is insufficiently certain to be enforced. They were not, in my view, intended of themselves to give rise to any legal obligation.</text>
