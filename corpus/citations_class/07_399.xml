<text>1 This is an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the appellants' protection visas. The appellants are brother and sister. They are Indonesian citizens of Chinese origin and Christians. They claimed a well-founded fear of persecution in Indonesia on the grounds of their race and religion. Details of their claims and the Tribunal's consideration of their claims are set out fully in the decision of the Federal Magistrates' Court: SZIYV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1621.

2 Their grounds of review before the magistrate were as follows:
 
 1. They were denied procedural fairness in connection with the making of the decision.
 2. That a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision.

3. They feared returning to Indonesian because they were ethnic Chinese and Christians.</text>
