<text>5 I note that in the recent decision of Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 , the High Court declared s 486A of the Migration Act invalid. Section 486A purports to impose time limits on the High Court's jurisdiction to entertain applications for review in much the same way as s 477 applies to the Federal Magistrates Court. The High Court declared s 486A invalid on the basis that it impermissibly limits the right of applicants to seek relief, in the form of constitutional writs, under s 75(v) of the Constitution . In my opinion, this decision does not bring the validity of s 477 into doubt. The Federal Magistrates Court obtains its jurisdiction from statute rather than the Constitution . If the legislature wishes to confine that jurisdiction it is entitled to do so (see SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 at [45] - [47] and Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 at [43] ).</text>
