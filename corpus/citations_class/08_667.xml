<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/56.html</AustLII>
<text>When delivering judgment in the principal proceeding in which I dismissed Mr Duncan's application: see Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2008] FCA 56 ; (2008) 100 ALD 292 ; I ventured to suggest that this may be an appropriate matter in which to make no order as to costs. Nonetheless I invited submissions on costs. Needless to say each party sought a costs order. Mr Duncan relies upon what he contends was Centrelink's demonstrated "disdain for the law" although, as the costs of his pro bono counsel are not being sought, any costs order in his favour would in any event be limited to out-of-pocket expenses: see Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14 ; (1994) 179 CLR 403 ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2003) [7.24] ff. Centrelink's claimed entitlement to a costs award was founded upon the principle that, ordinarily, costs follow the event. It contends that it did not unreasonably provoke the litigation: cf Cummings v Lewis (unreported, Wilcox J, 29 May 1992); the defensive postures it took, though unsuccessful in some degree, were not unreasonable: Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166 at 169; and the applicant was wholly unsuccessful.</text>

<tocase>Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4</tocase>
<text>The principles that inform the exercise of the Court's discretion to award costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) are well accepted. That discretion is absolute and unfettered but must be exercised judicially and cannot be exercised on grounds unconnected with the litigation: see Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 727 at 732. Neither can the power to award costs be used to punish either a successful or an unsuccessful party: cf Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 566-567.</text>

<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (2001) 115 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>Equally well accepted are the principles informing the proper exercise of the s 43 discretion. These are: 
 
 (i) ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order; 
 

 
 
 (ii) where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed; and 
 

 
 
 (iii) a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties' costs of them. In this sense 'issue' does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or law.

<tocase>Perrett v Commissioner for Superannuation (1991) 29 FCR 581</tocase>
<text>Notwithstanding the ordinary principle of costs following the event, there are two considerations of potentially present relevance of which account properly can be taken in justification of a departure from that principle. These are the reasonableness of the applicant in bringing the application and where the respondent, as in this case, is a public authority, the general importance both of the clarification of the law for such an authority and of securing proper compliance with it: see eg Perrett v Commissioner for Superannuation (1991) 29 FCR 581 at 594; see also Wilderness Society Inc v Hon Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for Environment and Water Resources [2008] FCAFC 19 at [7] .</text>
