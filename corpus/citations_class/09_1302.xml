<tocase>Abebe v The Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510</tocase>
<text>Finally in relation to this ground of appeal I note that it is for the appellant to make his case to the Tribunal, and not the reverse: Abebe v The Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576.

The third ground of appeal appears to be, to some extent, a variation of the first ground of appeal. In any event, however, it is clear that the Tribunal had provided the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present argument and give oral evidence in that, inter alia :

The appellant failed to appear before the Tribunal at the hearing scheduled on 19 February 2008, and the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it: s 426A. No jurisdictional error is identified by this ground of appeal.</text>

<text>I am also of the view that the subjective views of the Tribunal prior to the hearing as to defects, lack of detail or lack of specificity in evidence in the appellant's case do not constitute "information" within the meaning of s 424A(1) which needed to be communicated in writing to the appellant: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [24] , cf Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX [2009] HCA 31.</text>

<tocase>SZFDR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/35.html</AustLII>
<text>In relation to the appellant's claim that he had been advised poorly by his migration agent, the Federal Magistrate observed that it is well settled that bad or negligent advice or conduct by an agent which falls short of fraud is not alone sufficient to set aside the decision of the Tribunal: SZFDR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189.

The appellant's Grounds of Appeal pursuant to his Notice of Appeal filed 9 June 2009, are as follows : The Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") fell into jurisdictional error in that it denied procedural fairness to the appellant as well as acting in breach of its obligations under the law (in breach of section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 ). 
 Particulars
 The Tribunal did not provide the Applicant with the opportunity to respond to the lack of evidence regarding his application, as the Applicant could not sufficiently understand the language or the contents of the notification letter from the Tribunal, thus also unable to respond to the Tribunals invitation, given the clearly significant language and cultural barriers. This deprived the Applicant of a fair opportunity to respond.
 2. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to disclose adverse findings.
 Particulars
 The Tribunal failed to disclose to the Applicant, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review and ensure that the Applicant fully understands the significance of the review and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review.
 3. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that it failed to provide adequate opportunity to present arguments and give oral evidence.
 Particulars
 The Tribunal had failed to provide the Applicant with an adequate opportunity to respond to the lack of evidence and present his arguments because the Tribunal was "unable to make a favourable decision based on the given materials alone". The letter was itself not in a language understandable by the Applicant which resulted in the Applicant being unable to respond fully and appropriately. As a result, the Applicant was unaware of the nature of the hearing and the consequences it bears on the effect of the decision to refuse his visa thus being deprived of the opportunity to arrive at that understanding to give oral evidence and present his arguments.

Before me both the appellant and the Minister were represented by counsel.</text>
