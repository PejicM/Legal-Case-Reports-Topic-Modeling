<tocase>Brierley v Dextran Pty Ltd (1990) 9 ACLC 30</tocase>
<text>38 There may also be an equitable set off available to the acquirer arising from a distribution, in the case of units, or payment of a dividend in the case of shares, such that the consideration paid at settlement is less than the cash sum in the Notice: Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto [2002] VSC 105 ; (2002) 5 VR 61 at [99] - [100] . See also Brierley v Dextran Pty Ltd (1990) 9 ACLC 30, although the adjustment at settlement there, arose not in equity or under any statutory provision but by reason of the terms of the offer referrable to accretions, accruing for whatever reason, directly or indirectly to the shares. The offer in that case was to acquire the shares, with accretions for a cash sum. Where the offerees prior to settlement received benefits by way of accretions to the shares (an interim dividend), there was a set-off available to the offeror to that extent. There was no issue as to what was the "cash sum", or whether the offer was for a "cash sum". The "cash sum" was $2.30 per share. The question was whether at settlement, the amount payable was the cash sum less the interim dividend paid on the shares to the offerees prior to settlement.

39 Capricorn was in similar vein. The cash sum offered in the notice of compulsory acquisition was $2 for each unit. The benefit of distributions undeclared at the time of a compulsory acquisition notice accrues to an acquirer under s 664A of the Act : Capricorn at [92]. The question in that case was whether at settlement the acquirer was liable to set off against the cash sum of $2 the amount of benefit by way of distributions paid to the offerees between the date of the notice of compulsory acquisition and settlement. Neither Brierley nor Capricorn , in my opinion, assists the construction of "cash sum".

60 I have had regard to the provisions of s 664B(2) and the cases of Brierley and Capricorn relied upon by Mitsui, but for reasons which I have already explained, these do not inform the meaning of "cash sum" in s 664C(1)(a) of the Act. Rather, they are concerned with the amounts paid in due course for the securities.

63 It is not sufficient that at some indeterminate date in the future, if at all, a determinate amount of money may be calculated as the "cash sum" for the purpose of the Notice. This is a different matter from any statutory adjustment under s 664B(2) or equitable or contractual set offs to be applied to the cash amount offered in a notice of compulsory acquisition: Brierley and Capricorn.</text>

<tocase>Cann's Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210</tocase>

<text>47 At p 480 Gibbs J stated (relevant page numbers included): 
 
 In a series of cases under the National Security (Prices) Regulations, this Court discussed the manner in which the power given by those regulations to fix prices might validly be exercised. It is enough to refer to King Gee Clothing Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 and Cann's Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210 . In King Gee Clothing Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth , Dixon J. said at p 197: 
 
 
"But it is another matter when the basis of the price, however clearly described, involves some matter which is not an ascertainable fact or figure but a matter of estimate, assessment, discretionary allocation, or apportionment, resulting in the attribution of an amount or figure as a matter of judgment. When that is done no certain objective standard is prescribed; it is not a calculation and the result is not a price fixed or a fixed price.
 
 In the same case, Williams J at p 208, repeated an earlier statement that "a bare power to 'fix' a price cannot be validly exercised without naming a money sum, or prescribing a certain standard by the application of which it can be calculated or ascertained definitely." In Cann's Pty. Ltd v The Commonwealth , Latham C.J. said at p 217 that where the prices are fixed by reference to a standard, "the standard must not be such that any element therein can be ascertained only by the exercise of discretion in apportionment, allotment, allocation or otherwise."

48 Gibbs J continued (p 481):
 
 A power given to one person to determine a value or fix a price will not be validly exercised by allowing another to exercise a wide and unreviewable discretion in determining that price, although the person upon whom the power is conferred may, instead of actually fixing a money sum himself, "lay down a method of finding it which will produce the same result whoever applies it, so long as he uses it correctly.": Cann's Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth at p 228.

50 Hanwha points to the same authorities in support of its submissions that "cash sum" means a specified or fixed amount of money, which is not subject to any condition or indeterminate adjustment. It conceded, as I said, that a formula or mechanism for arriving at the "cash sum" may be used but submitted that it must be one that can be calculated or ascertained definitely; King Gee Clothing Co Ltd v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 at p 208 per Williams J. It must be a "method which will produce the same result whoever applies it so long as he uses it correctly": Cann's Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210 at p 228.</text>

<text>38 There may also be an equitable set off available to the acquirer arising from a distribution, in the case of units, or payment of a dividend in the case of shares, such that the consideration paid at settlement is less than the cash sum in the Notice: Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto [2002] VSC 105 ; (2002) 5 VR 61 at [99] - [100] . See also Brierley v Dextran Pty Ltd (1990) 9 ACLC 30, although the adjustment at settlement there, arose not in equity or under any statutory provision but by reason of the terms of the offer referrable to accretions, accruing for whatever reason, directly or indirectly to the shares. The offer in that case was to acquire the shares, with accretions for a cash sum. Where the offerees prior to settlement received benefits by way of accretions to the shares (an interim dividend), there was a set-off available to the offeror to that extent. There was no issue as to what was the "cash sum", or whether the offer was for a "cash sum". The "cash sum" was $2.30 per share. The question was whether at settlement, the amount payable was the cash sum less the interim dividend paid on the shares to the offerees prior to settlement.

39 Capricorn was in similar vein. The cash sum offered in the notice of compulsory acquisition was $2 for each unit. The benefit of distributions undeclared at the time of a compulsory acquisition notice accrues to an acquirer under s 664A of the Act : Capricorn at [92]. The question in that case was whether at settlement the acquirer was liable to set off against the cash sum of $2 the amount of benefit by way of distributions paid to the offerees between the date of the notice of compulsory acquisition and settlement. Neither Brierley nor Capricorn , in my opinion, assists the construction of "cash sum".

60 I have had regard to the provisions of s 664B(2) and the cases of Brierley and Capricorn relied upon by Mitsui, but for reasons which I have already explained, these do not inform the meaning of "cash sum" in s 664C(1)(a) of the Act. Rather, they are concerned with the amounts paid in due course for the securities.

61 I have so concluded because where the Court is required to evaluate whether the terms set out in a notice of compulsory acquisition give a fair value for the securities, it must determine this at or about the date that the notice was lodged with ASIC and the notice was despatched to shareholders: Capricorn at [88]-[90]. This statutory evaluation by the Court necessarily requires that the "cash sum" be ascertainable as at the date of the notice. It would be an extraordinary result if this could be evaluated by the Court by reference to information not known or capable of being ascertained as at the date of the notice. Likewise the recipient of a notice of compulsory acquisition ought be able to calculate the definite cash sum in order, importantly, to decide whether or not to object.

62 A formula or mechanism which is incapable of ascertaining a precise dollar amount for each of the shares in question at or about the date of a notice of compulsory acquisition does not, in my opinion, constitute a "cash sum", within the meaning of s 664C(1)(a) of the Act.

63 It is not sufficient that at some indeterminate date in the future, if at all, a determinate amount of money may be calculated as the "cash sum" for the purpose of the Notice. This is a different matter from any statutory adjustment under s 664B(2) or equitable or contractual set offs to be applied to the cash amount offered in a notice of compulsory acquisition: Brierley and Capricorn.</text>

<tocase>Fraser Henliens Pty Ltd v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/49.html</AustLII>
<text>45 A creditors meeting had purported to fix the administration remuneration by approving specific sums of money for each of the first two weeks of the administration and prospectively approving further remuneration by reference to hourly rates set out in the creditors report subject to the committee of creditors reviewing and confirming the details of the remuneration claim. The hourly rates contained in the creditors' reports included a range of rates the administrators were entitled to charge for the same types of work. At [24] Finkelstein J said: 
 
 The second reason is that even if it be permissible to "fix" remuneration prospectively by reference to a rate or scale of charges, such as an hourly rate, which is open ended and has no upper limit (which is what the administrators argue) here the resolutions go far beyond that. The natural meaning of the word "fix" in the context of an entitlement to "such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of [creditors]" is, so it seems to me, to quantify that remuneration, that is to calculate or ascertain the amount of remuneration: Mayne v Jaques [1960] HCA 23 ; (1960) 101 CLR 169, 173, 174, 180. See also In re Gallard; Ex parte Harris [1892] 1 QB 532, 544. Thus, remuneration will be "fixed" if it is stated as a money sum, or is based on a formula which is capable of being applied according to some objective standard so the sum "can be calculated or ascertained definitely": Fraser Henleins v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100, 128. In the case of a formula all the objective elements must be identified.

49 Fraser Henliens Pty Ltd v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100 concerned whether particular formulative phrases embodied in a Prices Regulation Order made under the Black Marketing Act 1942 were so vague and uncertain as to make the order invalid as not fixing a price. Dixon J said (p 128) that a "bare power to "fix" a price cannot be validly exercised without naming a money sum, or prescribing a certain standard by the application of which it can be calculated or ascertained definitely. Otherwise the price is not "fixed"."</text>
