<text>4 In order to place the motions in some context it is necessary to recount part of the procedural history of the litigation between Mr Maher and the respondents. A more detailed account of the many encounters between the parties is to be found in the reasons for judgment of North J in Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2004] FCA 1441 at [2] , [3], [5], [6] and in the reasons of Jessup J: Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2007] FCA 113 at [2] - [7] , [12]-[14]. It is sufficient for present purposes to record that, on 2 February 2004, and, again on 5 February 2004, Finkelstein J made costs orders against Mr Maher and in favour of certain of the respondents. Mr Maher did not lodge an appeal against Finkelstein J's orders. An application for an extension of time within which to appeal against the orders, made on 5 February 2004 was refused by Heerey J on 11 May 2004. A further attempt, by application dated 18 June 2004, to impugn Finkelstein J's orders was made in the High Court. The application was refused. On 4 November 2004 a Registrar of the Court issued certificates of taxation. They related to orders which had been made by the Court on 26 September 2001 and the orders made by Finkelstein J on 2 and 5 February 2004. On 9 February 2005 a Registrar entered an order requiring Mr Maher to pay the costs identified in the two certificates to the first, second and third respondents.</text>
