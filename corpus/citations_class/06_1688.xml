<text>9 In the days preceding the hearing, Mr Jewiss through a corporation sent to the Court (but not to the Commissioner's legal representatives) medical certificates indicating that he was unfit for work by reason of illness for the period from 6 to 20 November 2006. He did not attend the hearing. He sent a letter to the Court indicating that he would be unable to do so because of illness. There is no further medical evidence to indicate his ongoing incapacity for work after 20 November 2006, or more importantly, any medical evidence stating that he was unfit to appear in Court on 20 November 2006 to conduct the proceedings or to appear in Court to support any application for an adjournment: see e.g. the remarks of Middleton J in MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 at [13] - [14] , adopting the words of Lindgren J in NAKX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559. There is no detailed medical report from any medical practitioner.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/3.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The Commissioner contends that there is now no basis upon which the claims asserted in the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim could succeed because: 
 
 1. those issues have been ventilated and determined in the District Court proceedings, and
 2. in any event, s 177 of the ITAA precludes all challenges against the "due making of an assessment", and the nature of the allegations are in fact in substance challenges to the due making of the assessments the subject of the notices: see Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614.</text>

<tocase>General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/69.html</AustLII>
<text>26 It is plain that s 31A of the FCA Act is intended to relax the test imposed by General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 as to the circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out or summarily dismissed.

27 Section 31A(2) provides that the Court may exercise that power if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the relevant part of the proceeding, and s 31A(3) explains to a degree when a proceeding should be found to have no reasonable prospect of success.

29 In my judgment, the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim should be dismissed, whether one applies the test prescribed by s 31A of the FCA Act, or whether one applies O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules , as explained in General Steel Industries . In my view, there is simply no real question to be tried on the issues raised by the Amended Application and by the Amended Statement of Claim in the circumstances of this matter.

30 It is appropriate first to advert briefly to the statutory background or context in which the assessments came to be made and the Notices issued. Section 166 of the ITAA requires the Commissioner to make an assessment of the taxable income of a taxpayer and of the tax payable thereon. If the Commissioner is not satisfied with the tax information provided by the taxpayer in the tax return furnished by the taxpayer, the Commissioner is empowered by s 167 to make an assessment of the amount upon which, in the Commissioner's judgment, income tax ought to be levied. Section 174(1) then requires that a notice of assessment of the tax to be paid be served on the taxpayer. Section 175 provides that the validity of any assessment shall not be affected by reason that any of the provisions of the ITAA have not been complied with. Relevantly to the District Court proceedings, for the reasons which are referred to above, s 177 provides that the production of the Notices under the hand of the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment, and (other than in respect of proceedings under Pt IVC of the TAA by a review or appeal relating to the assessment) is also conclusive evidence of the amount and particulars of the assessments as being correct. The procedure to be followed by a taxpayer dissatisfied with an assessment is the objection and appeal process available under Pt IVC of the TAA.</text>

<tocase>Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1147.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Section 31A commenced operation on 1 December 2005. It applies only in relation to "proceedings commenced on or after the commencement day": see item 44 of Sch 1 to the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 , and item 7 of that Act which inserted s 31A into the FCA Act. The Commissioner has submitted that s 31A applies in this instance because the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim were filed only on 15 August 2006, and that the assertion in this proceeding seeking to invalidate the Notices by reason of improper conduct on the part of officers of the respondent was first made only by the "Statement of Claim" filed on 7 July 2006. The effect of the "Statement of Claim" first filed on 7 July 2006 would appear, by O 13 rr 3(3) and 3A of the Federal Court Rules , to operate from that day as a proceeding commenced on or after that day: see Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147 at [27] . I do not need, however, to decide that question.</text>

<tocase>Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 443</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/443.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 443 at [6] , Kenny J pointed out that, although s 177(1) of the ITAA may operate to preclude a Court from examining the validity of an assessment once a notice of assessment is tendered, it can only operate provided there has been a bona fide attempt by the Commissioner to exercise the power of assessment, the attempt to exercise the assessment power relates to the subject matter of the ITAA, and the exercise of the assessment power is reasonably capable of reference to the Commissioner's power of assessment. That expression of the limitations upon the apparent scope of s 177(1) is derived from the observations of Dixon J in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 at 614. It is clear from Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 that s 177(1) does not, and cannot, deprive the High Court of its constitutional jurisdiction, and to the extent to which this Court is conferred with such jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) cannot deprive this Court of its jurisdiction under that provision. The so called Hickman principles, based upon the decision in Hickman , and which formed the basis of Kenny J's observations in Briglia , were considered by the High Court in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. I do not think it is necessary to explore whether the result of the decision in Plaintiff S157/2002 is to explain the application of the Hickman principles in a way which may broaden the capacity of the taxpayer to challenge the due making of an assessment notwithstanding s 177(1). That is simply because, in my view, on any analysis of the allegations made by Mr Jewiss in the Amended Application and in the Amended Statement of Claim, they cannot establish relevantly a failure on the part of the Commissioner in the due making of the assessments.</text>

<text>48 In my judgment, the matters which Mr Jewiss now raises in the Amended Application and in the Amended Statement of Claim correspond with the allegations made in the District Court proceedings, including on his appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia. It would be an abuse of the Court's processes to permit Mr Jewiss to re-litigate in this proceeding the same matters that have previously been determined by the District Court: cf Shumack v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2005] FCA 1476 at [4] . There is no prospect of Mr Jewiss now succeeding on those claims because they have already been decided adversely to him.</text>

<text>49 The parties in the District Court proceedings and in this proceeding are the same. The allegations generally under the umbrella of bad faith are the same. They relate to the circumstances of and conduct at the search of Mr Jewiss' premises, conduct subsequent to the raid in respect of Mr Jewiss, and use of documents which are allegedly known to be false in making the assessments and issuing the Notices. Those issues were all raised by Mr Jewiss in the District Court proceedings. They have been resolved adversely to him. There is no reason why he should be permitted to re-litigate those matters. It is in precisely such circumstances that the Court in other matters has found there to have been an abuse of process of the Court and to have exercised the power to have dismissed the proceedings: see e.g. Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers appointed in Liquidation) (1993) 115 ALR 377 at 398. As Dixon J observed in Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 531:
 
 "A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once and for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies."</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>50 I note that such a course was adopted in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1994) 51 FCR 529 on the basis of an Anshun-type estoppel: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. I accept that, in many cases where the claim is made that there is an estoppel by judgment or an issue estoppel or an Anshun-type estoppel, it is more appropriate for those issues to be determined on pleadings rather than by the summary dismissal of proceedings. But I consider that this case is a clear one, where Mr Jewiss has previously raised and had a full opportunity to ventilate the very matters which he has sought to raise by way of his Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim and those issues have been determined against him. There is no reason why he should be given a further opportunity to re-ventilate those issues in the present proceeding.

51 In this matter, I do not think there is scope for the Anshun principle to be applied, simply because in my judgment the issues now sought to be raised by Mr Jewiss are the same issues as those he sought to raise in the District Court proceedings and upon which an adjudication adverse to those claims has been made. It is not a matter of him raising matters now which he did not, but could have, raised in the earlier proceedings (cf Anshun at 602-604). It is simply a matter of him now making the same allegations. Perhaps to a minor degree Mr Jewiss now asserts the availability of further or different evidence in support of those allegations than that which he adduced at the hearing before the District Court, but that is to a degree speculative. Even if it were so, the issues themselves have been determined. They have been determined adversely to Mr Jewiss.

52 For those reasons, in my judgment, the claim in the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim have no prospect of success. They have already been decided against Mr Jewiss. Those claims are therefore an abuse of process and should be dismissed.

53 I also accept the contentions of counsel for the Commissioner, that in significant respects the allegations now, and previously made, by Mr Jewiss could not give rise to invalidity of the assessments and of the Notices. The power of search and seizure exists under s 263 of the ITAA. It is not a power which is to be construed in the same way as a search warrant. It does not require routinely the production of a written authority to support the exercise of the power. There was no obligation to produce the written authority in support of the search unless requested, and no request was made (s 263(2)). The fact that Mr Jewiss was not present when the search was carried out does not support any suggestion that it was an improper investigation. The way in which that part of the investigation was carried out was not itself capable of affecting the validity of the assessments or of the Notices. The complaint of the lack of opportunity to assert legal professional privilege in respect of the seized documents is not supported by any evidentiary allegation. It is simply a general allegation which is not made out. It does not in any event go to the validity of the Notices. In addition, as noted above, there is nothing to connect the decision-making process in respect of the Notices with those involved in the search and seizure processes or the method of their implementation.</text>
