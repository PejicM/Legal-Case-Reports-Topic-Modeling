<tocase>Woodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1</tocase>
<text>21 The Registered Designs Act 1949 (UK) adopted the concept of the informed user, with the consequence that UK courts can provide some guidance in this country. The first useful judicial exposition of the informed user standard in England appears to be that of his Honour Judge Fysh QC, sitting as the UK Patents County Court, in Woodhouse UK Plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1 (" Architectural Lighting "). In Architectural Lighting , his Honour (at [50]) defined the informed user as follows:
 First, this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design and I would think, a regular user at that. He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work. The quality smacks of practical considerations. In my view the informed user is first, a person to whom the design is directed. Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of 'the man in the street'. 'Informed' to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer; it imports the notion of 'what's about in the market?' and 'what has been about in the recent past?' I do not think it requires an archival mind (or eye) or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations (if any). In connection with the latter, one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things; as Mr Davis reminded me, these are not petty patents. Therefore, focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology (if any). I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the 'man skilled in the art' whose 'nerd-like' (and other) attributes seem too technical: Technip France SA's Patent [2004] EWCA Civ 381 ; [2004] R.P.C. 46 at [6-12] (CA). (Emphasis original) 
 The properly informed eye of the court must make its decision as a matter of degree as a matter of overall impression: see Architectural Lighting at [52].

23 Relevantly to this case, in January 2007, the Design Registrar of the UK Intellectual Property Office cited and applied the Architectural Lighting 'informed user' analysis in ruling on the validity of a clothing design registration: see Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd (UK IPO, 0-027-07, 22 January 2007) (" Walton ").

27 There may be a difference in the discussion to date as to what is needed to have the requisite product familiarity. On one view, this familiarity is greater than the information possessed by the average user; on another view, this familiarity is that which is possessed by the ordinary user: compare Architectural Lighting at [50] with Apple at [14]. The former approach is to be preferred. I doubt that, generally, the ordinary user will be appropriately regarded as an informed user. In the present context, women as a class are the ordinary users of ladies' garments, but not all women have the requisite degree of familiarity to be described as informed users. Thus, whilst there will be some women who subscribe to fashion magazines (such as Vogue or Collezioni that illustrated the prior art in this case) and have particular knowledge of, and familiarity with, fashion trends, there will be many other women who lack such knowledge and familiarity. Precedent and the text of s 19(4) indicate that it is from the perspective of someone closer to the former group that the newness and distinctiveness of the Review Design and the similarity of the Redberry garments in terms of overall impression must be judged: compare Architectural Lighting at [50].</text>

<text>22 In Proctor &amp; Gamble Co v Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd [2006] EWHC 3154 ; [2007] FSR 13 (" Proctor &amp; Gamble Co v Reckitt Benckiser ") at [31] et seq, Lewison J (Chancery Division Patents Court) considered and approved these observations, as did the Court of Appeal: see Proctor &amp; Gamble Company v Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd [2007] EWCACIV 936 ; (2007) 73 IPR 605 (" Proctor &amp; Gamble ") at [24], [25], [32] per Jacob LJ, with whom May and Dyson LJJ agreed. As Jacob J said (at [28]) "the informed user is alert to design issues and is better informed than the average consumer in trade mark law".

24 In Walton , the applicant sought to invalidate a poncho design registered by Zap Ltd ("Zap") on the grounds that it lacked novelty, in part because it copied her earlier poncho designs: see Walton at [3], [32]. Zap defended on the grounds that the basic design of the poncho has long been known, and thus there was limited freedom to design: see [15]. Applying his Honour Judge Fysh QC's definition of informed user, as approved by Lewison J in Proctor &amp; Gamble Co v Reckitt Benckiser ( Walton at [36]-[37]), the Registrar accepted Zap's submissions, concluding "I believe that an informed user would be aware that there is limited freedom to design a poncho which is not basically square or rectangular in shape": see Walton at [40]; also at [43]. Based primarily on a difference in neck design, the Registrar found that the Zap design would in fact create a different overall impression on an informed user and thus it was validly registered: see Walton at [39]-[45].</text>

<tocase>Re Application in the name of Apple Computer Inc (2007) 74 IPR 164</tocase>
<text>25 In Australia, the Australian Designs Office ("ADO") considered the informed user standard in Re Application in the name of Apple Computer Inc (2007) 74 IPR 164 (" Apple ") and Icon Plastics Pty Ltd [2007] ADO 2 (5 July 2007) (" Icon "). In Icon , the ADO cited the ALRC Report but rejected the view that "a notional informed user is a melding of the (probably divergent) views of those who exemplify a range of informed users. A better approach is to say that, in dealing with this jury question, the legislation defines a standard, such that the registrar or the court should postulate the view of a typical member of a sample of informed users": see Icon at [19]. The Registrar concluded that "to apply the standard of the informed user for the purpose of s 19 would therefore be to postulate a user that is 'reasonably' informed; not either barely informed, on one hand, or fully expert on the other": see Icon at [21]. Apple cited the ALRC Report, this time for the proposition that the informed user standard is objective, and stated the view that an informed user is an ordinary intended user of the product made from the design, who is familiar with the product: see Apple at [11], [14].

<tocase>Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories Ltd's Design Application [1974] RPC 253</tocase>
<text>51 Ultimately, it seems to me that what was said in Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories Ltd's Design Application [1974] RPC 253 at 261 is as true a guide as any. In this case, Graham J (as the UK Registered Design Appeals Tribunal) said that:
 ... colour cannot be ignored, though normally differences in colour are unlikely to be important. Colour may or may not make a material difference, depending upon the circumstances and nature of the design in question. 
I would adopt this approach in considering designs registered under the Designs Act.

52 The fact that a design is registered in colour through the use of colour photographs (unaccompanied by a statement of newness and distinctiveness) is relevant to determining the extent of the monopoly sought and given. Everything that is shown in the registered design (unless disclaimed in some way) forms part of the subject matter protected by registration. The pattern (including colour) that is shown on the registered Review Design is thus part of what is protected, and is, as the above reasoning indicates, to be accorded some weight. How much weight is to be given to pattern and colour will depend on the nature of the product and the relative importance of the different visual features of the registered design, as viewed by the informed user, having regard to the prior art, and the freedom of the designer to innovate. If colour is important, it will be so because the factors relevant to the registered design lead to this conclusion. As indicated already, pattern, including colour, is a feature that an informed user would consider has some significance in creating the overall impression of the Review Design, a conclusion borne out by the use of colour photographs to depict the design in the registration application.

53 In the present case, an informed user would, as Ms Mudie's evidence and the prior art showed, regard colour as an element in the pattern that forms part of the overall look of the registered Review Design. The Review Design is depicted on the register in a colour photograph of a store dummy wearing a garment in a patterned fabric in natural tones with orange, brown and blue fine 'fronds leaf' pattern, giving it, as Ms Mudie and Ms Ellis agreed, an African or tropical look. This pattern (and the colour that is part of it) is, however, only one element in the overall impression of the registered design. It is, as previously observed, entirely different from the pattern on the Redberry garment.

54 The applicants claimed that Redberry had made, imported and sold garments copied from the Review Design. Copying is not, however, relevant to the issue of infringement: compare Proctor &amp; Gamble at [4] per Jacob J. Copying from registered designs is permissible providing the copying does not result in a product that embodies a design that is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design.

55 A design is a registrable design if the design is new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design: see s 15(1). The expression "prior art base" is defined in s 15(2) and includes designs publicly used in Australia and designs published in a document within or outside Australia. Redberry argued that the Review Design was not validly registered because it was not new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base: see s 16. The Redberry challenge was effectively to distinctiveness rather than newness: see s 16(2). Section 16(2) calls for a determination as to whether the design said to be registrable is distinctive, which means the design is not substantially similar in overall impression to a design or designs forming part of the prior art. The test of substantial similarity here again turns on the considerations set out in s 19 of the Designs Act, to which reference has already been made.</text>

<tocase>Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1589.html</AustLII>
<text>69 The applicants also sought general damages on an alternative basis. As I stated in Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 (" New Cover "), in a case of design infringement, general damages may be awarded on the basis of the diminution of the value of the Review Design as a chose in action. The manner in which such damages are to be assessed is discussed in New Cover and applies in this case as well. As in New Cover , there is no satisfactory evidence as to the sales history of the Review Design, but there is some evidence as to the value to Review of its designs and the image they created. Adopting the approach as outlined in New Cover , if it had been necessary to do so, I would have assessed the effect of infringement at the time it occurred (and had it been made out) on the potential market for the Review Dress at $3,500.

70 In the circumstances of this case, had the claim for infringement been made out, a further question would have arisen as to whether Redberry could successfully invoke s 75(2)(b) of the Designs Act.

71 Kun Ming Liu, Redberry's managing director, secretary and shareholder, gave evidence that Redberry sourced its garments from China, where other persons manufactured them, and imported them into Australia for wholesale sale. Mr Liu's evidence was that Redberry, through its buyer, bought ready-made garments or commissioned garments after having seen the manufacturer's sample. Mr Liu denied that Redberry arranged for the manufacture of any particular garment. He was unable to say, however, whether the Redberry garments in question in this case had been bought ready-made or commissioned after the buyer was given a sample.

72 Mr Liu stated that, at the time of trial, Redberry employed a buyer named Sui Qiang Ke to select garments from suppliers and manufacturers in Guangzhou, but that Mr Ke had not bought the Redberry garment. Mr Liu stated that, between February 2006 and February 2007, Redberry had employed another person based in China to assist Mr Ke, by the name of Qi Hong Wang. Mr Liu's evidence was that Ms Wang had not worked for Redberry since that time and he had been unable to contact her. By implication, it was Ms Wang who had been the buyer for the Redberry garments.

73 There was no evidence, documentary or otherwise, identifying the manufacturer in China of the Redberry garments. Mr Liu sought to explain what might be seen as an evidentiary deficiency by reference to the failure to find Ms Wang. Further, Mr Liu's evidence was that Redberry did not keep records beyond five years (a period corresponding with taxation law provisions). This did not, however, explain the lack of records that would have identified the manufacturer of the Redberry garments since the documents in question would presumably have related to a period less than five years ago. I accept that the deficiencies in the documentary record produced to the Court were thus not adequately explained. These deficiencies weighed against accepting Mr Liu's evidence.

74 On balance, however, whilst there were some unexplained deficiencies and inconsistencies in Mr Liu's evidence, I would ultimately accept his evidence as essentially truthful. The applicants failed to persuade me that I should not do so. As I have said, Mr Liu was (amongst other things) Redberry's managing director and was knowledgeable about the generality of his company's business. Difficulties with his evidence arose from the fact that he had virtually no facility in English language. I formed the impression that, overall, he gave his evidence truthfully even if this reflected his distinctive and perhaps culturally-conditioned understanding of what had occurred and what was required in answering the questions addressed to him. I accept that Redberry did not employ its employees to make the garments in question. Mr Liu's evidence left open the possibility, however, that Redberry commissioned another person to make the garments to a sample that Redberry's buyer had been shown. Accordingly, had the buyer's direction to make the garments and/or the making of the garments taken place in Australia , then Redberry might properly have been regarded as having made the garments in contravention of s 71(1)(a) of the Designs Act. In this event, Redberry would have been liable for a primary infringement, as opposed to a secondary infringement and Redberry would have been unable to rely on s 75(2)(b) of the Designs Act. I discuss below the significance of the fact that, on Mr Liu's evidence, the buyer commissioned the making of the garments in China , where the garments were manufactured.

83 The applicants sought additional damages under s 75(3) of the Designs Act. I would not regard such additional damages as having been warranted, even if the infringement claim were made out. I refer to the general principles concerning additional damages as outlined in New Cover at [53].

84 If Redberry infringed, its conduct in importing and selling the Redberry garments in July 2006 was in ignorance of Review 2's design rights and at a time when the existence of such rights had only briefly been a matter of public record. Redberry's infringing conduct (if this is what it was) could not on any view be considered flagrant: see also [79] above. Redberry apparently ceased the conduct of which the applicants complain when it became aware of their claim and, in any case, before the issue of proceedings. The amount of profit to Redberry was modest less than $2000.

85 In substance, the applicants' case on additional damages rested on allegations as to the "the closeness of copying" and that it was "the apparent business practice of Redberry and/or related entities to engage in copying the garment designs of other designers". Ultimately, notwithstanding the submissions of the applicants' counsel to the contrary, I would regard the evidence designed to support these allegations as irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. Put another way, the evidence that the applicants sought to have admitted under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) is not so admissible because it would not have the significant probative value that the provision requires. Two of the applicants' other garments were the subject of specific cross-examination. PS 10 and PS 13 and PS 11 and PS 14 (being two sets of identical Review and Redberry garments) were put to Mr Liu in cross-examination and he conceded, as indeed he had to do, that they were very much the same. Indeed, they were plainly identical or virtually identical. At most, however, this evidence, if admissible, established that, on at least two occasions, Redberry had imported and sold by wholesale garments that were copies of Review garments. (Other labels were also canvassed in cross-examination, but nothing additional need be said about this.) In the designs context, copying per se is not unlawful, however, and does not establish a design infringement.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>75 Counsel for the applicants argued that, when Redberry called Mr Liu, it called the wrong witness, and that it should have called the buyer, Mr Ke. In relation to the absence of Mr Ke, he relied on the rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 (" Jones v Dunkel "). The applicants' counsel argued that the inference as to Redberry's status as a manufacturer might, in the absence of testimony from Mr Ke, be more comfortably drawn against Redberry. I reject this submission. The evidence was that Mr Ke had not bought the garments in question. This being so, it might fairly be thought unnecessary and even inappropriate to call him. In this circumstance, the absence of testimony from Mr Ke does not justify an application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel .

76 In this context too, counsel for the applicants relied on the similarity between the Redberry garment and the Review Design, as supportive of the fact that the manufacturer of the Redberry garments had copied the Review Design. This would not, however, provide any evidence that Redberry (as opposed to someone else) made the garments in question. Counsel for the applicants also sought to rely on evidence that the applicants and other persons had alleged on other occasions that Redberry had copied garments and thereby infringed copyright and trade mark. For the reasons explained below, however, I would not regard this evidence as admissible.</text>

Following Hella-Australia , Parliament amended s 30, with the result that the importation and sale of articles to which the design had been applied outside Australia were also infringements: see Designs Amendment Act 1967 (Cth) ("the 1967 Amendment") and Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 at 293. Although Hella-Australia concerned a provision in the former Act, nonetheless it and the authorities referred to in Carnival Cruise and Carnival Cruise itself, establish that, absent contrary statutory intent, infringements must occur within Australia. Accordingly, on the evidence, Redberry's liability could not arise under s 71(1)(a) but only under s 71(1)(b), (c), (d) or (e).</text>

<text>77 As noted above, however, if Redberry's buyer commissioned the making of the garments, the buyer did so in China, where the garments were manufactured. Section 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) provides that, in any Act, unless the contrary intention appears, "references to localities jurisdictions and other matters and things shall be construed as references to such localities jurisdictions and other matters and things in and of the Commonwealth". This provision reflects the common law presumption that statutes are read "as being prima facie restricted in their operation within territorial limits": see Jumbunna Coal Mine NL v Victorian Coal Miners' Association [1908] HCA 95 ; (1908) 6 CLR 309 at 363 per O'Connor J, discussed in DC Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) at [5.5]. The effect of s 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) is implicitly acknowledged in s 4 of the Designs Act. Section 21(1)(b) of this Act operates to confine the making or offering to make, with which s 71(1)(a) of the Designs Act is concerned, to a making or an offering to make in Australia (as s 4 of the Designs Act reflects): compare Hella-Australia Pty Ltd v Quinton Hazell (Aust) Pty Ltd (1967) 10 FLR 86 (" Hella-Australia "), which Gummow J cited with approval in Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Ltd (1994) 120 ALR 495 (" Carnival Cruise ") at 509.
