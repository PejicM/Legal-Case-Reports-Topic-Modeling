<tocase>Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612</tocase>
<text>The applicant says that in "timing" cases such as those presented by the 1992 and 1994 years, a taxpayer can object to an assessment on the basis that it is too low. Reliance is placed on Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612 at 646 per Barwick CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed.

The applicant points out that objections in relation to the 1992 and 1994 years are before the Court in relation to an issue other than those involved in this application to amend. The amendment application is filed in all proceedings on foot, including those for the 1992 and 1994 years. Section 67(2) of the Act empowers the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time to give effect to a decision on a review or appeal. If the applicant is successful in its contention that amounts should be excised from its assessable receipts in the 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1996 years, the Commissioner will in my view have power under s 67(2) to amend the assessments for 1992 and 1994 by increasing the assessable receipts for those years.

The Commissioner raised a technical obstacle to the course described in [36]. This was that as matters stand at present there is simply an application for leave to add an additional ground. Until the objections are actually amended, so that the issue for the 1992 and 1994 years are in fact before the Court, the prejudice to the Commissioner cannot be avoided. In order to assuage the Commissioner's concern, Counsel for the applicant proffered an undertaking that the issue will be brought before the Court so that an order under s 67(2) can be made. I accept that undertaking.</text>

<tocase>Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>The Commissioner's complaint is as to the unexplained delay between the applicant's receipt of the 1997 assessment in August 2000 and Mr Leyden's discovery in May 2007. It is true, as the Commissioner maintains, that as an organisation (ie apart from Mr Leyden's explanation), the applicant has been guilty of serious delay. However, when Mr Leyden discovered the true position, he acted promptly to alert the Commissioner to the "new point" and seek his consent to raise the new grounds. As has often been said, an application for leave to amend is not the occasion for punishing a party for its delay in making the application. See Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146 at 155. This is very complicated litigation with many difficult issues spread over several tax years. While the delay is unfortunate, it is not of an order that should prevent all live issues between the parties being resolved in the one proceeding.

I will grant leave to add the grounds the subject of pars 1 to 3 of the proposed minutes of orders handed up by the applicant. If the Commissioner seeks a more formal undertaking than that noted at [37], attention should be given to its form. I will also make the orders sought in pars 4 and 5 of the draft minutes.
 I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.
