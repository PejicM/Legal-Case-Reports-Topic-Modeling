<text>This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia given on 12 September 2008 and published as MZYBB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1462. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application to reinstate a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court that had been dismissed previously on the basis of the appellant's failure to attend a directions hearing. The original proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court was an application by the appellant, seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"). The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), the first respondent to this appeal, refusing to grant to the appellant a protection visa.

The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. He arrived in Australia on 5 February 2007 in possession of a tourist visa, which was granted to him while he was in Brunei. On 16 March 2007, he applied for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate refusing to grant that visa was made on 28 June 2007. The Tribunal's decision affirming the decision not to grant a protection visa was signed on 1 May 2008 and handed down or sent on 22 May 2008.

By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention, as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the Convention. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country</text>
