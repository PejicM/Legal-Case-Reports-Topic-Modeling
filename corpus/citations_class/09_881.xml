<text>The finding of the Tribunal in this regard was open to it on the evidence. The weight the Tribunal gives to any piece of evidence is a matter for it to decide and there is no scope for judicial review simply because another decision-maker might give greater or lesser weight to a particular matter: see Abebe v Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 580 and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 440. The Court may not engage in fact-finding about the merits of the appellant's case.</text>

<text>In my view his Honour was correct. The findings of the Tribunal were open to it on the evidence before it. This ground invites the Court to undertake a review of the fact finding of the Tribunal. To establish that there is a legal error in connection with a finding of the Tribunal, the appellant must be able to demonstrate that there was no basis whatsoever to support a finding made or inference drawn by the Tribunal: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356. It can not be established that there was no basis for the Tribunal finding. Rather the Tribunal carefully considered the appellant's evidence before arriving at a conclusion, albeit adverse to the appellant. It is well-established that it is no part of the function of the court, in dealing with judicial review of an administrative decision, to engage in fact-finding about the merits of the appellants' case: see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] . The Court must be wary of turning a review of the Tribunal's decision into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.</text>

<tocase>MZXNQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 197</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/197.html</AustLII>
<text>This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 18 March 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") handed down on 9 April 2008: see MZXNQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 197. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.

The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. The appellant entered Australia on 3 February 1999 on a Student visa. On 12 August 2002 he lodged an application for a protection visa with the (now) Department of Immigration and Citizenship.

The appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his political opinion due to his involvement with the People's Alliance ("PA"). The appellant claimed that he supported a PA candidate ("the candidate"), organised the local youth wing of the PA, and attended protests against the United National Party ("UNP"). He claimed that, as a result of his involvement, he was subjected to a number of incidents of persecution from supporters of the UNP. He claimed that he was assaulted by a mob when attending an anti-UNP protest in 1994 and that people later came with weapons to his aunt's house where he was living in hiding and inquired about him. He further claimed that, in June 1994, he was assaulted by a gang, which resulted in him sustaining an injury to his arm and requiring treatment in hospital. He said that the candidate he supported advised him to leave the country because he was being targeted by the UNP.</text>

The weight that the Tribunal ultimately gives to a piece of evidence is a matter for it to decide. In such circumstances, there is limited scope for judicial review: see NBKT at 440 and Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 464 at [26] . Further, the Tribunal's choice and assessment of independent country information is a factual matter for it: see NAHI at [13].

In any case, even if it could be established that the Tribunal made an error of fact by relying on incorrect country information, this would not amount to a jurisdictional error: see NAHI at [10].

The findings of the Tribunal regarding the politicians in Sri Lanka, which was based on the DFAT report, were open to it on the evidence before it. There is no apparent error in the Tribunal's reliance on this report.

The fourth ground is not made out. GROUND 5 
 The Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant was not telling the truth about his involvement in the PA youth groups was based on its erroneous conclusions in Grounds 1 through 4 above.</text>
