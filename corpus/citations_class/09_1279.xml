<text>The Minister submits that the concerns that the Tribunal had with the applicant's evidence were put to him. His Honour's conclusion that the Tribunal was frank and open in drawing attention to its concerns about the applicant's claims has not been shown to be in error. His Honour concluded that the ground based on s 424 of the Act was not made out, as there was no invitation for additional information pursuant to s 424. The applicant has not made out any such breach and there is no limitation on the general power under s 424(1) on the part of the Tribunal to obtain additional information ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30 ; (2009) 258 ALR 434).

As to the applicant's assertion of procedural unfairness on the part of the tribunal, in that he said the Tribunal did not give him an opportunity to be heard, his Honour rejected that assertion.

I accept the Minister's submission that there was no arguable case before the Federal Magistrate, and that the Federal Magistrates Court was entitled to exercise its discretion to dismiss the application without proceeding to a final hearing. There is not sufficient doubt about the Federal Magistrate's decision to warrant it being reconsidered by this Court. His Honour was entitled to dismiss the matter as he did. The applicant has not described any error in his Honour's decision. In my view, as the case has been presented in this Court, even if his Honour were in error, no substantial injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused.

It follows that the application for leave to appeal is dismissed. The applicant is to pay the first respondent's costs.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

<tocase>SZNOG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 690</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/690.html</AustLII>
<text>This is an application for leave to appeal against the judgment of Driver FM of 21 July 2009, SZNOG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 690 , dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 8 April 2009 and sent to the applicant on 9 April 2009. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister who formed the view that the applicant was not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention and accordingly refused to grant a protection visa on 15 December 2008.

The proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court began with a show cause application filed on 4 May 2009. The dismissal of the application by the Federal Magistrates Court was interlocutory by reason of rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). Leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment requires the applicant to show that there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the judgment below to warrant review and, further, that if the judgment below is assumed to be wrong, substantial injustice will be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused.

The applicant is a citizen of India who arrived in Australia on 12 August 2008. He lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on 18 September 2008. The delegate refused the application on 15 December 2008. On 13 January 2009, the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. I will deal with the chronology that followed later in these reasons.

In his application for a protection visa, the applicant claimed that he was born in a moderate Muslim family. He claimed that in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Mosque in 1992 and in the wake of the inter-religious riots that followed, his own family's home was set alight. He claimed that his father was an active member of the local Muslim community whose business was ransacked by a Hindu group called the RSS.

The applicant claimed that he joined a group called the TMMK and was arrested by the police for attempting to hold a rally to ensure improved employment and living conditions for local Muslims. He claimed that he was interrogated and tortured. He claimed that he was thereafter targeted by police whenever there was a bombing and the Muslims were blamed for everything.</text>
