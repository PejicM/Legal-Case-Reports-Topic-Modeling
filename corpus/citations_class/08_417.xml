<text>10 An appeal to this Court does not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed: Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 52, r 17. The " general principle " applied in this Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377 at [6] (Appl'd: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [8] ). But s 29(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) does confer a discretionary power to make an order suspending the operation of an order previously made. That subsection provides as follows:
 
 Stay of proceedings and suspension of orders 
 (1) Where an appeal to the Court from another court has been instituted: 
 ... 
 (b) the Court or a Judge may, by order, on such conditions (if any) as it or he or she thinks fit, suspend the operation of an injunction or other order to which the appeal, in whole or in part, relates.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/942.html</AustLII>
<text>14 The Applications made by all Respondents seeking security for costs invoke s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That section confers a " broad power ": James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 at 444 per Toohey J. The general principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion are not in dispute and have been conveniently set out by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 and summarised by Bennett J in Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE (New South Wales) [2003] FCA 942. In Croker , Bennett J at [26] listed the considerations to be taken into account as follows:
 
 &#8226; The prospects of success;
 &#8226; The quantum of risk that a costs order will not be satisfied;
 &#8226; Whether the making of an order would be oppressive in that it would stifle a reasonable arguable claim;
 &#8226; Whether any impecuniosity of the appellants arises out of the conduct complained of;
 &#8226; Whether there are aspects of public interest which weigh in the balance against such an order;
 &#8226; Whether there are any particular discretionary matters peculiar to the circumstances of the case.
 

A determination as to whether security should be awarded and, if so, the quantum of such security, is essentially one of risk management between the parties having regard to their legitimate interests: East Grace Corp v Xing [2005] FCA 219 at [5] per French J.

23 A principal submission advanced by all Respondents, and a submission in accordance with the considerations summarised by Bennett J in Croker, contended that the Notice of Appeal had such limited prospects of success as to be in itself a persuasive reason why security should be ordered.

24 The Notice of Appeal as filed sets forth some 27 grounds of appeal. Ms Lawrance was invited on 17 March 2008 to consider whether she wished to pursue all of those grounds or whether she wished to narrow or confine her appeal. On 18 March 2008 she adhered to the grounds set forth.

25 An appellant is of course entitled to raise for resolution such grounds of appeal as may properly emerge from the decision the subject of appeal. For the purposes of the present proceedings, each of those grounds have been separately considered.</text>

16 At the outset of the hearing of the two Motions seeking security, the evidence to be relied upon was, in the usual course, identified.

17 In addition, Ms Lawrance indicated that she wished to adduce evidence as to events which had occurred on 15 February 2008. She outlined the nature of the evidence that she sought to adduce. Although such evidence had not been filed in accordance with earlier directions made on 4 February 2008, Ms Lawrance indicated that she was not previously sure as to how she should proceed.</text>

<text>14 The Applications made by all Respondents seeking security for costs invoke s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That section confers a " broad power ": James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 at 444 per Toohey J.

A determination as to whether security should be awarded and, if so, the quantum of such security, is essentially one of risk management between the parties having regard to their legitimate interests: East Grace Corp v Xing [2005] FCA 219 at [5] per French J.

49 The quantification of any order for security is " certainly not an exact science ": East Grace Corp v Xing [2005] FCA 219 at [6] per French J.

50 Relevant to any quantification is the anticipated duration of an appeal, the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the extent to which the preparation of written submissions would facilitate the expeditious resolution of the appeal. The fact is that the Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court sets forth some 27 " grounds of appeal ". A review of those grounds only supports a conclusion that the appeal would most probably take two days, if not more. It is, perhaps, inevitable that an unrepresented appellant may take longer to develop arguments and submissions than a party represented by experienced counsel. The hearing of the present Motions seeking security was heard over a two-day period.

51 The more wide-ranging the challenge to a decision on appeal, however, the greater may be the reluctance to deny to those parties who have already vindicated their position at first instance the protection of an order for security. The more confined the grounds which an appellant may wish to pursue, the less persuasive may be the consideration that an appellant is " dragging his opponent from one Court to another " and seeking to re-agitate some, if not all, of the grievances resolved at first instance.</text>

<tocase>Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation [1992] FCA 388 ; (1992) 37 FCR 288</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/388.html</AustLII>
<text>47 Ms Lawrance, however, has already had the opportunity to have her claims litigated and has lost. Although she is entitled to prosecute her appeal in this Court, different considerations apply when security for costs is ordered in respect to an appeal: Tait v Bindal People [2002] FCA 322. Spender J there outlined the principles to be applied as follows:
 
 [2] The position in relation to security for costs in the present matter is governed by s56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). S56 provides that security is to be of such amount and given at such time and in such manner and form as the Court or Judge directs. As to whether security for costs should be ordered, Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, a case of more than 100 years ago, sets out the fundamental principle:
 "The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant, that, from time immemorial, has been the rule at common law. There is an exception in the case of appeals, but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty's Courts, and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the Courts, but only prevented, if he cannot find security, from dragging his opponent from one Court to another".
 [3] What that passage demonstrates is that there is a difference in principle in relation to the ordering of security for costs in a first instance matter and the ordering, or the consideration of the ordering, of security for costs where one is at the appellate level. The difference is that, at the appellant level, there has already been a determination adverse to the person against whom security for costs is sought and, if it be shown that there is a substantial risk that even if successful the respondent to the application for leave to appeal, or to an appeal, will be deprived of his costs, such an outcome would clearly be unjust.
 [4] In a sense, it would be giving to a person who has been on the receiving end so to speak of a determination by the courts a free hit at great cost to the other party in the appeal proceedings. That consideration, it seems to me, is also reinforced by the judgment of Gummow J in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor [1988] FCA 568 , unreported 5 September 1988. That case involved appeals against extradition with penal consequences. Such consequences were clearly very relevant considerations, but discretionary reasons moved the Court not to order. Such discretionary considerations, which were particularly noted by Gummow J, included the delay between the filing of the papers and the bringing of the applications for security. His Honour referred to a particular circumstance which is relevant here, and that is that the applicant for security has a judgment in its favour. There was a reference by Gummow J to Bethune v Porteous (1892) 18 VLR 493 , again an old case. In that case, Hood J said (at 494):
 "the reason underlying the numerous and varying cases in which appellants have been ordered to give security will be found in the injustice to a successful litigant that may be caused if he be compelled to contest the matter for a second time without a probability of obtaining his costs if ultimately successful."
 That really is the fundamental question of justice behind my decision to order security for costs.

<text>45 By reason of her impecuniosity, there is considered to be a real risk that any costs order which may ultimately be made against Ms Lawrance may not be paid. Such has been the fate of the Respondents to date in other proceedings. In exercising the discretion to order that security be provided, it is relevant to take into account any outstanding costs orders which remain unsatisfied: Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2004] FCA 601 at [14] . Ms Lawrance has not paid the costs ordered to be paid by the Federal Magistrate, including not only the orders as to costs in favour of the present Respondents, but also orders as to costs made by the Federal Magistrate against Ms Lawrance in favour of persons not parties to the proceedings before that Court. Those costs orders included, for example, an order that Ms Lawrance pay the costs incurred by the Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Fox in relation to the unsuccessful application for their joinder as parties to the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings. A like order for costs was made against Ms Lawrance in favour of Dr Margaret Pickles in relation to an unsuccessful application for joinder.</text>

<tocase>Lawrance v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1524</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1524.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Some of these grounds, although not all, it should be noted, have been previously considered in this Court. Thus in Lawrance v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1524 leave to appeal was sought in respect to a refusal to join the Guardianship Tribunal and to challenge rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. Leave to appeal was refused. In refusing leave, Buchanan J conducted a detailed review of the proceedings to date and concluded in part as follows:
 
 [2] ... In any event she has not made out a sufficient case of arguable error with respect to any of the rulings which she desires to challenge if leave to appeal is given.
 ...
 [57] It will be seen that one basis for refusing leave to amend the application (or to join the Guardianship Tribunal) was that such matters are beyond the jurisdiction of the FMCA by reason of s 46PO of the HREOC Act. Another was that there was no material to suggest the existence of orders or instruments of the kind which Ms Lawrance sought to have revoked. Nothing has been advanced in support of the application for leave to appeal which satisfactorily addresses the foundation for these rulings or calls their correctness into question. At the hearing before me Ms Lawrance confirmed that the Guardianship Tribunal was not referred to anywhere in the material she put before HREOC in connection with her terminated complaint and she did not know of the existence of any orders by the Guardianship Tribunal relating to her or whether the Guardianship Tribunal had given any consideration at any time to her circumstances. Her desire to seek any relief against the Guardianship Tribunal, or in relation to its orders, must be seen as speculative and clearly outside the scope of her terminated complaint. There is no prospect an appeal in relation to this issue could succeed.
 ...
 [63] The Federal Magistrate also excluded details of the conduct of numerous persons other than the personal respondents relating to matters which he had earlier ruled, on 17 November 2006 ( Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors [2006] FMCA 1792) , were outside the scope of the matters before him and outside the scope of the FMCA's jurisdiction as granted by s 46PO of the HREOC Act. He stated that '[t]he applicant's evidence of these matters is therefore irrelevant and inadmissible insofar as she continues to pursue complaints which I had found not to be within jurisdiction'. He indicated that he would have excluded the evidence upon discretionary grounds in any event.
 [64] No matter of any substance has been advanced in support of the application for leave to appeal so far as those rulings are concerned. That circumstance alone dictates rejection of the application so far as it concerns rulings on evidence. There are other obstacles also. 
 

No submission has been advanced by the Respondents that the further pursuit of those issues which have been previously considered by Buchanan J amounts to an abuse of process. But it is considered that no reason has now been advanced by Ms Lawrance to reach any different conclusion to that reached by Buchanan J. The one reason advanced by Ms Lawrance as to why weight should not be given to the conclusions of Buchanan J was the contention that before his Honour the question as to whether there had been an error in the identification of the ambit of the complaint was not put in issue. This was one of the " fundamental questions of law " which it is contended was resolved erroneously by the Federal Magistrate.

29 Insofar as Ms Lawrance contends that her Grounds of Appeal raise fundamental questions of law, she contends that the Federal Magistrate erred in both:
 
(i) the manner in which his Honour resolved the subject of the complaint made to the Commission, that error being as to the persons the subject of complaint and the period of time during which the conduct complained of occurred; and 
 
(ii) " describing the comparator for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 as 'any unimpaired litigant' ".
 
The former error, she contended, underlay the Federal Magistrate's rulings ( inter alia ) as to discovery and admissibility of evidence.

30 Such Grounds of Appeal as seek to raise these contentions, it is considered, do not have any real prospects of success.

31 The relevance of identifying the subject matter of the complaint as made to the Commission arises by reason of the fact that s 46PO(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) confers an entitlement to make an application to this Court and the fact that s 46PO(3) confines any such application to the same conduct as was the subject of complaint. Those subsections provide as follows: 
 
 Application to court if complaint is terminated 
 (1) If: 
 (a) a complaint has been terminated by the President under section 46PE or 46PH ; and 
 (b) the President has given a notice to any person under subsection 46PH(2) in relation to the termination; 
 any person who was an affected person in relation to the complaint may make an application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court, alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint. 
 ...
 (3) The unlawful discrimination alleged in the application: 
 (a) must be the same as (or the same in substance as) the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint; or 
 (b) must arise out of the same (or substantially the same) acts, omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint.

32 The Federal Magistrate in the present appeal relevantly concluded:
 
 [2] The Court's jurisdiction in discrimination matters is confined by s.46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) to the ambit of a complaint which was terminated by the President of the Commission, and to the respondents to the complaint. In the present matter, I decided at an interlocutory stage that Ms Lawrance's application did not encompass complaints against persons other than the present respondents, nor against government agencies except to the extent that the conduct of the personal respondents in 2005 and 2006 was alleged to have evidenced and formed part of a programme or policy directed at her by Commonwealth and State agencies...

33 Any Ground of Appeal seeking to challenge this ruling and this conclusion has little, if any, prospects of success. It may be accepted that a complaint as made to the Commission is not to be construed as though it were in any manner analogous to a pleading. Even approaching the complaint as made to the Commission in as flexible a manner as possible, it is considered that it would be difficult to reach any conclusion other than that reached by the Federal Magistrate. Ms Lawrance clearly and unambiguously identified the persons against whom the complaint was being made and the period of time during which the conduct complained of was said to have occurred. Her letter of complaint to the Commission dated 21 April 2006 thus stated in part as follows:
 
 The respondents to this complaint are Andras Markus, of the Australian Government Solicitor, and the following Federal Court staff: Michael Wall, Gerard English, Juliet Curtin, Kim Lackenby, Michael Packer and John Petkovshek ...
 I wish to add a further respondent, the State of New South Wales ... 
 The conduct of which I complain began fairly soon after I filed a Notice of Appeal in NSD 1148 of 2004 in the Federal Court ...
 The conduct that I have been exposed to since 2005 has been unmistakeably aimed at me, and impossible to not notice ...</text>

<tocase>Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 4) [2007] FMCA 1408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/1408.html</AustLII>
<text>34 It would also be erroneous to conclude that it was the manner in which the Federal Magistrate resolved the question as to the ambit of the conduct complained of to the Commission as being the sole determinant as to whether evidence was either admitted or excluded -- that was but one of a number of reasons given for the conclusions reached. Thus, in Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 4) [2007] FMCA 1408 the Federal Magistrate addressed the admissibility of evidence and concluded in part as follows:
 
 [18] Fourthly, I have rejected very extensive material which amounts to no more than submissions repeating the general contentions of fact and law made in the applicant's points of claim documents, her particulars and her written submissions. These parts of the applicant's affidavits serve no useful function in assisting the Court or respondents to understand the applicant's case, and are embarrassing to the proceeding. I have therefore rejected those parts.
 ...
 [21] Furthermore the alleged conduct of these other persons prior to 2005, as narrated by the applicant in her affidavits, does not in my opinion carry any probative assistance towards establishing, directly or indirectly, the particular conduct complained about in this proceeding, nor its relevant character under the anti-discrimination legislation invoked by the applicant, nor its relevant effects on the applicant. In my opinion, it is inadmissible under the relevancy test in s 55.

35 The other fundamental error identified by Ms Lawrance is said to be the manner in which the Federal Magistrate identified the " comparator " for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). This alleged error, it is said, emerges from the following observations of the Federal Magistrate:
 
 [3] After hearing all the relevant evidence, including oral evidence from Ms Lawrance and all the personal respondents, I have decided that her application fails at its factual foundations. Ms Lawrance did not, at any stage in the proceeding, tender evidence which gave any substance to her allegations that the personal respondents acted, either individually or together, pursuant to a programme, policy, understanding or arrangement which imputed her with mental illness or other impairment amounting to a "disability" under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). Nothing in their individual conduct imputed her with a disability, nor amounted to sexual harassment or discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). She was not victimised by any of them, nor by their employers nor other government agencies, as a result of her earlier complaints. She was treated no differently than any unimpaired litigant acting for herself or himself in similar circumstances. The conduct of the personal respondents was entirely innocent, and did not amount to any of the breaches of discrimination legislation which are alleged. There was no conduct on their part for which their employers, or the Commonwealth, or the State of NSW, are liable.

36 The relevant Ground of Appeal contends as follows:
 
 ... Federal Magistrate Smith has acted upon a wrong principle and failed to take into account a material consideration ... The definition of 'disability' is that given under section 4(K). The comparator is not correctly identified as "any unimpaired litigant." The comparator is a person who is not being imputed with a psychiatric impairment or mental illness, and, is female. ...

39 The Grounds of Appeal also seek to put in issue the procedural fairness extended by the Federal Magistrate to Ms Lawrance. The grounds are variously expressed and range from contentions that procedural fairness was denied by reason of the failure to consider evidence or submissions to the manner in which his Honour expressed his reasons for interlocutory applications. The Magistrate in one interlocutory decision ( Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 4) [2007] FMCA 1408) thus excluded evidence of events prior to 2005 and stated in part as follows:
 
 [23] ... The prejudice the respondents face in being forced to address all of that history is clear, and, in my opinion it should be excluded under s 135 of the Evidence Act ...
 

One Ground of Appeal seeks to contend that "nowhere is such prejudice identified, and its existence is unclear or not clear ". It is said that the Federal Magistrate has denied the now Appellant procedural fairness.

40 Grounds of Appeal asserting a denial of procedural fairness, it is considered, have little if any prospects of success. The Federal Magistrate has made rulings on the ambit of the complaint and that ruling was part of his Honour's approach to the evidence to be adduced. Extending the evidence beyond the period of time encompassed by the complaint would clearly expose the Federal Magistrates Court and the Respondents to further time being expended in the pursuit of that which was held to be irrelevant. The " prejudice " in doing so is readily apparent. In this Court, Counsel for the Second Respondent informed the Court without objection that subpoenas were issued to all of the individual Respondents to attend to give evidence. And they did so.

41 In addition to submitting that her Notice of Appeal had such prospects of success as to not warrant an exercise of the discretion to order security, a further principal consideration relied upon by Ms Lawrance was her impecuniosity.

42 All Respondents, for the purposes of the present Motion , conceded that Ms Lawrance was suffering financial hardship and would not be able to provide security.

43 All Respondents nevertheless sought security.</text>

<text>1 On 30 November 2007 a Federal Magistrate dismissed an application brought by the now Appellant in the Federal Magistrates Court: Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 5) [2007] FMCA 1934. In that Court, the Federal Magistrate concluded that Ms Lawrance had not established any conduct contrary to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) and had not established any basis for the grant of relief under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth).

2 Ms Lawrance has filed in this Court a Notice of Appeal seeking to challenge the decision made on 30 November 2007.

3 Now before the Court are three Applications : the first is an Application made by Ms Lawrance seeking to suspend the order as to costs made against her by the Federal Magistrate; the second is an Application made on behalf of the State of New South Wales (the Second Respondent) seeking an order that security for costs be provided and seeking a stay of proceedings until such time as security is provided; and the third is a like Application made on behalf of the remaining respondents.</text>

<text>47 Ms Lawrance, however, has already had the opportunity to have her claims litigated and has lost. Although she is entitled to prosecute her appeal in this Court, different considerations apply when security for costs is ordered in respect to an appeal: Tait v Bindal People [2002] FCA 322. Spender J there outlined the principles to be applied as follows:
 
 [2] The position in relation to security for costs in the present matter is governed by s56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). S56 provides that security is to be of such amount and given at such time and in such manner and form as the Court or Judge directs. As to whether security for costs should be ordered, Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, a case of more than 100 years ago, sets out the fundamental principle:
 "The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant, that, from time immemorial, has been the rule at common law. There is an exception in the case of appeals, but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty's Courts, and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the Courts, but only prevented, if he cannot find security, from dragging his opponent from one Court to another".
 [3] What that passage demonstrates is that there is a difference in principle in relation to the ordering of security for costs in a first instance matter and the ordering, or the consideration of the ordering, of security for costs where one is at the appellate level. The difference is that, at the appellant level, there has already been a determination adverse to the person against whom security for costs is sought and, if it be shown that there is a substantial risk that even if successful the respondent to the application for leave to appeal, or to an appeal, will be deprived of his costs, such an outcome would clearly be unjust.
 [4] In a sense, it would be giving to a person who has been on the receiving end so to speak of a determination by the courts a free hit at great cost to the other party in the appeal proceedings. That consideration, it seems to me, is also reinforced by the judgment of Gummow J in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor [1988] FCA 568 , unreported 5 September 1988. That case involved appeals against extradition with penal consequences. Such consequences were clearly very relevant considerations, but discretionary reasons moved the Court not to order. Such discretionary considerations, which were particularly noted by Gummow J, included the delay between the filing of the papers and the bringing of the applications for security. His Honour referred to a particular circumstance which is relevant here, and that is that the applicant for security has a judgment in its favour. There was a reference by Gummow J to Bethune v Porteous (1892) 18 VLR 493 , again an old case. In that case, Hood J said (at 494):
 "the reason underlying the numerous and varying cases in which appellants have been ordered to give security will be found in the injustice to a successful litigant that may be caused if he be compelled to contest the matter for a second time without a probability of obtaining his costs if ultimately successful."
 That really is the fundamental question of justice behind my decision to order security for costs.
