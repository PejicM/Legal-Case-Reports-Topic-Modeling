<tocase>Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/81.html</AustLII>
<text>The Respondents then pointed to the now accepted position that there is no constitutional prohibition against the appointment of more than one Minister of State to administer a department: Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [17] ; 415-416; [66], 460, [211]; 498, [320] and 519, [380]; Zoeller v Attorney-General (Cth) (1987) 16 FCR 153 at 165; Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 at 594; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [No 2] [2007] FCA 1684 at [128] to [130]. That being so, it was submitted that the Minister was entitled to administer the Judiciary Act , which included the administration of s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code , to the extent that it was rendered applicable by s 68 of the Judiciary Act to the pardon application made by the Applicant.

As already noted, s 68 of the Judiciary Act must be read subject to the Constitution : s 15A Acts Interpretation Act . While that provision of the Acts Interpretation Act has a purpose in preserving statutory provisions from invalidity by promoting their construction so as to accord with the limits of constitutional legislative competence, it also serves as a reminder that Commonwealth legislation ought not be construed in a way which ignores constitutionally permissible practices in the discharge of the business of the Executive Government. R v Judd [1919] HCA 9 ; (1919) 26 CLR 168 , O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1 , Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 , Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Doody [1993] QB 157 each offer an example of ways in which such practices have been taken into account by the courts in the construction of legislation and with regard to the validity of the exercise of powers by public officials. It is useful also to recall the following observations made by Gleeson CJ in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [15] [16] with respect to the provisions in the Constitution concerning the Executive Government of the Commonwealth: 
 For the framers of the Constitution to have descended into greater specificity would have imposed an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of inflexibility upon constitutional arrangements that need to be capable of development and adaptability. The deliberate lack of specificity is demonstrated by the absence of any reference to such prominent features of our system of democratic government as the office of Prime Minister, or the Cabinet. 

 
 The concept of administration of departments of State, appearing in s 64 , is not further defined. This is hardly surprising. The practices and conventions which promote efficient and effective government administration alter over time, and need to be able to respond to changes in circumstances and in theory.</text>

<text>No case was cited as authority for the existence of a power to make such orders and none of any worth could be. For such orders are quite beyond the powers granted to the Court under s 16 of the ADJR Act. They are most certainly not, contrary to the Applicant's submission, authorised by s 16(1)(d) of that Act. To make such an order would be fundamentally to violate the role of a reviewing court on judicial review, qv Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1989-1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36.

<tocase>Condren; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) v R [1991] 1 Qd R 574</tocase>
<text>Further insight into the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 672A(a) is offered by another Queensland Court of Appeal decision, R v Daley; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2005] QCA 162 , and by earlier Queensland authorities concerning that section referred to by Keane JA, who delivered the principal judgment in that case (Williams and Muir JJA agreeing). His Honour observed: 
 It may be said that this new evidence might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial so that it would not satisfy the test for the admission of "fresh evidence" enunciated in Ratten v. The Queen [1974] HCA 35 ; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516, 517. However that may be, it seems that on a reference under Section 672A, the Court has a broader discretion to ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done. See The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566 ; The Queen v. Condren Ex Parte Attorney-General [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 578, 579. 

 
 ... 

 
 [The] issue was not whether Mr Daley's legal representation was incompetent. The issue is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See TKWJ v. The Queen (2002) 202 CLR 124; Ali v. The Queen [2005] HCA 8 ; (2005) 214 ALR 1.

It is one thing to set aside a conviction upon such a reference applying this test but, having done so, quite another to order the entry of a verdict of acquittal, as opposed to ordering a new trial. To order the former is to usurp a function ordinarily consigned to a jury under our system of criminal justice in respect of offences prosecuted on indictment. A discretion exists, but ordinarily an appellate court would exercise it against the entry of a verdict of acquittal unless it had held that the case considered as a whole required a jury to acquit the appellant because it must entertain a reasonable doubt or that a conviction would necessarily be unsafe: Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45 ; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at 297, [23] per Gaudron and Hayne J and at 331, [134] per Callinan J, cf at 316-317, [86]-[90] per Kirby J; see also Condren; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) v R [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 577 per Kelly SPJ and at 591 per Dowsett J, cf at 585-588 per Thomas J.</text>

<tocase>Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26 ; (1985-1986) 160 CLR 392</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The test to be applied by a court upon a reference under s 672A(a) and its analogues in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial: Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35 ; (1988-1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273 per Mason CJ (Mickelberg). That test, as Mason CJ noted in Mickelberg , is derived from views expressed by four of the judges in Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26 ; (1985-1986) 160 CLR 392 (Gallagher). Of these, it is worthy of note in the present context that, in so concluding as to the nature of the relevant test, Gibbs CJ observed (at 399) that, "it is too severe, and indeed speculative, a test to require that the court should grant a new trial only if it concludes that the fresh evidence was likely to have produced a different result, in the sense that it would probably have done so." Also worthy of note in the present context is a further observation of Mason CJ in his judgment in Mickelberg (at 272) in respect of the reference in that case that it indicated "the existence of public concern about the propriety of the convictions".

Having regard to what was said in Mickelberg and Gallagher , described above, as to the basis upon which an appellate court on a reference will set aside a conviction, the words emphasised overstate the position. Evidence which is "fresh and compelling" may very well persuade an appellate court not only to set aside a conviction but also not to order a retrial and perhaps to order the entry of an acquittal. However, to secure the setting aside of a conviction, it is enough that the appellate court, considering the case as a whole, concludes that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant.

It is true that, earlier in his reasons, the Minister expresses the opinion that, "I consider it appropriate to refer a case to the Court of Appeal where the material presented raises a doubt or question about the conviction or sentence." Read in isolation, that might be thought to posit a test not materially different to that adopted in Mickelberg and Gallagher . As to that though, the Minister is not performing the function of an appellate court, only exercising a discretion as to whether or not there is a case which warrants referral to such a court. His role is to determine whether the applicant has presented a case in which it is reasonably arguable that an appellate court, applying the test in those cases and upon a consideration of the whole of the case, would set aside the conviction. That is a lesser threshold.</text>

<tocase>Horwitz v Connor [1908] HCA 33 ; (1908) 6 CLR 38</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1908/33.html</AustLII>
<text>The discretion conferred by s 68 of the Judiciary Act by applying s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code is a statutory adjunct to a prerogative of mercy. The prerogative forms part of the executive power of the Commonwealth but, as applied by s 68, the power exercised by the Court of Appeal upon a reference under s 672A is an exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth pursuant to a conferral of federal jurisdiction on that court for that purpose by s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act . It is consistent with the views expressed by Lander J in Eastman v A-G (ACT) to regard a Ministerial decision as to whether to engage that statutory adjunct as amenable to judicial review even if, as Horwitz v Connor [1908] HCA 33 ; (1908) 6 CLR 38 would bind me to hold, a decision to refuse a pardon is not itself reviewable.

For completeness, reference should be made to von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110 in which a conception that the feature that the referral power was an adjunct to the prerogative of mercy led a Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court to hold that a Minister's decision not to refer a case to the Full Court pursuant to that State's analogue of s 672A, s 369(a) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), was not amenable to judicial review. Given that conception, Horwitz v Connor was considered to dictate that result. von Einem v Griffin was not a case where the judicial review application was made under an equivalent of the ADJR Act. In this case though, the view is open that, insofar as he refused to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, the Minister made a decision: under an enactment, namely s 68 of the Judiciary Act , which rendered applicable s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code ; of an administrative character; and accordingly one to which the ADJR Act applies. 
 von Einem v Griffin is, for this reason alone, distinguishable. Further, as the Court's jurisdiction is sufficiently invoked by the reliance on the ADJR Act, it is unnecessary to decide whether an alternative basis for a judicial review jurisdiction exists having regard to s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act and given that the decision is one made under statute by an officer of the Commonwealth. Though Perrier v Kerr , Pepper v Attorney-General (Qld) [No 2] and Eastman v A-G (ACT) are not, strictly, binding, I ought to follow them unless, which is not the case here, I am convinced that they are clearly in error.</text>

<tocase>Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68 ; (2005) 224 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/68.html</AustLII>
<text>In Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68 ; (2005) 224 CLR 125 ( Mallard's Case) at [4] Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ observed of the Western Australian equivalent of s 672A: 
 [4] Provision for the referral of petitions for clemency to the courts owes its modern origin to public adverse reaction to the excessive imposition of capital punishment in the nineteenth and earlier centuries. As the capital statutes were repealed so as to apply the death penalty to fewer offences, appeals for pardons to the Crown tended to be made in cases of asserted miscarriages of justice, despite the anomaly to which a successful petition might give rise, that a person who has in fact come to be considered to have been wrongly convicted or innocent, is pardoned, and not acquitted of the crime. The importance of this avenue of recourse to justice, effectively controlled by the Executive, declined, after the introduction of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (UK) to establish the Court of Criminal Appeal, although no attempt was made to abolish it. It proved fortunate that this was so because there was, initially at least, a judicial reluctance to allow appeals in criminal cases, occasioned in part no doubt by the sanctity accorded, and usually desirably so, to the verdict of a jury, and less desirably, to the legal conservatism of some of the judiciary of the day.

Mallard's Case is also important for present purposes because of the emphasis given (at [10]) by Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in their joint judgment to the need for an appeal court on a reference under s 672A(a) to adhere to the letter and spirit of the words "the whole case" when determining a reference: 
 [The] explicit reference to "the whole case" conveys no hint of any inhibition upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal on a reference. Indeed, to the contrary, the words "the whole case" embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether "new", "fresh" or previously adduced, in the case against, and the case for the appellant.

Another concern arises from the following passages in the Minister's reasons, "The majority of the claims raised in the application were considered at trial or on appeal" and, in respect of "Ground 2", "Even without the material provided in the application, the jury seems to have been well aware that the defence questioned the accuracy of [the complainant's] evidence and argued that the trip actually occurred in August 2001." So much may be accepted, but those claims were not considered against the additional background of the further evidence provided by the Applicant in his application to the Minister. Immediately after the passage from the joint judgement of Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mallard's Case (at [10]) which I have quoted above (at para 48) their Honours further observe: 
 That does not mean that the Court may not, if it think it useful, derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some, or all of the matters before it, but under no circumstances can it relieve it of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case. The history, as we have already mentioned, points in the same direction. The inhibitory purpose and effect of the words "as if it were an appeal" are merely to confine the Court to the making of orders, and the following of procedures apposite to an appeal, and further, and perhaps most relevantly, to require the Court to consider whether the overall strength of the prosecution case requires the Court to apply the proviso contained in s 689(1) of the Criminal Code . [Emphasis added]

Paragraphs [49] and [53] of the judgment delivered by McMurdo P in the Applicant's unsuccessful appeal, quoted above, highlight that evidence which the complainant and the Applicant gave at the trial as to the number of flights undertaken with each other, when and for what purpose, were before the jury to evaluate in an assessment of the their respective credibility and on the then state of their and other evidence. What was not before the jury or the Court of Appeal was the further evidence which formed part of the Applicant's submission to the Minister. Further, para [53] of the judgment also shows that the absence of contemporary corroboration of the Applicant's log book entries was recognised as a factor which need not have compelled the acceptance of the veracity of those entries. On a reference under s 672A that on the Applicant's earlier appeal the log book had been dealt with in this fashion might, when considering the whole of the case, which would include the PNGCAA material, be thought to raise a stronger interrogative note concerning the relative credibility of the Applicant and the complainant. The enhanced corroboration of other aspects of the Applicant's account of events offered by the other evidence might perhaps also be similarly viewed. Be this as it may, what can be said, having regard to this further observation in Mallard's Case , is that in deciding whether or not there is a reasonably arguable case advanced that on a reference an appellate court would conclude that there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant, it does not follow that because, having regard to the then state of the evidence, an appeal against conviction was dismissed, like claims made against a broader evidentiary background must necessarily meet the same fate. The passage quoted from the Minister's reasons evidences a misunderstanding of the role of the Court of Appeal on a reference under s 672A.

Of course, as McMurdo P was astute to point out in her judgment, the question before the jury at the Applicant's trial was not whether or not the complainant was mistaken as to the number of flights to Port Moresby she undertook with the Applicant, when and for what purposes. It was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt on admissible evidence that the Applicant had committed the offence charged. Nonetheless, an assessment as to whether the offence had been so proved very much depended in the circumstances of this case on questions of credibility. What the Minister has not considered is whether on the whole of the evidence, as it now stands, the Applicant has presented an arguable case on the authorities for the setting aside of the conviction.

A further concern is that the Minister has been dismissive of the Applicant's request for a reference on the basis that the evidence was not "fresh". Having regard to what was said in Daly's Case, Condren's Case and Mallard's Case, that new evidence contained in a request for a reference under s 672A might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial and therefore not strictly "fresh" does not mean that the Court of Appeal on a reference could not receive it as a matter of discretion. It is not even evident from the Minister's reasons whether, in referring to an absence of fresh evidence, the Minister is using "fresh" to mean that, though "new", it was evidence that might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial.

Such analysis as there is in the Minister's reasons of the particular evidence which accompanied the submission to him displays a misunderstanding of what amounts to "evidence", be it "new" or "fresh", as the following passage in respect of "Ground 1" reveals: 
 The information in the log book is the same as that in the document from the Papua New Guinea Civil Aviation Authority (PNGCAA). It is therefore not 'new evidence' as the information was before the jury when it considered the case. 

The subjects of when flights were undertaken and with whom were before the jury. At the trial, evidence on that subject came, inter alia, from the Applicant's oral testimony, that of the complainant and from the Applicant's log book. The PNGCAA documentation was evidence, was at least "new" and was never before the jury. These errors aside, the passage quoted is underpinned by the premise, erroneous on the authorities, that, because a subject was before a jury, that means that, faced with new evidence touching on that subject, an appellate court on a reference cannot hold, on the whole of the case, that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the "fresh" or "new" evidence been before it.</text>

<text>The test to be applied by a court upon a reference under s 672A(a) and its analogues in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial: Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35 ; (1988-1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273 per Mason CJ (Mickelberg). That test, as Mason CJ noted in Mickelberg , is derived from views expressed by four of the judges in Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26 ; (1985-1986) 160 CLR 392 (Gallagher). Of these, it is worthy of note in the present context that, in so concluding as to the nature of the relevant test, Gibbs CJ observed (at 399) that, "it is too severe, and indeed speculative, a test to require that the court should grant a new trial only if it concludes that the fresh evidence was likely to have produced a different result, in the sense that it would probably have done so." Also worthy of note in the present context is a further observation of Mason CJ in his judgment in Mickelberg (at 272) in respect of the reference in that case that it indicated "the existence of public concern about the propriety of the convictions".

Such considerations would not be exhaustive of matters to which the Minister might, without committing the error of taking into account an irrelevant consideration, advert in deciding whether or not to refer a case. Because, in making the decision, the Minister acts administratively, he might take into account material which would not be admissible on the consideration of a reference by the Court of Appeal. Thus, as for example, Mason CJ apprehended in his judgment in Mickelberg , he might note public concern as to the propriety of the conviction. His sources of information in this regard might, for example, be reports in the media, a petition presented to Parliament, a representation from a parliamentary colleague, or perhaps hearsay evidence as to the reliability of a complainant or other information in an application for a pardon which did not constitute admissible evidence which could be considered by an appellate court on a reference. None of these would though be considerations that he was obliged to take into account, ie "relevant considerations".

Having regard to what was said in Mickelberg and Gallagher , described above, as to the basis upon which an appellate court on a reference will set aside a conviction, the words emphasised overstate the position. Evidence which is "fresh and compelling" may very well persuade an appellate court not only to set aside a conviction but also not to order a retrial and perhaps to order the entry of an acquittal.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/33.html</AustLII>
<text>For the purposes of the particular improper exercise of power error ground specified in s 5(2)(b) of the ADJR Act, where a statute confers on an official a discretionary power to make a decision, a consideration will be a "relevant consideration" in relation to the making of that decision if it is one which by that statute the official is bound to take into account either expressly or by necessary implication from its subject matter, scope and purpose: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 33 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 1 at 39-40.

The Applicant submitted that s 672A did not authorise the Minister to act as a "gatekeeper", second guessing what the Court of Appeal might make of fresh evidence. The submission allowed that the Minister might refuse to refer an application which was obviously frivolous but that it did not authorise the ignoring, as was submitted had occurred, of the evidence submitted with the application to the Minister.

The Respondents submitted that s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code does not expressly specify any criteria as relevant to the exercise of the discretionary power for which that section provides, such that the scope of the discretion was unconfined save insofar as the subject matter, scope and purpose of the section dictated otherwise. So much may be accepted but it rather begs the question as to what is dictated by the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 672A? To answer this question it is necessary to consider in some detail authorities concerning s 672A and its analogues.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>Any consideration of the Minister's reasons must commence from the premise that they are meant to inform and are not to be read narrowly or zealously with an eye for error upon judicial review: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. Further, and with all due respect to its author, the Minister was confronted with an application which, even as it came to be amplified, was diffuse and, as the title "corrupt prosecution" might suggest, attended with large claims about a course of conduct in respect of the Applicant allegedly involving agencies here and in Papua New Guinea tantamount to a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The Minister's reasons take the form in which they appear because of an evident endeavour by him and those advising him to engage in an orderly way with the Applicant's application. I do not underestimate the difficulty which that presented in the circumstances.

The "conspiracy" aspects of the submission made to the Minister were supported by hearsay accounts of varying degrees of remoteness from various persons. Another part of Mrs Tapari's statement had such material in it. It is not necessary for the purpose of deciding this judicial review application to refer in detail to that part of her statement or to other hearsay accounts. The Minister could, in my opinion, have taken these into account in deciding whether or not to refer a case, but he was not bound so to do. In the form presented, this material did not constitute evidence to which the Court of Appeal might advert upon its consideration of the whole of the case. Likewise, the withdrawal of a separate charge in respect of a complaint by another person had nothing to do with whether there existed further evidence warranting a reference to the Court of Appeal. Grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Minister's reasons relate to these aspects of the application. Of the attached reasons, only grounds 1 and 2 appear to relate to the request for a reference under s 672A.

In my respectful opinion, the Minister's reasons demonstrate that he has applied an overly rigorous test in deciding whether or not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. Of particular concern is the following passage: 
 In the absence of fresh and compelling evidence casting doubt on your conviction, paramount weight must be placed on the decision of the court. As the further evidence provided in the application was not fresh or compelling it does not warrant further consideration of this case by the Court of Appeal. [Emphasis added]</text>

<tocase>O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>As already noted, s 68 of the Judiciary Act must be read subject to the Constitution : s 15A Acts Interpretation Act . While that provision of the Acts Interpretation Act has a purpose in preserving statutory provisions from invalidity by promoting their construction so as to accord with the limits of constitutional legislative competence, it also serves as a reminder that Commonwealth legislation ought not be construed in a way which ignores constitutionally permissible practices in the discharge of the business of the Executive Government. R v Judd [1919] HCA 9 ; (1919) 26 CLR 168 , O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1 , Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 , Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Doody [1993] QB 157 each offer an example of ways in which such practices have been taken into account by the courts in the construction of legislation and with regard to the validity of the exercise of powers by public officials. It is useful also to recall the following observations made by Gleeson CJ in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [15] [16] with respect to the provisions in the Constitution concerning the Executive Government of the Commonwealth: 
 For the framers of the Constitution to have descended into greater specificity would have imposed an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of inflexibility upon constitutional arrangements that need to be capable of development and adaptability. The deliberate lack of specificity is demonstrated by the absence of any reference to such prominent features of our system of democratic government as the office of Prime Minister, or the Cabinet. 

 
 The concept of administration of departments of State, appearing in s 64 , is not further defined. This is hardly surprising. The practices and conventions which promote efficient and effective government administration alter over time, and need to be able to respond to changes in circumstances and in theory.</text>

<tocase>Peel v R [1971] HCA 59 ; (1971) 125 CLR 447</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1971/59.html</AustLII>
<text>The High Court has observed of s 68 of the Judiciary Act that it is a "central provision in the administration and enforcement of federal criminal law" which "fulfils an important role in ensuring that federal criminal law is administered in each State upon the same footing as State law and avoids the establishment of two independent systems of justice": R v Murphy [1985] HCA 50 ; (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 617. To this end, s 68 has been interpreted so as to permit the Commonwealth Attorney-General to appeal against a sentence in respect of a federal offence in circumstances where under State law and in respect of a State offence such a right of appeal was conferred upon a State Attorney-General: Peel v R [1971] HCA 59 ; (1971) 125 CLR 447 ( Peel's Case ).

Section 68 of the Judiciary Act does not, in terms, refer to any Minister. Rather, it "picks up" provisions of State legislation, which may or may not themselves refer to a State Minister or other official, and applies them "so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth". In so doing, "the adoption of the State law must proceed by analogy", an observation made by Sir Owen Dixon in Williams v The King [No 2] [1934] HCA 19 ; (1934) 50 CLR 551 at 561, which commended itself to Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Peel's Case [1971] HCA 59 ; (1971) 125 CLR 447 at 469 and to Gibbs CJ, Mason and Wilson JJ in Rhode's Case [1986] HCA 50 ; (1986) 161 CLR 119 at 124; see also to like effect in that case the separate judgement delivered by Brennan J (1986) 161 CLR at 126-127.</text>

<tocase>Pepper v Attorney-General (Qld) [No 2] [2008] QCA 207</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QCA/2008/207.html</AustLII>
<text>An assumption that a decision by Queensland's Attorney-General not to refer a case to the Court of Appeal under s 672A was amenable to judicial review under that State's analogue of the ADJR Act, the Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld) (Judicial Review Act), underpins the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pepper v Attorney-General (Qld) (No 2) [2008] QCA 207 ( Pepper's Case). It was held that the State Attorney could not be ordered pursuant to s 38(2) of the Judicial Review Act (an analogue of s 13(4) and (4A) of the ADJR Act) to furnish a statement of reasons for the refusal. The basis for the Court of Appeal's so holding was not that the State Attorney's decision was not one to which the Judicial Review Act applied, but rather that it was a decision in the administration of criminal justice and thus, by virtue of the exemption for which s 31(2) and Schedule 2, item 1 of the Judicial Review Act provide, exempt from the statutory obligation to give reasons if requested.

For completeness, reference should be made to von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110 in which a conception that the feature that the referral power was an adjunct to the prerogative of mercy led a Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court to hold that a Minister's decision not to refer a case to the Full Court pursuant to that State's analogue of s 672A, s 369(a) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), was not amenable to judicial review. Given that conception, Horwitz v Connor was considered to dictate that result. von Einem v Griffin was not a case where the judicial review application was made under an equivalent of the ADJR Act. In this case though, the view is open that, insofar as he refused to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, the Minister made a decision: under an enactment, namely s 68 of the Judiciary Act , which rendered applicable s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code ; of an administrative character; and accordingly one to which the ADJR Act applies. 
 von Einem v Griffin is, for this reason alone, distinguishable. Further, as the Court's jurisdiction is sufficiently invoked by the reliance on the ADJR Act, it is unnecessary to decide whether an alternative basis for a judicial review jurisdiction exists having regard to s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act and given that the decision is one made under statute by an officer of the Commonwealth. Though Perrier v Kerr , Pepper v Attorney-General (Qld) [No 2] and Eastman v A-G (ACT) are not, strictly, binding, I ought to follow them unless, which is not the case here, I am convinced that they are clearly in error.

Section 672A was described by Muir JA, de Jersey CJ and Fraser JA agreeing, in Pepper's Case, [2008] QCA 207 at [11] , as "a mechanism which the Crown may employ so that the exercise of the pardoning power may be properly informed or so as to grant the petitioner, in effect, a further appeal". His Honour further stated (at [12]), "The issue to be determined by the Court of Appeal in considering a matter referred under s 672A(a) is the same as that falling for resolution on an appeal, namely whether there has been a miscarriage of justice".</text>

<tocase>Perrier v Kerr (sued in his capacity as Minister for Justice) (VG 865 of 1995, 17 August 1997, unreported)</tocase>
<text>Peel's Case and a later decision of the High Court in relation to the operation of s 68 of the Judiciary Act , Rhode v DPP (Cth) [1986] HCA 50 ; (1986) 161 CLR 119 ( Rhode's Case), proved influential in persuading Ryan J in Perrier v Kerr (sued in his capacity as Minister for Justice) (VG 865 of 1995, 17 August 1997, unreported) to accept the correctness of the position adopted by the parties in that case which was that the effect of s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 was to grant to the respondent Commonwealth Minister (notably not the Attorney-General), in the context of an application for a pardon in respect of a federal offence, the discretionary power to refer that application to the then Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court pursuant to s 584(a) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) in like manner to the power granted to the Victorian Attorney-General under that provision in respect of a State offence. There was no issue in that case that only the Commonwealth Attorney-General, as opposed to the respondent Minister for Justice, could exercise the power made applicable by the Judiciary Act . His Honour also accepted as correct the further position of the parties, which was that the decision of the Minister for Justice not to refer the matter to the Full Court was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act, even though a decision to refuse the granting of a pardon was not.

For completeness, reference should be made to von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110 in which a conception that the feature that the referral power was an adjunct to the prerogative of mercy led a Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court to hold that a Minister's decision not to refer a case to the Full Court pursuant to that State's analogue of s 672A, s 369(a) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), was not amenable to judicial review.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QCA/2005/162.html</AustLII>
<text>Further insight into the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 672A(a) is offered by another Queensland Court of Appeal decision, R v Daley; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2005] QCA 162 , and by earlier Queensland authorities concerning that section referred to by Keane JA, who delivered the principal judgment in that case (Williams and Muir JJA agreeing). His Honour observed: 
 It may be said that this new evidence might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial so that it would not satisfy the test for the admission of "fresh evidence" enunciated in Ratten v. The Queen [1974] HCA 35 ; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516, 517. However that may be, it seems that on a reference under Section 672A, the Court has a broader discretion to ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done. See The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566 ; The Queen v. Condren Ex Parte Attorney-General [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 578, 579. 

 
 ... 

 
 [The] issue was not whether Mr Daley's legal representation was incompetent. The issue is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See TKWJ v. The Queen (2002) 202 CLR 124; Ali v. The Queen [2005] HCA 8 ; (2005) 214 ALR 1.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QCA/2007/137.html</AustLII>
<text>To answer that question first requires an understanding of the case made against the Applicant at his trial, of the defence case and of the basis upon which his appeal against conviction to the Court of Appeal failed. These matters are comprehensively canvassed in the judgment of McMurdo P (with whom Holmes JA and Cullinane J agreed) in the disposal by the Court of Appeal of the Applicant's appeal against his conviction: R v Martens [2007] QCA 137. It would only add unnecessarily to the length of these reasons to recite all of what is there stated. Some matters, salient in light of the present proceeding, should be recorded.

That the complainant was under 16 years of age at the time of the alleged offence was uncontroversial, as were the facts that the Applicant was an Australian citizen and that he and the complainant were at least on some days, each in Port Moresby between the dates alleged in the indictment. Whether the offence was proved depended very much upon an evaluation by the jury of whether the complainant was to be believed in her account that the Applicant had intercourse with her while they were in Port Moresby. Her evidence was that she had twice flown to Port Moresby with the Applicant in 2001, firstly in March for the purpose of securing a passport to be used by her in later travelling to Australia for educational purposes and secondly, so she said, on a school day after her birthday (10 September) but before Papua New Guinea's Independence Day (16 September), the 2001 celebration of which in Port Moresby she stated she attended.

At the trial the Applicant mounted a concerted challenge to the complainant's credibility. His evidence was that there had been but one flight to Port Moresby with the complainant as his passenger. According to him, it was this trip which was made for the purpose of the completion of the complainant's passport application. Apart from his oral evidence to this effect he produced his pilot's log book in which was recorded but one trip to Port Moresby with the complainant, on 10 August 2001. A passport photograph of the complainant endorsed on the reverse with the date 16 August 2001 and a related photographic laboratory receipt dated 11 August 2001 featured in the defence case. The evidence tendered by the prosecution included the complainant's passport which was issued on 24 August 2001.</text>

<tocase>R v Wilkes [1770] EngR 34 ; (1768) 4 Burr 2527 ; 97 ER 123</tocase>
<text>The office of Attorney-General is an ancient one. It evolved because the Sovereign could not appear in person in his courts to plead cases which affected his interests. Hence a need to appear by an attorney: see The Hon LJ King AC, QC , "The Attorney-General, Politics and The Judiciary" (2000) 74 ALJ 444. Conventionally, in relation to the criminal law of a body politic which is a constitutional monarchy, the Crown has the constitutional responsibility for the prosecution of crimes with that prosecutorial function being discharged in the courts on behalf of the Crown by the Attorney-General: R v Wilkes [1770] EngR 34 ; (1768) 4 Burr 2527 ; 97 ER 123. In more modern times, there has been parliamentary recognition that a need for independence from political considerations in the making of a range of prosecutorial decisions is enhanced by consigning the tasks of making decisions in individual cases and representing the Crown in criminal cases to an official removed from politics; a Director of Public Prosecutions. Nonetheless, Ministerial responsibility for the administration of the criminal law and for the office of a Director of Public Prosecutions, in conformity with convention, is usually consigned to the Attorney-General. It is certainly possible to explain the Queensland Parliament's definition of "Crown Law Officer" for the purposes of the Queensland Criminal Code by such considerations. That might be thought to support the Applicant's submission.</text>

<tocase>Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1921/20.html</AustLII>
<text>I accept therefore that the decision made by the Minister is one to which the ADJR Act applies and that consequently this court has jurisdiction to review the Minister's decision to refuse to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. In so doing, it is unnecessary to decide and I refrain from expressing any view as to whether, were the Minister desirous of having the benefit of the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point arising in the application for a pardon (for which s 672A(b) of the Queensland Criminal Code prima facie provides) a need to read s 68 of the Judiciary Act subject to the Constitution (s 15A Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)) (Acts Interpretation Act ) would prevent the application of that part of the provision to a person who sought a pardon in respect of a federal offence. A concern would be whether that application would be prevented by the prohibition, arising from the interpretation of Chapter III of the Constitution favoured in Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257 , against the furnishing of advisory opinions in the exercise of judicial power in federal jurisdiction. That is a subject which may only arise, if at all, in the event not only that the present decision were set aside but the Minister (assuming he is the relevant Commonwealth Minister of State) were disposed to act under s 672A(b), rather than s 672A(a), of the Queensland Criminal Code . The request made by the Applicant in his application and the way it was dealt with by the Minister suggest that it was both intended to be and was treated as one made under s 672A(a) only. Was the Minister empowered to make the decision?

The Applicant's argument in respect of this issue was succinct but none the worse for that. There were officers of the Commonwealth whose title corresponded exactly with those State officers named in the definition of "Crown Law Officer" for the purposes of s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code . That being so, it was submitted that there was no warrant for applying this provision, pursuant to s 68 of the Judiciary Act , "so as [it is] applicable", to enlarge its application so as to embrace the Minister. To the contrary, it was submitted that, having regard to the sensitivity which might attend the pardoning of a person convicted after a jury verdict and subsequent unsuccessful appeal, the choice in the definition of the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions may not have been coincidental representing as it did the Crown's First Law Officer on the one hand and the senior independent officer holder charged with responsibility for prosecutions.

The Respondent's argument was rather more elaborate. Its starting point was Ch II of the Constitution . Section 62 of the Constitution makes provision for a Federal Executive Council. In turn, s 64 of the Constitution provides for the appointment of members of the Federal Executive Council as Ministers, "the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth", "to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish". Section 65 then materially provides that those Ministers of State "shall hold such offices ... as the Governor-General directs".</text>

That being so, it was submitted that the Minister was entitled to administer the Judiciary Act , which included the administration of s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code , to the extent that it was rendered applicable by s 68 of the Judiciary Act to the pardon application made by the Applicant.

As already noted, s 68 of the Judiciary Act must be read subject to the Constitution : s 15A Acts Interpretation Act . While that provision of the Acts Interpretation Act has a purpose in preserving statutory provisions from invalidity by promoting their construction so as to accord with the limits of constitutional legislative competence, it also serves as a reminder that Commonwealth legislation ought not be construed in a way which ignores constitutionally permissible practices in the discharge of the business of the Executive Government. R v Judd [1919] HCA 9 ; (1919) 26 CLR 168 , O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners (1983) 153 CLR 1 , Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 , Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Doody [1993] QB 157 each offer an example of ways in which such practices have been taken into account by the courts in the construction of legislation and with regard to the validity of the exercise of powers by public officials. It is useful also to recall the following observations made by Gleeson CJ in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [15] [16] with respect to the provisions in the Constitution concerning the Executive Government of the Commonwealth: 
 For the framers of the Constitution to have descended into greater specificity would have imposed an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of inflexibility upon constitutional arrangements that need to be capable of development and adaptability. The deliberate lack of specificity is demonstrated by the absence of any reference to such prominent features of our system of democratic government as the office of Prime Minister, or the Cabinet. 

 
 The concept of administration of departments of State, appearing in s 64 , is not further defined. This is hardly surprising. The practices and conventions which promote efficient and effective government administration alter over time, and need to be able to respond to changes in circumstances and in theory.</text>

<tocase>Rhode v DPP (Cth) [1986] HCA 50 ; (1986) 161 CLR 119</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/50.html</AustLII>
<text>Peel's Case and a later decision of the High Court in relation to the operation of s 68 of the Judiciary Act , Rhode v DPP (Cth) [1986] HCA 50 ; (1986) 161 CLR 119 ( Rhode's Case), proved influential in persuading Ryan J in Perrier v Kerr (sued in his capacity as Minister for Justice) (VG 865 of 1995, 17 August 1997, unreported) to accept the correctness of the position adopted by the parties in that case which was that the effect of s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 was to grant to the respondent Commonwealth Minister (notably not the Attorney-General), in the context of an application for a pardon in respect of a federal offence, the discretionary power to refer that application to the then Full Court of the Victorian Supreme Court pursuant to s 584(a) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) in like manner to the power granted to the Victorian Attorney-General under that provision in respect of a State offence. There was no issue in that case that only the Commonwealth Attorney-General, as opposed to the respondent Minister for Justice, could exercise the power made applicable by the Judiciary Act . His Honour also accepted as correct the further position of the parties, which was that the decision of the Minister for Justice not to refer the matter to the Full Court was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act, even though a decision to refuse the granting of a pardon was not.

Section 68 of the Judiciary Act does not, in terms, refer to any Minister. Rather, it "picks up" provisions of State legislation, which may or may not themselves refer to a State Minister or other official, and applies them "so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth". In so doing, "the adoption of the State law must proceed by analogy", an observation made by Sir Owen Dixon in Williams v The King [No 2] [1934] HCA 19 ; (1934) 50 CLR 551 at 561, which commended itself to Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Peel's Case [1971] HCA 59 ; (1971) 125 CLR 447 at 469 and to Gibbs CJ, Mason and Wilson JJ in Rhode's Case [1986] HCA 50 ; (1986) 161 CLR 119 at 124; see also to like effect in that case the separate judgement delivered by Brennan J (1986) 161 CLR at 126-127.</text>

<tocase>The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566</tocase>
<text>Further insight into the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 672A(a) is offered by another Queensland Court of Appeal decision, R v Daley; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2005] QCA 162 , and by earlier Queensland authorities concerning that section referred to by Keane JA, who delivered the principal judgment in that case (Williams and Muir JJA agreeing). His Honour observed: 
 It may be said that this new evidence might have been obtained with reasonable diligence prior to trial so that it would not satisfy the test for the admission of "fresh evidence" enunciated in Ratten v. The Queen [1974] HCA 35 ; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516, 517. However that may be, it seems that on a reference under Section 672A, the Court has a broader discretion to ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done. See The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566 ; The Queen v. Condren Ex Parte Attorney-General [1991] 1 Qd R 574 at 578, 579. 

 
 ... 

 
 [The] issue was not whether Mr Daley's legal representation was incompetent. The issue is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See TKWJ v. The Queen (2002) 202 CLR 124; Ali v. The Queen [2005] HCA 8 ; (2005) 214 ALR 1.

The "broader discretion" to which Keane JA refers in the passage quoted is a discretion possessed by the Court of Appeal on a reference under s 672A to receive and consider evidence even if that evidence might, by the exercise of due diligence, have been produced at the trial: The Queen v. Young (No 2) [1969] Qd R 566 at 571. In the latter case (ibid), the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal also confirmed a view which had been expressed in an earlier, unreported decision of that court to the effect that, because on a reference under s 672A the court sat judicially, not as an adjunct of the executive, it could only receive admissible evidence. I take that to mean that, though the referral discretion is an adjunct to an administrative power, if the discretion is exercised in favour of a reference the resultant proceeding in the Court of Appeal is judicial in character.</text>

<tocase>von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110</tocase>
<text>For completeness, reference should be made to von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110 in which a conception that the feature that the referral power was an adjunct to the prerogative of mercy led a Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court to hold that a Minister's decision not to refer a case to the Full Court pursuant to that State's analogue of s 672A, s 369(a) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), was not amenable to judicial review. Given that conception, Horwitz v Connor was considered to dictate that result. von Einem v Griffin was not a case where the judicial review application was made under an equivalent of the ADJR Act. In this case though, the view is open that, insofar as he refused to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, the Minister made a decision: under an enactment, namely s 68 of the Judiciary Act , which rendered applicable s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code ; of an administrative character; and accordingly one to which the ADJR Act applies. 
 von Einem v Griffin is, for this reason alone, distinguishable. Further, as the Court's jurisdiction is sufficiently invoked by the reliance on the ADJR Act, it is unnecessary to decide whether an alternative basis for a judicial review jurisdiction exists having regard to s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act and given that the decision is one made under statute by an officer of the Commonwealth. Though Perrier v Kerr , Pepper v Attorney-General (Qld) [No 2] and Eastman v A-G (ACT) are not, strictly, binding, I ought to follow them unless, which is not the case here, I am convinced that they are clearly in error.

These conclusions are, in my opinion, consistent with conclusions reached by Lander J as a member of the Full Court in von Einem v Griffin (1998) 72 SASR 110 at 138-140 concerning the analogous reference power upon the assumption (contrary to the conclusion he reached) that the South Australian Attorney's decision to decline a reference request was amenable to judicial review. His Honour stated: 
 Judicial review would only be available to review the decision whether or not to exercise the discretion and then the subsequent exercise of that discretion to determine whether the exercise of the discretion conformed with the policy scope and objects of the Act. 

 
 What, then, is the policy or scope and objects of s369. The section has no application unless a petition for mercy has been presented to the Governor. It therefore assumes that the Petitioner has exhausted all of his or her legal rights and that all appeals have been exhausted and the conviction and the sentence must stand according to law. 

 
 The section further assumes that there may be circumstances, notwithstanding that all appeals have been exhausted, where it would be appropriate to refer this matter back to the Court for further hearing as an appeal. In that respect the section perhaps contemplates that fresh evidence has emerged which might make the conviction unsafe or unsatisfactory. It also contemplates that perhaps a restatement of the law may require the revisiting of a previous decision or the conviction. 

 
 The policy, purpose and object of s369 is to ensure, so far as practicable, that no person is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. 

 
 The section has been included to allow for circumstances of the kind to which I have referred so that even if a person has exhausted all that person's rights of appeal, that person will not be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, if later circumstances show that the conviction should not stand for any reason including that it is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 

 
 It is within that policy and purpose that the Attorney General must act. When a petition is presented to the Governor and referred to the Attorney General apart from advising on the question of mercy, generally, the policy and purpose of s369 is to have the Attorney General apply his mind as to whether or not it would be appropriate to invoke the Court's jurisdiction yet again, notwithstanding that the appeal process has been exhausted, so that the Court may determine whether, in any way, there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to that petitioner. 

 
 The policy and purpose of this section is to require the Attorney General to apply his mind as to whether it would be appropriate to refer the matter to the courts in either of the ways mentioned in s369 in case there has been a miscarriage of justice. 

 
 Any matter relevant to the policy, scope or objects of the section. 

 
 ... 

 
 Did The Attorney General Apply The Correct Legal Test? 

 
 In considering the matters raised in the petition the Attorney had to adopt a criterion to determine whether the material provided could give rise to the invocation of either of the powers contained in s369. 

 
 He was advised that unless the material referred to in the petition raised a sufficient doubt about the correctness of the decision the appropriate response was to advise His Excellency that it was not proposed to take any further action in respect of the petition. In considering whether the material raised in the petition raised a sufficient doubt about the correctness of the decision he was further advised that the material would not raise such a doubt unless it appears reasonably possible that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

 
 The Attorney General accepted that advice and on the evidence acted upon the criterion to the extent, that unless the material disclosed the reasonable possibility of a miscarriage of justice his proper response was to advise His Excellency to take no further action upon the petition. 

 
 The plaintiff complained about the test adopted by the Attorney General which he said amounted to a misunderstanding of the legal principles involved in exercising his discretion under this section. Initially the plaintiff argued that the adoption of such a test was an error of law, but I think that it was otherwise said that the criterion adopted was so unreasonable that no sensible person could have adopted the test. 

 
 If the matter had come before a judge of this Court, after conviction and sentence, for the purpose of obtaining leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court, then the test which would have been applied by that judge was whether the ground or grounds of appeal, raised on the application for leave to appeal, were arguable. The plaintiff argued, on this application, that that is the test which the Attorney General should have asked himself in relation to the matters raised on the petition. It was said that to approach the matter any other way amounted to an error of law and was so unreasonable that no sensible person could have adopted the test. 

 
 Of course, the proposition that a ground of appeal is arguable begs the question: Arguable in what sense? It must be arguable that there has been a miscarriage of justice. 

 
 It is right, I think, as Mr Abbott submitted, that a single judge in this State will grant leave to appeal from a conviction or sentence if that judge is satisfied that it is arguable there has been a miscarriage of justice. 

 
 The practice book in this State (Criminal Law South Australia, Butterworths; Judge Lunn) states at para 7115.3: 

 
"The test for leave is whether it is at least arguable that the exercise of the trial judge's discretion has miscarried or there could be any real element of injustice to the appellant if leave was refused; McDonald v R (1992) 85 NTR 1." 
 
 
 In McDonald v R , Asche CJ relied upon a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Broadway (1957) VR 398 and concluded that on an application for leave to appeal the appropriate test should be 'at least an arguable case' (at 3). 

 
 Asche CJ, however, accepted that it was inappropriate in applications for leave to appeal to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria. He suggested that another test could be 'that some possible though real element of injustice might be thought to occur if leave were refused' (at 4). 

 
 He said that the purpose of a provision requiring leave to appeal is to discriminate between the obvious cases where it is clear that the appeal cannot succeed and to allow the others to go forward. 

 
 Accepting the decision in McDonald v R and the matters to which Asche CJ has referred, it cannot be said that the criteria for granting leave to appeal is necessarily appropriate in determining whether or not a matter should be referred to this Court pursuant to either of the limbs of s369. 

 
 There is a point of distinction between an application for leave to appeal and a reference under s 369. A matter which is being considered by the Attorney General under s 369 has already been the subject of appeal and all of the rights of appeal have already been exhausted. 

 
 In any event, it is not self evident to me that the test that it is arguable that there was a miscarriage of justice is any less onerous than the test asked by the Attorney General of himself, i.e. whether there was a reasonable possibility of a miscarriage of justice. It seems to me that the tests, in a sense, ask the same question. A point will not arguably show that there has been a miscarriage of justice unless there is a possibility that there has been a miscarriage of justice and, of course, that possibility must be reasonable.

What then of the Minister's consideration of the Applicant's request for a reference?</text>

<text>The office of Attorney-General is an ancient one. It evolved because the Sovereign could not appear in person in his courts to plead cases which affected his interests. Hence a need to appear by an attorney: see The Hon LJ King AC, QC , "The Attorney-General, Politics and The Judiciary" (2000) 74 ALJ 444. Conventionally, in relation to the criminal law of a body politic which is a constitutional monarchy, the Crown has the constitutional responsibility for the prosecution of crimes with that prosecutorial function being discharged in the courts on behalf of the Crown by the Attorney-General: R v Wilkes [1770] EngR 34 ; (1768) 4 Burr 2527 ; 97 ER 123. In more modern times, there has been parliamentary recognition that a need for independence from political considerations in the making of a range of prosecutorial decisions is enhanced by consigning the tasks of making decisions in individual cases and representing the Crown in criminal cases to an official removed from politics; a Director of Public Prosecutions. Nonetheless, Ministerial responsibility for the administration of the criminal law and for the office of a Director of Public Prosecutions, in conformity with convention, is usually consigned to the Attorney-General. It is certainly possible to explain the Queensland Parliament's definition of "Crown Law Officer" for the purposes of the Queensland Criminal Code by such considerations. That might be thought to support the Applicant's submission.</text>
