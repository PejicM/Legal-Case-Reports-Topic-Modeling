<text>In Banque Commerciale SA (in liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 Mason CJ and Gaudron J said (at 286 7): 
 
 The function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met: Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd (in liq) [1916] HCA 81 ; (1916) 22 CLR 490 at 517, per Isaacs and Rich JJ. In this way, pleadings serve to ensure the basic requirement of procedural fairness that a party should have the opportunity of meeting the case against him or her and, incidentally, to define the issues for decision. The rule that, in general, relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party's right to this basic requirement of procedural fairness. Accordingly, the circumstances in which a case may be decided on a basis different from that disclosed by the pleadings are limited to those in which the parties have deliberately chosen some different basis for the determination of their respective rights and liabilities: see, for example, Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 at 76; Mount Oxide Mines (1916) 22 CLR at 517-518.</text>

<tocase>Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>The consequences of contempt proceedings are grave, and potentially include fining and imprisonment. In considering the application of the civil standard of proof, Dixon J observed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 , 361-362, in summary, that:

In determining whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that HFAT has proven the facts it needs to prove, I take into consideration the matters required by s 140(2) of the Evidence Act as well as Dixon J's comments in Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336. What are the booking records the subject of HFAT's claim?

I understand that it is not seriously in dispute that booking records for HFAT existed or that HFAT had booking records. The dispute in this case is as to the composition and nature of the booking records the subject of this claim. Background

I understand that the general position and practice in relation to taking bookings for HFAT tours was as follows: Because of the onset of the "build up" and the monsoon season in northern Australia, the period from approximately November until March each year was off-peak season for tourists. HFAT did not conduct regular tours during this period. However tour bookings were able to be taken at this time in respect of tours for the 2009 tourist season (scheduled to begin around April 2009) by employees of the HFAT business, including Ms Chaloner. A number of tours bookings were recorded by Ms Chaloner and (apparently) Ms Shelley Ratcliffe between October 2008 and the end of January 2009 when Ms Chaloner left HFAT. As I have already noted, no evidence was given by Ms Ratcliffe in these proceedings. Bookings were made with HFAT for tours by tour desks around Australia (in particular Broome and the Kimberley Holidays) on behalf of clients and by individuals directly. Bookings were made by email and telephone. Ms Cummins gave evidence that when individuals made bookings directly with HFAT, they were required to make immediate payment in order for their booking to be confirmed (TS 22 June 2009 p 6 ll 31-36). I have already noted Ms Chaloner's evidence that when an individual customer booked and paid for a tour she would send the customer a confirmation email in respect of the booking and the day of travel. Usually, telephone bookings for HFAT tours were recorded in a hard copy diary acquired by the HFAT business, and an Excel spreadsheet on a computer (operated by Ms Chaloner). The relevant diaries were yearly calendar diaries. Both the hard copy diary and the computer with the Excel spreadsheet were kept at the HFAT office, located at Hangar 5, Broome Airport. Identification of booking records

Part A para 7(a)(i) of the Application identifies the booking records sought by the applicant as "the originals and all copies (whether in hard or soft copy) of all and any booking records for forward bookings of tours made by persons who booked tours to Horizontal Falls with the Applicant".

During the proceedings however HFAT's definition of the booking records narrowed. In HFAT's written submissions the booking records were more specifically identified as:

However in determining an issue on the balance of probabilities, as Dixon J observed in Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 "reasonable satisfaction" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences (at 362). As I have already observed, potentially many other people had an opportunity over several months to remove the booking records perhaps inadvertently, perhaps deliberately. There is absolutely no direct evidence before the Court that Mr Rhys Thomas took the booking records from the HFAT office in Hangar 5 at Broome Airport, only hearsay from Ms Bishop as to alleged comments by Ms Chaloner, which Ms Chaloner denies having made. The only basis on which I could find that Mr Rhys Thomas had taken the booking records would be on the grounds of speculation, conjecture, and inference. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities, particularly taking into account the material before the Court which I have already discussed, the seriousness of HFAT's allegations, and the gravity of the consequences should Mr Rhys Thomas fail to (or be unable to) comply with an order as sought by HFAT, that Mr Rhys Thomas removed the relevant booking records. Form of Order

On the facts of this case HFAT has not substantiated its claims against Mr Rhys Thomas in respect of his alleged removal of HFAT booking records from the HFAT office. It follows that the Application against him so far as concerns Pt A para 7 should be dismissed.

While HFAT conceded that there was no basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to the relief sought by HFAT pursuant to Pt A para 7 of the Application, HFAT also submitted that:

In my view however there is no basis for adjourning the case against Mr Troy Thomas, because:

Accordingly, it follows that the appropriate order is to dismiss HFAT's claim against Mr Troy Thomas so far as concerns Pt A para 7 of the Application. Concluding comments</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/639.html</AustLII>
<text>Indeed, Ms Chaloner produced evidence that she was suffering severe depression as well as anxiety attacks arising from her concerns about giving evidence in the proceedings. I reject the applicant's submission that her medical condition was "pure poppycock". However as my ruling earlier in these proceedings demonstrated ( Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas [2009] FCA 639) I was of the view that, despite these medical conditions, Ms Chaloner would be able to answer questions under cross-examination, and indeed she did so in a direct, detailed and honest manner.

Further, I accept Ms Chaloner's evidence as to the mode of taking bookings between October 2008 and January 2009 because it was, and always had been, her job to take bookings for the HFAT business. Indeed commenting in relation to the booking records and Ms Chaloner's practice of entering bookings into an Excel spreadsheet, Ms Cummins conceded: 
 
 It was her (that is, Ms Chaloner's) system; nobody else really understood it.
 (TS 22 June 2009 p 8 l 40)

I make this observation, noting again the curious absence of any evidence from Ms Shelley Ratcliffe.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/569.html</AustLII>
<text>This is not a case where the legal issues inherent in claims of detinue, specific restitution, or pursuant to the Income Tax Assessment Act or the Corporations Act , were raised and litigated (contrast Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v MIBA Pty Ltd (1997) 150 ALR 633). It does not automatically follow that a claim for an order requiring the respondents to deliver chattels to the applicant introduced those causes of action to be met by the respondents indeed the pleadings equally support a claim for a mandatory injunction, or an order pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( Humphries v Halifax Vogel Group Proprietary Limited [2008] FCA 569 ; (2008) 76 IPR 144). Accordingly, even had I made factual findings in favour of HFAT on the issue of whether Mr Rhys Thomas had taken the HFAT booking records, I consider that a decision on the previously undisclosed bases submitted by HFAT after judgment had been reserved would be procedurally unfair.</text>

<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1984) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>In its Outline of Submissions in Reply, the respondents protested that to decide the application on one or more of the grounds raised by HFAT in its written submissions would, in the circumstances of the way in which HFAT conducted its case, constitute procedural unfairness as described by the High Court in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1984) 159 CLR 550 at 582-593.

In light of the parties' detailed submissions with respect to possible grounds for decision in this case, I make the following observations.

I consider that the respondents' submissions in this respect have merit. Nowhere in the application does HFAT plead the tort of detinue, the Income Tax Assessment Act , the Corporations Act or specific restitution. Not once during the course of the hearing were any of these causes of action raised by the solicitor for HFAT. The proceedings were not conducted on the basis that the respondents were required to meet a case in detinue, specific restitution, or based on the Income Tax Assessment Act or the Corporations Act .</text>
