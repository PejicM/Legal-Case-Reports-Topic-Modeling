<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats (2001) 208 CLR 199 </tocase>
<text>21 FKP submitted that the creation of intellectual property rights in contravention of the legal or equitable rights of a person can give rise to a constructive trust in favour of that person. Reference was made to what was said by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 246. In an appropriate case, so much may be conceded. Reference was also made to what was said by Williams J in dissent in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v United Aircraft Corporation [1943] HCA 50 ; (1943) 68 CLR 525 at 546.

23 Spirits submitted that FKP's motion for leave to amend its FACC by filing a pleading in the form of the draft SFACC should be refused for the following three reasons:
 
(a) FKP's proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out had it appeared in the original pleading; there were at least two elements to this an alleged mistaken reliance on s 44 of the Act and the absence of any pleading that, by making the trade mark applications, Spirits has invaded any presently existing legal or equitable right of FKP, or has breached any alleged obligation owed to FKP, such as would be necessary to attract any principle in the terms stated in Lenah Game Meats ;
 
(b) to allow the amendment would lead to substantial prejudice being suffered by Spirits which could not be cured by an order for costs, because registration of the trade mark applications would be held up indefinitely, pending the outcome of this (already lengthy and complicated) proceeding; and
 
(c) there are powerful considerations militating against an exercise of the Court's discretion in favour of allowing the amendment.

24 Each of these reasons was elaborated on in Spirits' written and oral submissions, but it is the reliance on s 44 of the Act in the pleadings which are at the forefront of Spirits' argument which is put in the following way.

25 Paragraphs [68] [70] of the draft SFACC, which lead up to para [71] plead that:
 
(a) the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are substantially identical with or deceptively similar to each of the Stolichnaya Label Mark, the Stolichnaya Word Mark, the Stoli Word Mark, the Ohranj Label Mark, the Ohranj Word Mark and the Blue Salyt Mark ('the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks') (para [68] of the draft SFACC);
 
(b) the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are in relation to similar goods to the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks (para [69] of the draft SFACC); and
 
(c) each of the Stolichnaya trade mark applications has a priority date which is not earlier than the priority date for the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks (para [70] of the draft SFACC).</text>

<tocase>SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd (No. 4) [2007] FCA 1025</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1025.html</AustLII>
<text>12 It is common ground that the requirements for the Court to grant leave to amend are accurately set out in a passage from SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd (No. 4) [2007] FCA 1035 at [14] [18] in relation to an application by Spirits to amend:
 
 
 '[14] The starting point is that all of such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided: Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 ; Dresna Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1537. Although O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') confers a discretion on the Court as to whether to allow the amendments, it is well-established that an amendment will ordinarily be allowed provided it can be done without harm to the other party which cannot be compensated by an award of costs or an adjournment: The Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 ; Londish v Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 470 ; (1993) 45 FCR 128. 
 
 [15] The overriding concerns should be to ensure that all matters in issue upon which the parties seek adjudication are determined in the proceeding and to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings: Caruso Australia Pty Ltd v Portec Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 40. 
 
 [16] Order 13 rule 2(2) of the Rules makes explicit reference to this principle: 
 
 
 
 
 'All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding, or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings.' 
 
 
 
 
 [17] The general approach is that where a party satisfies the Court that he or she generally desires to amend the pleadings so as to alter an existing claim or to introduce a new claim, leave should be granted unless the proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out if it had appeared in the original pleading or would cause substantial injustice which cannot be compensated for in the manner indicated in [14] above: Abela v Giew (1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 344 at 345. 
 
 
 
 [18] It is recognised that the allowance of an amendment before a trial begins (when there is time for a proper defence to be filed) stands in a very different position from amendment towards the end of a trial: Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd [1987] AC 189 at 220 per Lord Griffiths.'

13 FKP's constructive trust claim is pleaded in the following terms.

14 First, the trade mark applications are derivative of the currently disputed marks in that they incorporate the words STOLICHNAYA, STOLI or MOSKOVSKAYA, and are sought to be registered in respect of 'similar goods', within the meaning of s 44 of the Act, as the goods in respect of which those trade marks are registered.</text>
