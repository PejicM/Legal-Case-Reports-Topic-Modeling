<tocase>Bannister v New Zealand [1999] FCA 362 ; (1999) 86 FCR 417</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/362.html</AustLII>
<text>71 Thus a conclusion that it would be 'unjust' or 'oppressive' ought not lightly be reached. The entirety of the legislation and context suggests that such cases will be, to recall the language of the counterpart New Zealand legislation, compelling or extraordinary. (It is, in the context, and despite what are, to an extent, imponderables, an easier and more objective judgment to say whether it would be 'too severe a punishment' to surrender a person.) The authorities referred to by Sackville J in Venkataya and subsequent authorities including Bannister v New Zealand [1999] FCA 362 ; (1999) 86 FCR 417 and Kenneally v New Zealand [1999] FCA 1320 ; (1999) 91 FCR 292 require and confirm that general approach.

110 The Longman requirement is, in my opinion, analogous to the rejection by the High Court of 'representative charges' in Australia, considered in this Court in Bannister . In that case, it appeared that, in sexual abuse cases in New Zealand (as explained in R v Accused [1993] 1 NZLR 385 at 389) where the prosecution evidence:
 
 '... does not enable more particularity than that the conduct alleged occurred a number of times over quite a long period, such as a year or more ... the practice is to specify in [a] count [that] period ... and to allege a crime (eg rape or indecent assault) during that period ... To obtain a conviction the prosecution must then satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that at least one criminal act of the description alleged was committed by the accused during that period ...'

112 In Bannister the Full Court of this Court said (at [26]):
 
 'We conclude that it is appropriate, in considering whether, "for any other reason" it would be unjust or oppressive, pursuant to s 34(2), to surrender the appellant to New Zealand, to have regard to the quality of the trial which he would be likely to receive. Clearly enough, the standards to be applied to that issue are those which prevail in the Australian community. No court should be eager to pass judgment upon the process of another judicial system, particularly where the two systems share a common jurisprudential history and operate in societies which are, in many respects, similar. This is particularly so where, as in the case of Australia and New Zealand, the respective legislatures have demonstrated a clear desire to facilitate interaction at all levels. We do not suggest that criminal trials in New Zealand are generally more or less fair than similar proceedings in this country. However, on this very important procedural point, the two systems have diverged. In considering the present application, we can only apply the decision of our own ultimate appellate court. 
 
 
 
 We do not consider that every minor difference in procedure would justify our declining extradition. Such a step will only be justified if the procedure likely to be followed in the country to which extradition is sought will render it unjust or oppressive to surrender the alleged offender. In the present case, injustice or oppression must be measured by considering the High Court's view concerning the practice which will be followed in New Zealand, which view is that it is most unlikely to result in a fair trial. The High Court has recognized that some aspects of the potential unfairness may be avoided by appropriate directions to the jury but clearly, not all of the problems can be met in this way. For example, there is nothing in R v Accused suggesting how a New Zealand court will ensure that all members of the jury base conviction on any count upon substantially the same alleged conduct. This is not merely a theoretical problem, but a real danger in the view of the High Court. In R v Accused, the New Zealand Court expressly approved the direction given by the Trial Judge in S . The High Court clearly considered it to be inadequate. Thus we conclude that proceedings in New Zealand would probably take the form expressly disapproved in S .'

113 With unfeigned respect for those who decided Bannister , it concerned me at first that that case might need reconsideration and that I should perhaps refer this matter to a Full Court. However, on reflection it seems to me that, in the light of authority as to s 34(2) and the similar provisions as to interstate extradition formerly contained in the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth) , the approach adopted in Bannister of giving effect to strong and clear High Court authority as the measure of 'injustice' was correct, indeed inevitable. Further, the case is explicable as an instance of 'injustice' constituted not by some mere evidentiary or relatively important procedural divergence between New Zealand and Australian law, but as one of a fundamental difference as to the content of an effective right to a fair hearing, such right being recognised, as indicated above, as a basic human right.

114 There is no suggestion that, since the alleged commission of the offences complained of, either applicant has done anything further to bring about or contribute to the delays in the complainants bringing forward their allegations. They are not in the category of persons who have fled to a foreign shore to escape justice. They have simply lived their lives and lived them lawfully. Their ordinary service in the Order, operating as it does across Australasia, has brought them to this country. Nor have they contributed in any disentitling way to the delays since they were told of the allegations.

115 Under Australian criminal law and practice, it seems likely to me, on the scant material available, that there would be no joint trials in New Zealand as proposed by the prosecution. To begin with, there could be no joint trial unless the evidence from either of the complainants was admissible to prove the guilt of another. The most common way that such material is admitted is if the picture presented in relation to the two charges is so striking that it negatives the possibility of concoction by either complainant. It is not suggested that any of the acts said to have been committed by either applicant fall outside what are, regrettably, commonplace and unremarkable ways in which male children are sexually abused. Even if that hurdle be overcome, should the actual evidence exceed present expectations, the evidence would likely be rejected in Australia if there is a real prospect of concoction or of unconscious contamination. Given the circumstances in which the complainants have made their way to the police, it may be difficult to gainsay that prospect.

117 In New Zealand it appears that the test to be applied is whether the probative value of the evidence 'outweighs' any prejudicial effect: R v Holtz [2003] 1 NZLR 667 at 675 and that, in so determining, the courts consider whether there is a 'real chance' of concoction. I agree with counsel for New Zealand that such differences as may exist between Australian and New Zealand laws of evidence are not themselves such as to invoke the Bannister principle.

118 To the extent, as suggested by New Zealand, that the evidence may be cross-admissible to show 'context' ('to explain, for example, why no complaints were made', it was said) and that, for that reason, there is no requirement that the probative value of the evidence should outweigh its prejudicial effect, appears on the face of it far-fetched. I am unaware of any case where cross-admissibility of the evidence of different complainants has been judicially conceded for such a purpose, and it is not easy to see why such evidence would furnish any relevant context of that kind. In both New Zealand and Australia the long suspicion of the common law, for good reasons, of 'similar fact' evidence is likely to continue strongly to influence trial and appellate judges.

119 Finally, there would be a discretion in the trial judge to exclude the evidence if its unfair prejudicial quality might substantially outweigh its probative value: Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 101. The result of a proper exercise of that discretion would seem likely to dictate that the only charges against Moloney and McGrath that an Australian court would permit to be tried together would be those arising from the allegations of the one complainant who alleges that they were engaged in some kind of joint criminal enterprise against him. As indicated above, a high degree of prejudice would appear to arise from the joint trial of any charges involving separate complainants. As counsel for the applicant put it, there is a risk that a jury may reason along the lines: 'If only one of these people complaining had made the allegation we might well have a reasonable doubt about it, but as there are more than one making allegations, we feel comfortable about accepting all of them." Such would deny the necessity for separate considerations of an satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, an admissible evidence, as to each individual allegation, and above all of the credibility of the individual complainant. In Australia, as a matter of practice, an extraordinarily high, actual probative value would probably be required of the evidence of the other complaints. As presently advised, this appears very unlikely.

123 On such a practically important matter, an Australian judge or magistrate must view any difference between practices in the two national jurisdictions as tending, in some degree, towards injustice, given the likely consequences, and notwithstanding that, in themselves, the differences in the laws of evidence between the two countries would not attract the Bannister principle discussed at [110]-[113] above. For present purposes it is enough to say that the apparent possibility that joint trials might occur in New Zealand is a circumstance exacerbating the disabilities inherent in the applicants having to defend themselves so long after the alleged events.

131 This second aspect has also occasioned my anxious concern. However, as indicated above, I am not only bound by the approach taken in Bannister , but on reflection consider that the Bannister conclusion is inescapable for an Australian court, where there is a divergence between New Zealand and Australian law, however contestable, in a matter sufficiently serious as to turn the issue on the question of injustice. The divergence in my view, as to the Longman direction, does have that quality in the present cases. I see no way around this in New Zealand's favour.

132 Let me make it clear: my preference would be that the legislation should make it plain that New Zealand courts should deal with these problems and, in cases of such serious allegations, Australia should accept any degree of injustice to Australian judicial eyes that is not shared by our genuinely respected New Zealand counterparts: Australians generally would wish for the same degree of respect for our criminal justice system from the New Zealand parliament. But that is not what our Extradition Act says. It specifically envisages that there might be 'injustice' a broad concept in extraditing a person to New Zealand. It seems to me that, applying the Act according to its terms, the applicants have made out their case against surrender. Sackville J indicated in Venkataya at [163] that, if the result in that case was unsatisfactory, legislative change might be the answer. I venture to suggest that the outcomes in Venkataya , Bannister and this case, although regarded as necessary by the persons who decided them, may from a public policy point of view be less than satisfactory.</text>

<tocase>Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60 ; (2000) 206 CLR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/60.html</AustLII>
<text>83 The usual or 'presumptive' results of long delay are the possibility of honest unreliability on the part of the complainants, including possible unconscious substitution of an imagined reality for what actually occurred, the fading and loss of recollection of pertinent details by an innocent accused and the loss of legitimate opportunities to test the detail of allegations and marshal evidence pointing to innocence. McHugh J (in remarks later approved in Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60 ; (2000) 206 CLR 161 by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, said in Longman v R [1989] HCA 60 ; (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 107:
 
 'The fallibility of human recollection and the effect of imagination, emotion, prejudice and suggestion on the capacity to "remember" is well documented. The longer the period between an "event" and its recall, the greater the margin for error. Interference with a person's ability to "remember" may also arise from talking or reading about or experiencing other events of a similar nature or from the person's own thinking or recalling. Recollection of events which occurred in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and is also subject to the possibility that it may not even be genuine: ... 
 
 No matter how honest the recollection of the complainant in this case, the long period of delay between her formal complainant and the occurrence of the alleged events raised a significant question as to whether her recollection could be acted upon safely. ... Experience derived from forensic contests, experimental psychology and autobiography demonstrates only too clearly how utterly false the recollections of honest witnesses can be. Certainly, some incident or accumulation of incidents seems to have affected the complainant's attitude to her stepfather. She testified that, because of his conduct towards her in sexual matters, "I don't hate him but I do hate what he's done and the problems it's caused in my life". H owever, the existence of this feeling towards the applicant increased, rather than decreased, the need to examine carefully whether the complainant's honest recollection of events concerning the applicant was not distorted by this hatred. 
 
 To the potential for error inherent in the complainant's evidence must be added the total lack of opportunity for the defence to explore the surrounding circumstances of each alleged offence. By reason of the delay, the absence of any timely complaint, and the lack of specification as to the dates of the alleged offences, the defence was unable to examine the surrounding circumstances to ascertain whether they contradicted or were inconsistent with the complainant's testimony.'

104 I turn to what is, to my mind, upon reflection, an important matter. Under Australian law, there are quite specific safeguards required in trials of old allegations of the kind here in question. In such a case it is mandatory that the judge should give the jury a strong warning, not merely make comment, about an accused person's 'loss of those means of testing the complainant's allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay ...'. The High Court so decided in Longman [1989] HCA 60 ; (1989) 168 CLR 79. Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 91):
 
 'After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant's recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see Jago v. District Court of New South Wales..) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient.' 
 

McHugh J would have required more (at 108-9):
 
 '... the present case was one where the requirement of a fair trial required a strong warning to the jury of the potential for error in the complainant's testimony. The jury should have been warned that, in evaluating her evidence, they had to bear in mind that it was uncorroborated, that over twenty years had elapsed since the last of the alleged offences occurred, that experience has shown that human recollection, and particularly the recollection of events occurring in childhood, is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors, that the likelihood of error increases with delay, ... that no complaint was made to her mother, and that, by reason of the delay and lack of specificity as to the dates, the defence was unable to examine the circumstances of the alleged offences. ...' 
 

His Honour's suggestions were, as earlier indicated, approved by a majority in Crampton.

105 In Crampton Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said (at [45]):
 
 'The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. ... An accused's defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions . Almost all of the passage of the majority in Longman to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant's evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant's evidence), should have been put to the jury. Additionally, this was, in our opinion, a case in which the trial judge should, again with appropriate adaptation, when summing up, have drawn attention to the additional considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman: the abstention, by the prosecutor, from questioning each co-complainant about the respective charges, the fragility of youthful recollection, the absence of a timely complaint (subject to any reasonable explanation therefor) and the possibility of distortion.' (emphasis added)

106 Kirby J gave a detailed explanation of the kinds of disadvantages to an accused person involved where there is long delay (at 209):
 
 'The warning required by Longman ... must be related to the evidence and derived from forensic experience. The need for such a warning is demonstrated by the facts of a case such as the present. In practical terms, after twenty years, the appellant's defence could never rise much above a mere denial and protest of innocence. He had lost the chance of obtaining effective evidence from other children who were in the class at the time of the alleged offence concerning his alleged conduct. He had lost the chance of procuring effective evidence from other teachers said to have been coming and going near the class at times relevant to the events alleged. He had lost the chance of resolving, with certainty, the conflict of evidence about the nature and appearance, twenty years earlier, of locations relevant to the charges against him. He had lost the opportunity to collect forensic scientific evidence, such as was available in 1978, concerning the presence (or absence) of semen on the floor of the storeroom. He had lost the opportunity to respond effectively, by the testimony of storekeepers, to evidence that he had purchased lollies and other goods to favour the first complainant. 
 
 Twenty years after the alleged offence, the first complainant was an adult whose life's experience, character and motivations would have been unknown to the appellant. The appellant would thus be at a great disadvantage in testing events that may have affected the first complainant's recollection or reliability. Repeated answers to questions, searching the detail of the first complainant's testimony, such as "I can't remember" or "it's too long ago" made it extremely difficult to test that evidence in an effective way. 
 
 The idea that these serious disadvantages are unimportant and that the jury, unaided, will somehow sort things out by simply resolving the claims and denials in oath against oath must be firmly rejected. http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-23.108386.53949933563&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;parent=docview - 03-02526fn188#03-02526fn188 That idea is contrary to the repeated authority of this court in and since Longman. The jury need the assistance of the trial judge to warn, from the law's long experience, that trials with such potentially grave consequences for liberty and reputation need to be fought with forensic weapons. http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-23.108386.53949933563&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;parent=docview - 03-02526fn189#03-02526fn189 The passage of time -- especially great time -- may make it difficult, or impossible, to secure such weapons for an adequate defence. A jury may not understand this. A judge will. And the law requires that the judge warn the jury in clear and unmistakable terms .' (emphasis supplied)</text>

McHugh J would have required more (at 108-9):
 
 '... the present case was one where the requirement of a fair trial required a strong warning to the jury of the potential for error in the complainant's testimony. The jury should have been warned that, in evaluating her evidence, they had to bear in mind that it was uncorroborated, that over twenty years had elapsed since the last of the alleged offences occurred, that experience has shown that human recollection, and particularly the recollection of events occurring in childhood, is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors, that the likelihood of error increases with delay, ... that no complaint was made to her mother, and that, by reason of the delay and lack of specificity as to the dates, the defence was unable to examine the circumstances of the alleged offences. ...' 
 

His Honour's suggestions were, as earlier indicated, approved by a majority in Crampton.

107 Thus in Australia there is a guarantee that, if a trial of old allegations of alleged childhood sexual assault is not stayed, the difficulties faced by an accused faced in meeting accusations of conduct long ago will be mitigated by a 'firm and unmistakeable' warning to the jury carrying the weight of the trial judge's authority. There is no such guarantee in New Zealand. It appears that the courts of that country have set their face against following Longman : R v M CA 187/95 13 November 1995 .

108 It is not, of course, every difference between New Zealand and Australian criminal law that will justify the courts of one of them in regarding the law of the other as unjust. Indeed the courts should be chary of doing that, as the authorities I elsewhere refer to indicate. In many instances, reasonable minds may and do differ on what constitute the incidents of a fair trial. However, the matter at issue concerns the mitigation of likely actual disability for an accused person arising from long delays. The Longman direction is viewed in Australia as necessary to ensure that the accused gets a fair hearing by the jury. The Australian view is that there is a non-negotiable need to warn the jury of something crucial that they are likely not sufficiently to appreciate or properly to consider without that warning. In Doggett v The Queen [2001] HCA 46 ; (2001) 208 CLR 343 the High Court held (by majority) that a Longman direction must be given even where a complainant's evidence was corroborated, the prosecution case was 'in many respects a strong one' (c.f. [55] per Gleeson CJ) and experienced counsel had made no request for it at trial.

109 It seems to me that the requirement for a Longman direction is not something that any Australian judge or magistrate is entitled to view as other than a vital requirement for a just trial in a case of long delay. Upon analysis, because it deals with a particular difficulty the accused would have in having the jury understand his story, the necessity for such a direction goes to the right to a fair hearing. Such is, of course, a fundamental right recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III) of 10 December 1948) ('UDHR') and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (opened for signature 16 December 1966, 999 UNTS 171 (entered into force 23 March 1976)) ('ICCPR'), together often known as the International Bill of Rights. The UDHR provision (Art 10) provides:
 
 'Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.' 
 

So far as material Art 14(1) of ICCPR provides:
 
 'All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...'

110 The Longman requirement is, in my opinion, analogous to the rejection by the High Court of 'representative charges' in Australia, considered in this Court in Bannister . In that case, it appeared that, in sexual abuse cases in New Zealand (as explained in R v Accused [1993] 1 NZLR 385 at 389) where the prosecution evidence:
 
 '... does not enable more particularity than that the conduct alleged occurred a number of times over quite a long period, such as a year or more ... the practice is to specify in [a] count [that] period ... and to allege a crime (eg rape or indecent assault) during that period ... To obtain a conviction the prosecution must then satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that at least one criminal act of the description alleged was committed by the accused during that period ...'

131 This second aspect has also occasioned my anxious concern. However, as indicated above, I am not only bound by the approach taken in Bannister , but on reflection consider that the Bannister conclusion is inescapable for an Australian court, where there is a divergence between New Zealand and Australian law, however contestable, in a matter sufficiently serious as to turn the issue on the question of injustice. The divergence in my view, as to the Longman direction, does have that quality in the present cases. I see no way around this in New Zealand's favour.

136 There is however one aspect of possible oppression which deserves further discussion. It was argued that, despite the lack in New Zealand of the specific and important common law protection available in Australia constituted by the necessity for the Longman direction, there is at least a good chance that the New Zealand courts would consider that the combination of the detriments to the defence case from the long delay and the possibilities of unreliable if honest evidence that appear to exist, would warrant the trials being stayed. It is said that it would be oppressive to surrender the applicants only to see them not tried.

137 There are two answers to this. Firstly, I cannot foretell with reasonable confidence how New Zealand courts might react to the entirety of the material, including the actual witnesses' statements, that would be before them on stay applications. Secondly, there must be many cases in which people are extradited to New Zealand where, for one reason or another, the trial does not proceed. If it is not oppressive to return someone with a strong prospect of being actually found not guilty, it is hardly oppressive to return him even if he has a strong prospect of the proceedings terminating, for what may be less meritorious reasons, in a way which favours him.</text>

<tocase>New Zealand v Venkataya (1995) 57 FCR 151</tocase>
<text>62 In New Zealand v Venkataya (1995) 57 FCR 151 at 162-3, Sackville J provided some further background to the terms of s 34(2):
 
 'The language used in s.34(2) has its Australian antecedents in the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 ("the 1901 Act"). Section 18(6) of the 1901 Act governed the extradition of persons from one Australian State or Territory to another until the 1901 Act was repealed by the Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 , s.3. 
 ... 
 The three grounds specified in s.18(6) existed in the 1901 Act in its original form: Binge v Bennett (1988) 13 NSWLR 578 (NSW CA), at 584, per Kirby P. Unlike s.34(2), s.18(6) of the 1901 Act did not refer specifically to the lapse of time since the alleged offence was committed. However, the court's powers under that sub-section arose if, "for any reason", it would be unjust or oppressive to return the person to another State or Territory. 
 
 The immediate predecessor to s.34(2) of the Act was s.27 of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 ("the 1966 Act"), Part III of which dealt with extradition to and from New Zealand. The scheme of Part III of the 1966 Act was similar to that of Part III of the 1988 Act and was summarised by Wilcox and Jackson JJ. in Narain v Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 15 FCR 411 (FCA/FC), at 417 ( Narain v Director of Public Prosecutions was the subject of High Court proceedings, but on other issues: see Narain v Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 61 ALJR 317; 71 ALR 248). Section 27 of the 1966 Act read as follows: 
 
 
 "If a Magistrate before whom a person is brought under this Part is satisfied-
 
 (a) by reason of -
 
 (i) the trivial nature of the offence that the person is alleged to have committed or has committed;
 (ii) the accusation against the person not having been made in good faith or in the interests of justice; or
 (iii) the passage of time since the offence is alleged to have been committed or was committed; or
 
 (b) for any other reason.
 
 
 
 that it would be unjust, oppressive or too severe a punishment to surrender the person to New Zealand, or to surrender the person before the expiration of a particular period, the Magistrate may [order the person released or make other orders the magistrate thinks just]." 
 
 
 
 It will be seen that s.27(a)(iii) of the 1966 Act referred to "the passage of time" since the alleged offence, rather than the fact that "a lengthy period has elapsed" since the alleged offence, as does s.34(2) of the 1988 Act. However, I do not think that anything turns on this slight difference in language. The authorities construing s.27 of the 1966 Act, as well as those dealing with s.34(2) of the 1988 Act, must therefore be considered in construing the current legislation. The authorities construing s.18(6) of the 1901 Act are also helpful, despite the more significant differences in language. 
 
 It should be noted that, since 10 April 1993, extradition within Australia is governed by the regime created by Part 5 of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 . Under this regime, although there is power to consider the validity of a warrant and to grant bail, the magistrate has no statutory discretion to refuse to return the person apprehended to the place where the warrant was issued: ss.83 - 86 . It is of course open to Parliament to introduce a similar regime for the extradition of accused persons from Australia to New Zealand, but that step has not been taken.'

71 Thus a conclusion that it would be 'unjust' or 'oppressive' ought not lightly be reached. The entirety of the legislation and context suggests that such cases will be, to recall the language of the counterpart New Zealand legislation, compelling or extraordinary. (It is, in the context, and despite what are, to an extent, imponderables, an easier and more objective judgment to say whether it would be 'too severe a punishment' to surrender a person.) The authorities referred to by Sackville J in Venkataya and subsequent authorities including Bannister v New Zealand [1999] FCA 362 ; (1999) 86 FCR 417 and Kenneally v New Zealand [1999] FCA 1320 ; (1999) 91 FCR 292 require and confirm that general approach.

132 Let me make it clear: my preference would be that the legislation should make it plain that New Zealand courts should deal with these problems and, in cases of such serious allegations, Australia should accept any degree of injustice to Australian judicial eyes that is not shared by our genuinely respected New Zealand counterparts: Australians generally would wish for the same degree of respect for our criminal justice system from the New Zealand parliament. But that is not what our Extradition Act says. It specifically envisages that there might be 'injustice' a broad concept in extraditing a person to New Zealand. It seems to me that, applying the Act according to its terms, the applicants have made out their case against surrender. Sackville J indicated in Venkataya at [163] that, if the result in that case was unsatisfactory, legislative change might be the answer. I venture to suggest that the outcomes in Venkataya , Bannister and this case, although regarded as necessary by the persons who decided them, may from a public policy point of view be less than satisfactory.

138 However, the factors discussed in relation to injustice are also relevant to the notion of 'oppression' and I think that, collectively, they would also make it oppressive to order the applicants' surrender to New Zealand. In any case, as Sackville J said in Venkataya at 171:
 
 '... as the authorities acknowledge, there is room for overlap between the concepts of injustice and oppression; and the question is ultimately whether the whole of the circumstances render it unjust or oppressive to surrender the first respondent to New Zealand. The difficulties facing the first respondent in preparing for trial should be considered, together with the other factors to which I have referred, in determining that question.'

139 No lack of belief by the New Zealand police officers concerned in the truth of the charges was alleged. Nor is there evidence sufficient to establish conscious falsehood on the part of any complainant.

<text>116 The Australian standard should, I think, be regarded as set by the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) although Victoria and Queensland have each adopted their own and different approaches to the matter. Section 101 of that Act requires that 'tendency' or 'coincidence' evidence cannot be used against a criminal defendant 'unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant'. That is a less strict test for its admissibility than the Australian common law, which required that there be no rational explanation for the evidence except the guilt of the accused: R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319 ; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 at [95] . Now, a balancing exercise is required in each case: ibid . A serious possibility of concoction or unconscious contamination would still appear to be perfectly properly to be weighed in that balance. As McHugh J said in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7 ; (1995) 182 CLR 461 (at 529-530) (in dissent, but now, in my opinion, allowably as a useful guide see W v R [2001] FCA 1648 ; (2001) 115 FCR 41 at [102] ):
 
 'Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial. 
 ... 
 If the risk of an unfair trial is very high, the probative value of evidence disclosing criminal propensity may need to be so cogent that it makes the guilt of the accused a virtual certainty. In cases where the risk of an unfair trial is very small, however, the evidence may be admitted although it is merely probative of the accused's guilt. Each case turns on its own facts. But the judge must bear in mind that the admission of evidence revealing criminal propensity is exceptional. Further, as Lord Cross pointed out in Boardman , while there remains a general rule against the admission of other acts of misconduct, "the courts ought to strive to give effect to it loyally and not, while paying lip service to it, in effect let in the inadmissible evidence" . 
 
 Thus, where the prosecution case depends entirely on propensity reasoning, the evidence will need to be very cogent to be admitted. When propensity reasoning is relied upon, the danger is high that the tribunal will convict simply because of the accused's propensity instead of using it as an evidentiary factor. Consequently, in such a case the evidence will need to be so cogent that, when related to the other evidence, there is no rational explanation of the prosecution case that is consistent with the innocence of the accused. However, I do not think that evidence disclosing or tending to prove other criminal or wrongful conduct, and consequently the criminal or discreditable propensity of the accused, must always meet this high standard.'</text>
