<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82</tocase>
<text>The Court is entitled to decline to grant relief to a party in an application under the Act, even if an error has been identified: see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82.

As the decision of Ms Shipway to extend the time in which Ms Bitton could lodge her ultimately unsuccessful objection did not affect any substantive right of Mr Young, it appears to be futile to grant any remedy to Mr Young. It is unnecessary to form any conclusive view on this issue because of the Court's view about the lack of utility in extending the time for Mr Young to commence this proceeding. Decision on extension

The Court refuses to extend the time within which Mr Young's application may be made to it. I do not consider that it would be proper in all the circumstances for the Court to exercise its discretion in favour of Mr Young. Mr Young has shown no acceptable explanation for the delay in commencing the proceeding. The reality is that the extension of time granted by Ms Shipway had no continuing relevance for Mr Young until the Tribunal required him, in October 2008, to provide evidence concerning care arrangements in 2007. More importantly, the decision to extend time for Ms Bitton to object did not prejudice Mr Young because her objection was rejected. Ms Bitton had an entitlement to seek a merits review in the Tribunal and would have done so in response to an adverse decision of the Child Support Registrar whether made on 3 August 2007 or at some later date. An obligation cast on Mr Young by the Tribunal to provide evidence dealing with an extended period of time is not a sufficient basis upon which to revisit an administrative decision which otherwise has no practical consequences. It does not matter that there is little prejudice to the respondents. A quashing of the extension of time decision made on 3 August 2007 cannot effect the reality that Ms Bitton's objection was dismissed and that she has an entitlement to a review in the Tribunal. It is inappropriate to delay that review any longer.</text>
