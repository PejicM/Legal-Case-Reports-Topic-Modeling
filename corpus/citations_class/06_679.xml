<tocase>Expile Pty Limited v Jabb's Excavations Pty Limited (2004) 22 ACLC 667</tocase>
<text>23 Whilst costs normally follow the event the award of costs is almost invariably in the discretion of the court (see s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Order 62 r15 of the Federal Court Rules . See also Expile Pty Limited v Jabb's Excavations Pty Limited ('Expile') (2004) 22 ACLC 667 at 675 [33]).

24 In the foregoing circumstances the plaintiff instituted the current proceedings on 21 April 2006 with a view to securing the right to vote at the adjourned meeting of creditors on 23 June 2006 for an amount in excess of $1.4m.

25 By an amended originating process filed in Court on 11 May 2006 the plaintiff sought, inter alia, a declaration that the administrator's rejection or partial rejection of the plaintiff's proof of debt 'made on 7 April 2006' was invalid, an order that the plaintiff's proof of debt be admitted in full or, alternatively, an order that the administrator's rejection of the plaintiff's proof of debt be modified or varied so as to allow the plaintiff's proof of debt in whole or in part as the court may deem appropriate.

74 In FAI Workers Compensation (NSW) Limited v Philkor Builders Pty Limited ('Philkor') (1996) 20 ACSR 592, Young J, as his Honour then was, held that the prospect of a plaintiff securing an entitlement to costs in winding up proceedings under the Corporations Law did not enable such a plaintiff to contend that a contingent debt was payable by the company to the plaintiff in circumstances where, before a winding up order was made, the company was placed in administration and a deed of company arrangement was thereafter executed following a resolution of the majority of creditors of the company that it should do so. Such resolution had not been supported by the plaintiff. This decision is quite unexceptional and has no real bearing on the resolution of the issues in the present case. As his Honour said at 597:
 
 'As under s 466 there is a personal obligation to bear one's own costs of a winding up petition until the winding up order is made and then a statutory right to get costs which commences as at that day, it does not appear to me that a claim for costs before the order is made can be classed as a contingent debt.' 
 
 
 (see also Expile at 673-5 and McDonald at 474-5)

75 After referring to Philcor and Expile Barrett J said in respect of the costs of winding up proceedings in McDonald at 474-5 [45]-[46]:
 
 '... The preferable analysis ... is that it is the state of insolvency found by the court to exist that forms the basis of the winding up order. The applicant's debt is the source of the applicant's standing to seek a winding up order. That debt may also cause a presumption of insolvency to apply via the statutory demand process provided for in Div 2 of Pt 5.4 for the purposes of the winding up application. But even then, it is the court's positive decision that insolvency exists, rather than the particular circumstance of non-payment of the applicant's debt, that forms the basis for the exercise of the jurisdiction to make a winding up order.'

88 In Expile at 675, Palmer J distinguished claims for costs against a company arising incidentally to a claim for damages or other relief against wrongdoing from costs incurred in an application to wind a company up for insolvency. His Honour found it unnecessary to explore the nature of a costs claim against a company arising incidentally to a claim for damages or other relief against wrongdoing. However he did observe that substantive claims depend upon the existence of legal rights, whilst awards of costs are always in the discretion of the Court, even though the way in which the discretion will be exercised will be fairly predictable in most cases.

89 Palmer J addressed what was meant by 'future claims' and 'contingent claims' in s 553(1) of the Act. At 675 [37] his Honour said:
 
 'A future claim is distinguishable from a contingent claim in that, while both are founded on an obligation existing as at the commencement of the winding up ... a future claim will arise at some time thereafter while a contingent claim may arise. A typical example of a future claim is a claim for rent which will become due in the future under a lease which is in existence at the commencement of the winding up.' (emphasis in original)</text>

<tocase>Lofthouse, Re Riverside Nursing Care Pty Limited (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (2004) 22 ACLC 215</tocase>
<text>26 Upon the matter being called for hearing on 22 May 2006 the administrator sought and was granted leave to file in Court an interlocutory process in which he now seeks directions pursuant to s 447D of the Act as to whether in the circumstances of the making of the costs orders by the Full Court on 19 May 2006 he would be justified in admitting the plaintiff to proof for the purpose of voting at the adjourned creditors meeting in the amount claimed in the 'costs Proof of Debt dated 6 April 2006 or in some other amount.' (see generally Lofthouse, Re Riverside Nursing Care Pty Limited (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (2004) 22 ACLC 215 per Finkelstein J at [2] as to the effect of directions under s 447D)

27 In the light of the administrator's application the parties have agreed that both the plaintiff's application and the administrator's interlocutory application should be heard together with evidence in one matter being evidence in the other.

28 The parties have agreed that the issues now requiring determination are:
 
 
 (a) Whether the plaintiff's proof of debt should be admitted for the purposes of voting at the adjourned creditors' meeting on 23 June 2006 in respect of the costs of the earlier proceedings for which the Full Court's orders of 19 May 2006 provide, in addition to the amount of $1.4m (the First Question).
 (b) If the said proof of debt should not be so admitted, should an order now be made under section 447A of the Act which would cause the Act to operate so as to allow the plaintiff to vote in respect of its costs entitlement (the Second Question).</text>

<tocase>Brash Holdings Limited (Administrator Appointed) v Katile Pty Limited (1994) 13 ACSR 504</tocase>
<text>40 The 'creditors' who may pass a resolution of one of the types mentioned above at the decision meeting are not defined in the Act. The traditional approach has been to treat as creditors for the purposes of s 439C those persons who would be entitled to prove in a winding up of the company in accordance with s 553 of the Act (see Brash Holdings Limited (Administrator Appointed) v Katile Pty Limited (1994) 13 ACSR 504 per Brooking, J D Phillips and Hansen JJ at 513; see also Selim v McGrath ('Selim') [2003] NSWSC 927 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 537 per Barrett J at 554-5 and in particular [67]-[68]). Section 553(1) provides as follows:
 
 '553(1) Subject to this Division, in every winding up, all debts payable by, and all claims against, the company (present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages), being debts or claims the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant date, are admissible to proof against the company.'</text>

<text>40 The 'creditors' who may pass a resolution of one of the types mentioned above at the decision meeting are not defined in the Act. The traditional approach has been to treat as creditors for the purposes of s 439C those persons who would be entitled to prove in a winding up of the company in accordance with s 553 of the Act (see Brash Holdings Limited (Administrator Appointed) v Katile Pty Limited (1994) 13 ACSR 504 per Brooking, J D Phillips and Hansen JJ at 513; see also Selim v McGrath ('Selim') [2003] NSWSC 927 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 537 per Barrett J at 554-5 and in particular [67]-[68]). Section 553(1) provides as follows:
 
 '553(1) Subject to this Division, in every winding up, all debts payable by, and all claims against, the company (present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages), being debts or claims the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant date, are admissible to proof against the company.'

54 In Selim Barrett J observed at 548 [39]:
 
 '... there are significant differences between proof of debts and claims for voting purposes in relation to Pt 5.3A meetings and proof of debts and claims for the purposes of entitlement upon a distribution in a winding up.'

55 His Honour proceeded to deal extensively with the issue of 'Proof of debts in voluntary administration', 'Decided cases on regs 5.6.23 and 5.6.26' and 'Analysis of regs 5.6.23 and 5.6.26' in his reasons for judgment at 557-566 (see [78]-[106]).

56 The regulation making power contained in the Act is to be found in s 1364. That section relevantly provides as follows:
 
 
 
 '1364(1) The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed by such regulations for carrying out or giving effect to this Act. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may make provision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (f) for or in relation to the convening of, conduct of, and procedure and voting at, meetings of creditors, ... and generally regulating the conduct of, and procedure at, any such meeting; and 
 
 
 
 ...'

57 In accordance with the regulation making power, regulations have, relevantly, been made which are to be found in Part 5.6 of the Corporations Regulations 2001 ('the Regulations').

58 In relation to meetings of creditors convened under Part 5.3A of the Act regulations 5.6.12 to 5.6.36A are to apply to the convening and conduct of and voting at such meetings by virtue of subregulation 5.6.11(2). Subregulation 5.6.11(2) is expressed to be 'Subject to subregulation (3)'. By virtue of subregulation 5.6.11(3) the relevant regulations do not apply to meetings of creditors convened under Part 5.3A if the regulations are inconsistent with a particular requirement of the Act, the regulations or the rules [in this case the Federal Court Rules ].

59 Whilst regulation 5.6.17(1)(c) of the Regulations provides for meetings convened by administrators to be chaired by the relevant administrator 'or a person nominated by [the administrator]' it is clear that by virtue of regulation 5.6.11(3)(c) of the Regulations an administrator may not nominate another person to chair a meeting of creditors under s 439C of the Act. Section 439B(1) of the Act makes it clear that decision meetings, convened under s 439A, at which resolutions may be passed under s 439C, must be presided over by the relevant administrator.

60 Plainly, the Regulations cannot be used to determine what is meant by the expression 'the creditors' in s 439C of the Act. However under the Regulations the rights of creditors to vote at decision meetings may be restricted. Hence the relevance, in particular, of regulations 5.6.23 and 5.6.26.

61 In relation to the taking of polls at meetings of creditors, regulation 5.6.21(2) provides:
 
 '5.6.21(2) A resolution is carried if: 
 
 
 (a) a majority of the creditors voting ... vote in favour of the resolution; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the value of the debts owed by the corporation to those voting in favour of the resolution is more than half the total debts owed to all the creditors voting ... .'

62 In relation to creditors who may vote, regulation 5.6.23 of the Regulations relevantly provides as follows:
 
 
 
 '5.6.23(1) A person is not entitled to vote as a creditor at a meeting of creditors unless: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) his or her debt or claim has been admitted wholly or in part by the liquidator or administrator of a company under administration ...; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) he or she has lodged, with the chairperson of the meeting or with the person named in the notice convening the meeting as the person who may receive particulars of the debt or claim: 
 
 (i) those particulars; or 
 
 (ii) if required a formal proof of the debt or claim. 
 
 
 
 (2) A creditor must not vote in respect of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) an unliquidated debt; or 
 
 (b) a contingent debt; or 
 
 (c) an unliquidated or a contingent claim; or 
 
 (d) a debt the value of which is not established; 
 
 
 
 
 
 unless a just estimate of its value has been made. 
 ...'

64 As Barrett J observed in Selim at 558 [81]:
 
 'It is clear, despite these unqualified references to proofs being admitted or rejected [references to proofs in regulation 5.6.26], that a concept of partial admission of a debt exists.'

65 Subject to the foregoing observations the analysis of Barrett J in respect of proofs of debt for voting purposes in voluntary administrations as recorded in Selim and referred to above should, in general terms, be followed. Given their length they have not been repeated in these reasons.</text>

<text>41 When an administrator has been appointed to a company, whether followed by a deed of company arrangement or not, provable debts are those where the circumstances giving rise to them occurred before the date of commencement of the administration (per Cohen J in Re Crawford House Press Pty Limited (1995) 17 ACSR 295 at 298).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/2.html</AustLII>
<text>22 Prior to the administrator rejecting the proof of debt for voting purposes to the extent to which it claimed an amount in excess of $1.4m the administrator received from his lawyers a letter of advice dated 19 April 2006, which relevantly provided as follows:
 
 'The issue discussed at our meeting with the directors and Phillips Fox was whether ... the claims of EES and Caltex (to the extent that they have any claims) with respect to costs are debts/claims which are provable in any Deed of Company Arrangement that may be proposed. As we have indicated to you in our view they are not. 
 
 It is of course a matter for any party propounding a Deed of Company Arrangement to specify in the proposal the debts and claims of creditors which are provable in the Deed (see section 444A(4) of the Corporations Act ). Relevantly however section 444A(4)(i) states that the Deed must specify the day (being a day not later than the day when the administration began) on or before which claims must have arisen if they are to be admissible under the Deed. The word " claims " is not defined in the Act although the definition contained in 553 of the Corporations Act which deals with debts provable in a winding up is often used as the definitions in a Deed as to which claims are provable in the Deed. 
 
 Whatever definition of claims is incorporated into the Deed however it is clearly the case that the claim must have " arisen " by the time of the Administrator's appointment for the debt to be provable. The question arises whether the asserted right of Caltex and EES to the benefit of Costs Orders is a claim which has " arisen " as at the date that the Administrator was appointment (sic) . In our view the claims had not " arisen " at that date. 
 
 As long ago as 1899 the Courts had determined (in Bankruptcy proceedings see Re: British Goldfields of West Africa (1899) 2 Ch 7) that the legal costs arising out of Court proceedings are not provable unless an Order is made for the payment prior to the date of the winding up. The New South Wales Supreme Court recently considered this position when determining whether the costs incurred by an applicant in seeking to wind up a company are provable in a subsequent Deed of Company Arrangement in circumstances where no Order had been made for costs with respect to that application prior to the Administrator's appointment. The Court held that such costs were not provable in the Deed of Company Arrangement ( see McDonald v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2005] NSWSC 2 ; (2005) 23 ACLC 324). 
 
 The logic behind these decisions is that the award of costs is a matter which is wholly within the discretion of the Court. While in many cases it is fairly predictable as to how that discretion will be exercised (ordinarily costs follow the event so that the successful party would expect an Order to be made in their favour with respect to costs) until the Court actually exercises its discretion to make an Order it is wholly impossible for an Administrator or Liquidator to make an assessment that the discretion will be exercised in a particular way. 
 
 It seems to us this is particularly the case in the circumstances of this matter. The issue concerning costs is complicated. There are clearly complex matter to be taken into account in determining what if any Costs Orders should be made and it seems to us those complexities only reinforce the importance of the following the previous authorities and not allowing EES or Caltex to vote with respect to any amount they may claim for legal costs nor to participate in any distribution that may be under any Deed of Company Arrangement that may be proposed. 
 
 There have been cases which have considered exceptions to this principle. There is some authority for the proposition that contractual arrangements between the parties may alter the legal position. If for instance a party agrees in a contract to be responsible for another parties legal costs then there is an argument that the costs have arisen under that contract and so may be provable. In Re: Pasminco Limited [2002] FCA 231 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 782 considered whether costs associated with pursuing a personal injury action against the Company would be provable. The Court considered alternative views as to the nexus between incurring costs and obtaining compensation for personal injury but reinforced the general principle that costs are not provable in the absence of agreement to the contrary or an Order for their payment. 
 
 In all the circumstances we confirm that we do not believe EES and/or Caltex should be allowed to vote or prove for their legal costs. To the extent that an Order is made by the Court subsequently those costs will be claimable against the Company and it may be if Caltex and EES intend to pursue their claim for costs (if an order is made in their favour) that it is important for the purposes of any Deed proposal that the directors commit to continuing to resist the making of any Order for Costs and give some consideration as to how any Order against the Company would subsequently be funded. It seems to us little point in proceeding with a Deed of Company Arrangement if the commercial reality is that the Company will subsequently face insolvency by breach of its inability to meet an adverse Costs Order.'

42 In McDonald v Commissioner of Taxation ('McDonald') [2005] NSWSC 2 ; (2005) 187 FLR 461 at 472 [36] Barrett J noted that s 553(1) of the Act directs attention not to the time at which a debt or claim arises but to whether 'the circumstances giving rise to' the debt or claim occurred before the 'relevant date'.

43 In the Australian Law Reform Commission's final report, General Insolvency Inquiry (ALRC 45) ('the Harmer Report'), to which reference will be made hereafter, the recommended provision which ended up as s 553(1) of the Act, as set out above, was as follows (see Vol 2 at 151):
 
 
 ' C1. In the administration of a company that is being wound up in insolvency, a debt or liability, present or future, certain or contingent, being an ascertained debt or liability or a liability sounding only in damages, may be admitted as a claim against the company.'

44 Prior to the passage of the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) s 553 of the Corporations Law provided as follows:
 
 '553(1) In every winding up, subject in the case of insolvent companies to the application in accordance with the provisions of this Law of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , all debts payable on a contingency and all claims against the company (present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages) are admissible to proof against the company, a just estimate being made so far as possible of the value of such debts or claims as are subject to any contingency or sound only in damages or for some other reason do not bear a certain value. 
 
 (2) Subject to sections 206RD, 279 and 556, in the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors and debts provable and the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities as are in force for the time being under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , in relation to the estates of bankrupt persons, and all persons who in any such case would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the property of the company may come in under the winding up and make such claims against the company as they respectively are entitled to by virtue of this section.''

74 In FAI Workers Compensation (NSW) Limited v Philkor Builders Pty Limited ('Philkor') (1996) 20 ACSR 592, Young J, as his Honour then was, held that the prospect of a plaintiff securing an entitlement to costs in winding up proceedings under the Corporations Law did not enable such a plaintiff to contend that a contingent debt was payable by the company to the plaintiff in circumstances where, before a winding up order was made, the company was placed in administration and a deed of company arrangement was thereafter executed following a resolution of the majority of creditors of the company that it should do so. Such resolution had not been supported by the plaintiff. This decision is quite unexceptional and has no real bearing on the resolution of the issues in the present case. As his Honour said at 597:
 
 'As under s 466 there is a personal obligation to bear one's own costs of a winding up petition until the winding up order is made and then a statutory right to get costs which commences as at that day, it does not appear to me that a claim for costs before the order is made can be classed as a contingent debt.' 
 
 
 (see also Expile at 673-5 and McDonald at 474-5)

75 After referring to Philcor and Expile Barrett J said in respect of the costs of winding up proceedings in McDonald at 474-5 [45]-[46]:
 
 '... The preferable analysis ... is that it is the state of insolvency found by the court to exist that forms the basis of the winding up order. The applicant's debt is the source of the applicant's standing to seek a winding up order. That debt may also cause a presumption of insolvency to apply via the statutory demand process provided for in Div 2 of Pt 5.4 for the purposes of the winding up application. But even then, it is the court's positive decision that insolvency exists, rather than the particular circumstance of non-payment of the applicant's debt, that forms the basis for the exercise of the jurisdiction to make a winding up order.'

90 In McDonald , Barrett J drew a distinction between prospective orders for costs in winding up proceedings and in other proceedings. At 474 [44] his Honour said:
 
 'Where some act or omission of a company occurring before winding up carries within it the seeds of substantive relief in proceedings in which an adverse costs order is likely if the claim against the company is made out, the eventual liability under such a costs order may be seen to have its genesis in the original act or omission. But where the relevant proceeding is for a winding up order which does not, of its nature, entail substantive relief grounded in any particular anterior act or omission of the company, no such link is apparent.'

91 When addressing who may fall within the expression 'the creditors' in s 439C of the Act, it is important to note that there are distinct differences between the terminology used in s 82 of the Bankruptcy Act referable to the determination of 'debts provable', being the applicable section in relation to insolvent companies by virtue of s 553(2) of the Corporations Law prior to the passage of the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 , that used in s 553(1) of the Corporations Law at that time referable to the determination of debts and claims that were 'admissible to proof' against a solvent company that was being wound up, and that used in the current s 553(1) of the Act referable to the determination of debts and claims which are 'admissible to proof' against a company that is being wound up, whether solvent or insolvent.

92 Firstly, the Bankruptcy Act was concerned with debts and liabilities to which a bankrupt was subject at the date of the bankruptcy, or to which he may become subject before his discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of his bankruptcy. Section 553(1) of the Corporations Law, prior to its amendment in 1992, was silent in respect of any question of prior 'obligation'. It provided for 'all debts payable on a contingency' and for 'all claims' against the company to be admissible to proof against the company. Section 553(1) of the Act is concerned with debts and claims 'the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant date'.

98 To use Barrett J's expressions in McDonald , the eventual liability of Charben under the costs orders of the Full Court made on 19 May 2006, following the appointment of Charben's administrator on 31 March 2006, had its 'genesis' in the judgment of the Full Court in the plaintiff's favour, handed down on 22 December 2005. One could also say that 'the seeds' of the costs orders were the circumstances occurring before 31 March 2006, namely the delivery of the judgment in the plaintiff's favour on 22 December 2005.

99 In my opinion the plaintiff had, as at the date of the appointment of the administrator to Charben, a present claim for costs to which s 553(1) of the Act applied. Accordingly, subject to compliance with the regulations, the plaintiff would be entitled to vote at the adjourned decision meeting under s 439A-439C of the Act on Friday 23 June 2006 as a creditor of Charben in respect of both the debt of $1.4m which has already been admitted and also in respect of the plaintiff's costs and disbursements.</text>

<tocase>In re British Goldfields of West Africa [1899] 2 Ch 7</tocase>
<text>66 In re British Goldfields of West Africa ('British Goldfields') [1899] 2 Ch 7 is not authority for the proposition for which it was cited by the administrator's solicitors in their letter of advice of 19 April 2006.

67 That case concerned the winding up of a company to which s 37 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 52) of the United Kingdom applied by virtue of s 10 of the Judicature Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77). Section 37 was expressed in terms quite different from s 553(1) of the Act. It relevantly provided:
 
 
 '37(1) Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise, or breach of trust, shall not be provable in bankruptcy. 
 ... 
 (3) Save as aforesaid, all debts and liabilities, present or future, certain or contingent, to which the debtor is subject at the date of the receiving order, or to which he may become subject before his discharge by reason of any obligation incurred before the date of the receiving order, shall be deemed to be debts provable in bankruptcy.'

68 The Court of Appeal, comprising Lindley MR, Rigby and Collins LJJ, enunciated certain rules in respect of provable debts which were applicable in the context of the relevant statutory framework then applying to companies that were being wound up in the United Kingdom. These included at 11:
 
 '...if an unsuccessful action is brought by a man who becomes bankrupt, then, if he is ordered to pay the costs, or if a verdict is given against him before he becomes bankrupt, they [referring to the costs] are provable .... On the other hand, if no verdict is given against him and no order is made for payment of costs until after he becomes bankrupt, they are not provable. In such a case there is no provable debt to which the costs are incident, and there is no liability to pay them by reason of any obligation incurred by the bankrupt before bankruptcy; nor are they a contingent liability to which he can be said to be subject at the date of his bankruptcy. ...' (emphasis added)

69 In British Goldfields a number of shareholders applied to have their names removed from the register of members and for repayment by the company of the amounts they had respectively paid for their shares, on the ground of misrepresentation in the prospectus. The applications of two of the shareholders were heard which resulted in orders in favour of the shareholders and orders that their costs be paid. The other applications were stood over until after the first two were disposed of, but there was no order that they should abide the result of the two which were decided and there was no order as to the costs of those which were stood over. After the applications which were heard had been decided favourably to the two applicants and before anything more was done with the other applicants, the company was ordered to be wound up. Shortly thereafter the other applicants sought leave to proceed with their applications and liberty to prove for the amounts which they sought to recover and also for their costs. Their right to be removed from the register and to prove for the amounts which had been paid for their shares was not contested. An order for rectification of the register was made accordingly. However the official receiver/liquidator refused to allow the other applicants to prove for their costs against the company. Even though no orders had been made for the other applicants' costs, it was held that they were entitled to prove for such costs. The Court said at 12:
 
 'The register having been rectified, the sums paid by the applicants are clearly provable debts, and the costs of rectifying the register are costs of obtaining an order without which these debts cannot be recovered or admitted to proof. The costs are therefore properly added to the debts provable.'

70 Had the same statutory regime which applied in British Goldfields applied in the circumstances of the present case it could be said, by analogy, that the appeal having succeeded, the sum of $1.4m paid by the plaintiff to Charben was clearly a provable debt, and further that the costs of the appeal, at least, were the costs of obtaining an order without which the debt of $1.4m could not be recovered or admitted to proof. The costs of the appeal were therefore properly added to the debts provable.

86 Pasminco may be distinguished from the present case in that the legal costs and expenses, which Goldberg J held were admissible to proof as contingent claims, were costs and expenses in relation to claims for injury compensation against the relevant Pasminco companies which had not, at the time of the appointment of the administrators, proceeded to judgment against those companies. The relevant principles in relation to such a situation, as enunciated by Lindley MR in British Goldfields at 11, applying the then s 37(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (UK), were as follows:
 
 'If an action is brought against a person, who afterwards becomes bankrupt, for the recovery of a sum of money, and the action is successful, the costs are regarded as an addition to the sum recovered and to be provable if that is provable, but not otherwise. 
 
 If, therefore, what is recovered is unliquidated damages "arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise, or breach of trust," that sum is not recoverable unless judgment, or at least a verdict for it, has been obtained before adjudication, or now the receiving order; and if the sum recovered is not provable, neither are the costs of recovering it: In re Newman; Re Bluck. On the other hand, if what is recovered is provable, so are the costs of recovering it: see Emma Silver Mining Co. v. Grant. ' (footnotes omitted)

87 The criticism, by way of obiter, of the decision of Goldberg J in Pasminco , by Finkelstein J in McLellan v Australian Stock Exchange Limited ('McLellan') [2005] FCA 585 ; (2005) 144 FCR 327 at 331-3 [12] - [17] may require further consideration in the light of the matters recorded in these reasons with respect to the relevant statutory framework now prevailing as noted under the heading '"Creditors" for the purpose of Part 5.3A decision meetings '. So also the criticism by Chesterman J of the proposition for which Emma Silver Mining Co v Grant (1880) 17 ChD 122 was cited as authority in British Goldfields , in Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Limited v Ensham Resources Pty Limited [2006] QSC 7 at [27] - [35] .

100 It seems to me that this conclusion is generally in sympathy with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in British Goldfields.

101 Charben's administrator should admit the plaintiff's claim for voting purposes in respect of that part of the plaintiff's claim for costs and disbursements as represents two-thirds of the amount claimed by the plaintiff, in respect of the trial and the appeal, subject, in the case of the costs and disbursements on the appeal to a reduction of 20% in the amount so claimed.

102 In my opinion, an amount so determined would constitute a just estimate of the value of the plaintiff's unliquidated claim for costs and disbursements in respect of the earlier proceedings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1969/47.html</AustLII>
<text>71 In Community Development Pty Limited v Engwirda Construction Company ('Engwirda') [1969] HCA 47 ; (1966) 120 CLR 455 at 459, Kitto J made the following observations in respect of what is meant by the expression 'contingent creditor':
 
 'Not much assistance is to be gained, I think, from observations that are to be found in reported cases as to the import of the word "contingent", and I shall refer to one only. In In re William Hockley Ltd ... Pennycuick J. suggested as a definition of "a contingent creditor" what is perhaps rather a definition of "a contingent or prospective creditor", saying that in his opinion it denoted "a person towards whom, under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability upon the happening of some future event or at some future date". The importance of these words for present purposes lies in their insistence that there must be an existing obligation and that out of that obligation a liability on the part of the company to pay a sum of money will arise in a future event, whether it be an event that must happen or only an event that may happen. A building contract creates, as soon as it is entered into, an obligation upon the building owner to pay the contract price, either as a whole upon a future event or, more usually, by progress and final payments each of which is to be made on a future event. The event or events may not happen, but if and when one of them does happen the building owner, by force of the contractual obligation, must pay the builder a sum of money. It is, I think, nothing to the point that the event may be complex, as where the payment is agreed to be made when the whole or some part of the work has been done to the satisfaction of an architect as expressed in a certificate or to the satisfaction of an arbitrator as expressed in an award: the building owner is bound from the time the contract is made to pay money to the builder upon a contingency; and that in my opinion makes the builder a contingent creditor of the owner.'

72 Barwick CJ agreed with the observations of Kitto J and, inferentially, so did Windeyer J. Owen J found that the petitioning creditor was within the meaning of the expression 'contingent creditor' and therefore entitled to petition for the winding up of Community Development Pty Limited, although his Honour addressed other possible meanings of the expressions 'contingent debt' and 'contingent liability' in reaching that conclusion.

73 In The National Bank of Australasia Limited v Mason [1975] HCA 56 ; (1975) 133 CLR 191 Barwick CJ adopted the same approach as had been adopted by Kitto J in Engwirda . At 200 he said:
 
 'There must be some present obligation to pay out of which the money may become due' 
 

for monies to be regarded as 'owing contingently'.</text>

<text>74 In FAI Workers Compensation (NSW) Limited v Philkor Builders Pty Limited ('Philkor') (1996) 20 ACSR 592, Young J, as his Honour then was, held that the prospect of a plaintiff securing an entitlement to costs in winding up proceedings under the Corporations Law did not enable such a plaintiff to contend that a contingent debt was payable by the company to the plaintiff in circumstances where, before a winding up order was made, the company was placed in administration and a deed of company arrangement was thereafter executed following a resolution of the majority of creditors of the company that it should do so. Such resolution had not been supported by the plaintiff. This decision is quite unexceptional and has no real bearing on the resolution of the issues in the present case. As his Honour said at 597:
 
 'As under s 466 there is a personal obligation to bear one's own costs of a winding up petition until the winding up order is made and then a statutory right to get costs which commences as at that day, it does not appear to me that a claim for costs before the order is made can be classed as a contingent debt.'

<tocase>Fisher v Madden as Receiver and Manager of Dataflow Computer Services Pty Limited [2002] NSWCA 28 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 179</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/28.html</AustLII>
<text>77 In Fisher v Madden as Receiver and Manager of Dataflow Computer Services Pty Limited ('Fisher') [2002] NSWCA 28 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 179 the New South Wales Court of Appeal was concerned to determine whether a payment ordered by the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to be made under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) would be entitled to priority under s 556(1)(h) of the Corporations Law . In the course of his reasons for judgment Meagher JA adverted to s 553 of the Corporations Law at 183-5 [7] and [13]. In addressing whether any payment ordered to be made by the Commission might qualify as a contingent debt or claim within the meaning of s 553(1) of the Act his Honour said at [13]:
 
 '... The word "contingent" is a slippery word. ... In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gosstray [1986] VR 876 at 878, Tadgell J said: 
 
 
 
 "An attempt to formulate a universally applicable definition of a contingent debt or of a contingent creditor is difficult ... . A contingent creditor, like an elephant, is rather easier to recognize than to define. The following statement by Pennycuick J in Re William Hockley Ltd ... is well known: 'The expression "contingent creditor" ... must, I think, denote a person towards whom under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability upon the happening of some future event or at some future date'. In Re Gasbourne Pty Ltd [1984] VR 801 at 837, Nicholson J said that he did not regard that description as exhaustive, and with respect I would not disagree. ... " 
 
 
 
 It follows ... that ... one cannot accurately categorise Miss Fisher's rights (if any) as a "contingent" debt or claim. She has the bare right to make a claim, nobody knowing whether it will succeed or not, or if so in what amount, or subject to what terms or conditions. ...'

78 In his reasons for judgment Sheller JA, with whom Beazley JA agreed, said at 193 [44]:
 
 '... at the relevant date Dataflow was under no existing obligation to pay a sum of money by way of a retrenchment payment to Ms Fisher immediately or on a future event. Ms Fisher had only a right to take proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission to vary the contract to that end. ... 
 
 [46] However Ms Fisher's right under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act be categorised, her right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission did not until such time as an order was made create any obligation on Dataflow to make a retrenchment payment to her. Moreover, even if the Industrial Relations Commission declared the contract unfair, varied it ab initio and ordered Dataflow to make a retrenchment payment to Ms Fisher, it remains true that at the relevant date of Mr Madden's appointment no amount for retrenchment payment had become payable before, on or after the relevant date.'

79 The position in relation to a claim under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) is on all fours with a claim for costs in respect of an application to wind up a company to which s 466 of the Act applies.

80 Following the process of reasoning indicated in Fisher , Gzell J held in Silbermann v One.Tel Limited (No 2) [2002] NSWSC 295 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 846 at 850-1 that an application to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission for the variation of a contract of service to include an indemnity against a director's liability in respect of corporate credit cards issued by American Express International Inc and Diners Club Pty Limited did not constitute future claims within the meaning of s 553 of the Act which were admissible to proof against the respondent, One.Tel Limited.

82 After referring to a passage from Sheller JA in Fisher , Gzell J continued at [16]:
 
 '... it seemed unlikely to his Honour that the legislative intention was no longer to confine an obligation to one in existence at the relevant date but to extend the category of future claim to any obligation which comes into existence at any time in the future. In my view, such a construction of s 553(1) would place an intolerable burden on a liquidator whose responsibility it is to determine which future claims are to be admitted to proof and in what amounts.'</text>

<tocase>Molit (No. 55) Pty Limited v Lam Soon Australia Pty Limited (Administrator Appointed) (1996) 19 ACSR 160</tocase>
<text>83 In Molit (No. 55) Pty Limited v Lam Soon Australia Pty Limited (Administrator Appointed) ('Molit') (1996) 19 ACSR 160 at 170, Branson J cited with approval a passage from Crutchfield's Annotated Corporate Voluntary Administration Law in which he said:
 
 '... it is submitted that the correct position is that such future claims [i.e. claims for future rent and future breaches of covenant] are admissible to proof in a winding-up. This appears to be clear from the terms of s 553 itself and s 554B, which provides for the discounting in accordance with the Regulations of debts payable on a future date. See also McPherson, The Law of Company Liquidation (3 rd ed, p376). If the position were otherwise, the clear intention of Pt 5.3A to enable a company, the subject to a deed of company arrangement, to make a "fresh start", free of the claims of creditors arising out of pre-administration dealings, would be frustrated. '

84 In Molit , Branson J held that a covenant by a lessee to pay rent by calendar monthly payments in advance on the first day of each month during the term of the lease, created future claims with respect to such payments, contingent upon the lease not being determined pursuant to the terms of the lease or otherwise by agreement. Her Honour found that in the deed of company arrangement there under consideration the lessor was a creditor of the company so far as its claims for future rent under the lease were concerned (see 169-70).</text>

<tocase>McCluskey v Pasminco Limited (Administrators appointed) [2002] FCA 231 ; (2002) 120 FCR 326</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/231.html</AustLII>
<text>22 Prior to the administrator rejecting the proof of debt for voting purposes to the extent to which it claimed an amount in excess of $1.4m the administrator received from his lawyers a letter of advice dated 19 April 2006, which relevantly provided as follows:
 
 'The issue discussed at our meeting with the directors and Phillips Fox was whether ... the claims of EES and Caltex (to the extent that they have any claims) with respect to costs are debts/claims which are provable in any Deed of Company Arrangement that may be proposed. As we have indicated to you in our view they are not. 
 
 It is of course a matter for any party propounding a Deed of Company Arrangement to specify in the proposal the debts and claims of creditors which are provable in the Deed (see section 444A(4) of the Corporations Act ). Relevantly however section 444A(4)(i) states that the Deed must specify the day (being a day not later than the day when the administration began) on or before which claims must have arisen if they are to be admissible under the Deed. The word " claims " is not defined in the Act although the definition contained in 553 of the Corporations Act which deals with debts provable in a winding up is often used as the definitions in a Deed as to which claims are provable in the Deed. 
 
 Whatever definition of claims is incorporated into the Deed however it is clearly the case that the claim must have " arisen " by the time of the Administrator's appointment for the debt to be provable. The question arises whether the asserted right of Caltex and EES to the benefit of Costs Orders is a claim which has " arisen " as at the date that the Administrator was appointment (sic) . In our view the claims had not " arisen " at that date. 
 
 As long ago as 1899 the Courts had determined (in Bankruptcy proceedings see Re: British Goldfields of West Africa (1899) 2 Ch 7) that the legal costs arising out of Court proceedings are not provable unless an Order is made for the payment prior to the date of the winding up. The New South Wales Supreme Court recently considered this position when determining whether the costs incurred by an applicant in seeking to wind up a company are provable in a subsequent Deed of Company Arrangement in circumstances where no Order had been made for costs with respect to that application prior to the Administrator's appointment. The Court held that such costs were not provable in the Deed of Company Arrangement ( see McDonald v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2005] NSWSC 2 ; (2005) 23 ACLC 324). 
 
 The logic behind these decisions is that the award of costs is a matter which is wholly within the discretion of the Court. While in many cases it is fairly predictable as to how that discretion will be exercised (ordinarily costs follow the event so that the successful party would expect an Order to be made in their favour with respect to costs) until the Court actually exercises its discretion to make an Order it is wholly impossible for an Administrator or Liquidator to make an assessment that the discretion will be exercised in a particular way. 
 
 It seems to us this is particularly the case in the circumstances of this matter. The issue concerning costs is complicated. There are clearly complex matter to be taken into account in determining what if any Costs Orders should be made and it seems to us those complexities only reinforce the importance of the following the previous authorities and not allowing EES or Caltex to vote with respect to any amount they may claim for legal costs nor to participate in any distribution that may be under any Deed of Company Arrangement that may be proposed. 
 
 There have been cases which have considered exceptions to this principle. There is some authority for the proposition that contractual arrangements between the parties may alter the legal position. If for instance a party agrees in a contract to be responsible for another parties legal costs then there is an argument that the costs have arisen under that contract and so may be provable. In Re: Pasminco Limited [2002] FCA 231 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 782 considered whether costs associated with pursuing a personal injury action against the Company would be provable. The Court considered alternative views as to the nexus between incurring costs and obtaining compensation for personal injury but reinforced the general principle that costs are not provable in the absence of agreement to the contrary or an Order for their payment. 
 
 In all the circumstances we confirm that we do not believe EES and/or Caltex should be allowed to vote or prove for their legal costs. To the extent that an Order is made by the Court subsequently those costs will be claimable against the Company and it may be if Caltex and EES intend to pursue their claim for costs (if an order is made in their favour) that it is important for the purposes of any Deed proposal that the directors commit to continuing to resist the making of any Order for Costs and give some consideration as to how any Order against the Company would subsequently be funded. It seems to us little point in proceeding with a Deed of Company Arrangement if the commercial reality is that the Company will subsequently face insolvency by breach of its inability to meet an adverse Costs Order.'

85 McCluskey v Pasminco Limited (Administrators appointed) ('Pasminco') [2002] FCA 231 ; (2002) 120 FCR 326 was concerned with the status of claims for legal costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting claims for injury compensation prior to the date of the commencement of the administration of Pasminco Limited and 21 other companies in the Pasminco Group. Prior to the appointment of the administrators there were approximately 442 claims outstanding against three of the Pasminco companies for injury compensation. The Pasminco Group carried on a number of lead and zinc mining and smelting operations. Goldberg J held that the claims for injury compensation were admissible to proof in the administration they being present claims sounding in damages under s 553(1) of the Act, the relevant workplace events giving rise to the claims having occurred prior to the commencement of the administration. His Honour found that the claims for injury compensation were present claims which had to be valued or quantified by the administrator and in respect of which a just estimate of value must be made before the relevant claimants were allowed to vote at a creditors meeting. His Honour proceeded to find that any claims for legal costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting the claims for injury compensation prior to the date of the commencement of the administration were admissible to proof as contingent claims because of their association and connection with the primary claims for injury compensation, even though there had not been any costs orders obtained for the payment of such legal costs and expenses prior to the commencement of the administration. (See 338 at [39]-[41]).

87 The criticism, by way of obiter, of the decision of Goldberg J in Pasminco , by Finkelstein J in McLellan v Australian Stock Exchange Limited ('McLellan') [2005] FCA 585 ; (2005) 144 FCR 327 at 331-3 [12] - [17] may require further consideration in the light of the matters recorded in these reasons with respect to the relevant statutory framework now prevailing as noted under the heading '"Creditors" for the purpose of Part 5.3A decision meetings '.

95 In my opinion it is questionable whether for the purposes of establishing admissibility to proof, at least for voting purposes, it is necessary to be able to identify a prior 'obligation' out of which a debt or liability, or, for that matter, a claim, arises. However, such considerations would, no doubt, bear upon the determination of just estimates of the value of claims that may be made. It is also questionable whether the traditional concepts of 'future' and 'contingent' as applied to 'debts payable by' a company, necessarily have the same connotations when applied to 'claims against' a company within the meaning of s 553(1) of the Act (cf. the observations of Finkelstein J in McLellan at 330 [9] and 333 [16]).

96 In the present case, Mr Aldridge SC, counsel for the plaintiff, submits that his client had, as at the date of the appointment of the administrator to Charben, a 'present' 'claim' for costs in respect of the trial and of the appeal to the Full Court, 'the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant date', namely the success of the plaintiff on its appeal with the consequential orders made in the plaintiff's favour on 22 December 2005 in respect of the disposition of the appeal and of the proceedings. Therefore, he submits, that such claim was admissible to proof against the company and the plaintiff was entitled to have its value determined in accordance with s 554A of the Act.

97 In the alternative, counsel for the plaintiff submits that the plaintiff had, as at the date of the appointment of the administrator to Charben, a 'contingent' 'claim' for such costs 'the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the relevant date' with the same consequences.</text>
