<text>58 As was observed in Sea Culture International Pty Ltd v Scoles and Others [1991] FCA 523 ; (1991) 32 FCR 275 at 279, there is an infinite variety of circumstances which may give rise to an abuse of process (see also Ashmore v British Coal Corporation [1990] 2 QB 338 at 348). However, the Court is mindful that the power to strike out proceedings should be used only in exceptional cases where the facts disclose a clear case of abuse: see Sea Culture at 279.</text>

<tocase>Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 831</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/831.html</AustLII>
<text>25 On 24 May 2007 Edmonds J, having observed that the applicant had not put before his Honour any material upon which 'I might conclude that the orders made below are attended with sufficient doubt to warrant them being reconsidered by this Court' refused the application for leave with costs: see Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 831.

26 On 5 April 2007 the Commonwealth applied for security for costs in the Federal Magistrates Court.

27 On 29 May 2007 Mr Croker filed an application for a stay in the Federal Magistrates Court 'until the outcome of an application to the High Court of Australia' . No such application existed.</text>

<text>31 On 17 October 2007 the application for leave to appeal against such orders was dismissed by Buchanan J. His Honour also ordered Mr Croker to pay the costs of the application for leave: see Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593.

32 On 31 October 2007 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones stayed the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings SYG 548 of 2007 pending payment for security for costs and ordered that proceedings be dismissed if security was not paid by 5.00 pm on 16 November 2007.

33 Mr Croker did not pay the amount so ordered. On 22 November 2007 the Commonwealth wrote to Mr Croker advising that, in the absence of payment of security as ordered, the proceedings were dismissed. On 6 March 2008 an order was made by Lloyd-Jones FM dismissing the proceedings. An order was also made for payment by Mr Croker of the costs of the Commonwealth.</text>

<tocase>Re Summers and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] AATA 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2005/125.html</AustLII>
<text>46 The written submissions include reference to the Legal Services Directions 2005 , Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and to the 'Model Litigant' responsibility referred to in Re Summers and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] AATA 125. Mr Croker submits that the standard of fair dealing which was referred to in such authorities applies to the Commonwealth as a model litigant.

47 The facts giving rise to Mr Croker's claim and the relief claimed in the current proceedings are, subject to the increase in damages claimed from $100,000 to $200,000, the same as those referred to in NSD 2478 of 2006 which were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court and became proceedings SYG 548 of 2007. Those proceedings were dismissed because Mr Croker did not comply with the order made by Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones on 31 October 2007.

48 The statements of claim in both proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 and in the current proceedings include claims under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of warranty and a claim for 'wrongfully defending a claim' . The last mentioned claim is predicated upon the basis that the Commonwealth is required to observe a policy of fair dealing pursuant to the direction of the Attorney-General under s 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</text>
