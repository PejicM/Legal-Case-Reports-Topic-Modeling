<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>3 It is possible under the rules of court for an extension of that 21 day period to be granted. The rules of court require that a special reason form the basis of any such extension. The leading authority in relation to whether or not to grant an extension is a decision of the Full Court in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187.

4 In essence, special reason is intended to distinguish a particular case from the usual course, according to which the time limit is 21 days. Under the rules of court, I have a discretion to exercise, if satisfied that there is a special reason which justifies departure from the general rule in a particular case. I also remind myself that the rules of court are meant to be a servant of justice, rather than a master of justice. An application for extension of time was not lodged in court until 30 November 2007.

5 The Applicant has, by his affidavit, sworn that he did not receive the judgment until 23 October 2007 when he personally got it from the Federal Court Registry in Queens Square. I take it that what is meant by this, is that he did not get a written copy of the Magistrate's decision and reasons until then. That particular statement is not challenged by the Minister. I accept that it was not until 23 October 2007 that the Applicant received the written version of the Court's decision and reasons. Even allowing for that, more than 21 days expired prior to the application for an extension of time.</text>
