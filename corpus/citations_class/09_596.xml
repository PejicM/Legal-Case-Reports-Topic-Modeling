<tocase>MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483</tocase>

<text>It was the existence of the report and the information in it about the alternative motive for coming to Australia that was of "dispositive relevance" to the Convention claims advanced by the appellant before the Tribunal: MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27] . Particulars of the information and the reason why it may be relevant were given to the appellant in accordance with s 424A(1)(b).

The fact that the information may have been provided in the first instance by the appellant to the tour operator was of no dispositive relevance and was not required to be supplied to the appellant.

To the extent that it is permissible to refer to the Tribunal's reasons to determine whether the Tribunal considered the source of the information to be a reason for affirming the decision, the reasons of the Tribunal, in particular at [87], support the conclusion I have reached.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The proper construction of s 424A(1) was referred to by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ff and by a Full Court in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] . It has also been dealt with in subsequent authorities. I referred to them in my decision in SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 107 ALD 121 at [13] [19].

I accept of course that, as the High Court said in SZBYR at [17], the question is to be determined in advance of, and independently from, the Tribunal's reasoning. But whether one looks at the transcript of the hearing, or the Tribunal's reasons, it is plain, in my opinion, that the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate was correct.

As his Honour said at [20], the information which the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the decision was that a report had been received which indicated that there was a motive for the appellant wishing to come to Australia different from that which formed the basis of his application for a protection visa, and the existence of that report cast doubt upon the credibility of the appellant.

This is clear from what the Tribunal put to the appellant during the oral hearing as revealed in the passage from the transcript set out above.

Moreover, as the Federal Magistrate went on to say at [20], the existence of the report and the reason why it may be relevant to the decision making process was clearly explained in the s 424A letter.

In my opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the proper construction of 
 s 424A(1)(a) and the authorities which have construed it. In my view, the effect of what the High Court said in SZBYR at [17], and, in particular, of what the Full Court said in SZKLG at [33] is that the word "considers" in s 424(1)(a) is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case.</text>

There is some tension in the authorities as to what use, if any, can be made of the Tribunal's written reasons in determining whether s 424A(1)(a) was enlivened. In SZMPT at [16] [18], I expressed the view that the Tribunal's reasons are not the starting point, but that it may be appropriate to refer to them to determine whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review.</text>
