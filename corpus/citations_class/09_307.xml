<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/78.html</AustLII>
<text>Magistrate Payne noted Mrs Bogdan's evidence that her father-in-law produced the draft plan and ultimately the plan was taken to Igor Designs for a final plan to be prepared. Magistrate Payne noted that Mr Bogdan did not give evidence and this was unhelpful as he was, according to Mrs Bogdan's evidence, one of the persons who drew up the plan. Magistrate Payne found it unhelpful that no evidence was called from anyone from Igor Designs. Her Honour referred to ss 10 , 14 , 31 and 36 of the Copyright Act and placed reliance upon paras [38], [41], [42], [44], [49] and [55] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 (Moore J agreeing). Magistrate Payne noted those paragraphs as they contain a statement of principles that, in her Honour's view, governed the resolution of the case.

At those paragraphs, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ note these principles.

Magistrate Payne also referred to [111] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood in which their Honours said this: 
 If there is to be a finding of reproduction of a substantial part of a work, the substantial part should be identified . His Honour referred to "the overall design and combination of features" but gives no further detail . His Honour did not attempt to identify any part of the Baltimore as being a qualitatively substantial part of the Baltimore in the sense discussed at [47] [56] above. With respect we think his Honour erred in this regard. Likewise, "striking similarity", without more , does not necessarily mean that there has been a reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the plan of a project home. The similarity referred to may have been that of common ideas .
 [emphasis added]

Her Honour then applied those principles to the evidence before noting that a plan for a project home is partly functional reflecting "reasonable proximities" that would not be a "substantial part" of a house plan regarded as an artistic work. Her Honour made this finding at p 10 of her reasons: 
 If seen in isolation, a comparison of the Bogdan plan and the Jennings Cortona and Verona plans shows there are striking similarities.

Taking up the notion of a requirement on the part of Jennings, in order to discharge its onus, to show more than striking similarities, so as to establish reproduction of the work either as to the whole work or as to a substantial part, Magistrate Payne said this: 
 The footprint of the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Cortona plan are similar, although there are differences. There is also similarity between the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Verona plan, and again there are differences, and I say this noting that the Bogdan plan was a mirror reverse of the AV Jennings plans. There is a similarity between the arrangement of the rooms and the footprint of the buildings, although all three are different from each other in some respects. These differences include a different floor plan and different roof line. However, it is not the footprint or floor plan alone the plaintiff complains of. The plaintiff says it is the footprint with the original or distinguishing feature of displayed walls and the higher ceilings. 

 
 [emphasis added]

Magistrate Payne then expressed the view set out in para 2 quoted below, which resonates with the reservation expressed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in the last sentence of [111] in Tamawood : 
 I note also that Mr and Mrs Bogdan did little to assist me other than to say that Mrs Bogdan in her evidence had never heard of AV Jennings and had never seen one of their plans and she said she had not seen one of their homes until she was contacted by AV Jennings. ... However, despite this little assistance the onus rests on the plaintiff in this matter. When considering all of those similarities and dissimilarities which I have done and then, in applying the law, I do not consider that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proof. 

 
 I find that the displayed walls and raised ceiling to be that of a common idea and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the AV Jennings Verona plan or Cortona plan by either or both of the first or second defendant. 
 [emphasis added] 

 Consideration of the issues on appeal

As to subconscious copying, Willmer LJ noted in Francis Day &amp; Hunter at p 613 that, "if subconscious copying is to be found, there must be proof (or at least a strong inference) of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied". In the absence of any direct evidence of use of or access to the Jennings plan in suit, the causal link can be established by inference. The greater the degree of objective similarity between the two plans, the more likely it is that an inference of actual use might be drawn ( S W Hart &amp; Co (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 472; Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 per Heerey, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ). Exact copying is rarely the conduct in controversy. Normally an inference is sought to be drawn in the face of quantitative features of the plan in suit, present in the plan under challenge, or by correspondence with a substantial part qualitatively of the plaintiff's plan, or both. If the contention is that a substantial part of the plan in suit has been taken, a question of "fact and degree" arises ( Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 per Weinberg J at [71]) and the "protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright" ( Inform Design , per Weinberg J at [71] [emphasis added]). An allegation of substantial reproduction of the work by reproduction of a substantial part will be made out if what is taken is an essential or material part of the work in suit. The phrase "substantial part" refers to the quality of that taken and the importance it bears to the work as a whole ( Tamawood v Henley Arch at [50], [52] and [54]; Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ; Autodesk Inc. v Dyason [No. 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 per Mason CJ at 305). It may be that a particular orientation and layout of rooms which draws a user through a structure in a particular way is an essential or material part of a plan ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 161 ALR 503 at [74] ). Essentiality is a question of fact and degree.

In Tamawood at [111], Wilcox and Lindgren JJ (Moore J agreeing) noted that striking similarities however may not be enough in circumstances where the plaintiff has failed to identify the "substantial part" reproduced and has put its case on the footing of the "overall design and combination of features but gives no further detail ". In such circumstances, their Honours noted that substantial similarities may simply be referable to "common ideas". Magistrate Payne found that splayed walls and raised ceilings are a "common idea" and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of either the Verona plan or the Cortona plan by either respondent. The evidence before Magistrate Payne did not establish the notion that angled walls are a common idea. It is true that the Jennings plans, the Bogdan plan and the Dixon plan exhibit elevated ceilings. However, the conclusion reached by Magistrate Payne did not take into account the particular combination of features reflected at [61] to [65] of these reasons, the evidence of Mr Deshon concerning the evolution of the Bogdan plan as a contended progression from the Canberra plan and the evidence in relation to the features of Annexure C (that is, the elements of [61] to [69]). The evidence that supports the conclusion of striking similarities based upon the identified combination of precise features makes it clear that the combination cannot be described as commonplace or simply a common idea. Taken separately, the notion of elevated ceilings may not suggest actual use of a Jennings plan. The adoption, by itself, of angled walls at 15 degrees "off the right angled rib" might not be sufficient to suggest actual use although the evidence suggests that such a feature is an essential or material feature. The combination of those two features adds incremental weight to the notion of objective similarity suggesting use. The combination of those features together with a floor plan exhibiting substantial similarity in orientation and layout of rooms further supports an inference of use. The expert evidence casting doubt on the proffered explanation of the origin of the Bogdan plan adds further weight to the inference as does Mr Deshon's evidence that the magazine photograph (Exhibit 6) would not lead him to a design of elevated flat ceilings had the photograph been produced to him as a starting point for a design of the rooms and ceilings in a new house, reflecting the design depicted in the photograph.

Accordingly, her Honour in reaching the finding as to a "common idea" did not take into account all of the evidence. Moreover, the notion that something more must be shown is put in proper context by their Honours in Tamawood . As their Honours noted, that case concerned circumstances where the plaintiff had failed to identify the substantial part said to be reproduced and had put its case on the basis of overall design and a combination of features in circumstances where no detail had been given.

That is not this case.

It follows therefore that the evidence supports an inference that the Bogdan plan evolved through the use of either of the Jennings Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 or the Cortona 290 (as the embodiment of the combination of features identified and relied upon by the appellant). The question that remains is whether the evidence supports an inference of actual use by either or both of the respondents. Mrs Bogdan gave the evidence described earlier in these reasons which led to a finding of fact and a finding of credit ([50] of these reasons) in her favour. Magistrate Payne accepted her evidence entirely and especially her evidence that she had not seen a Jennings plan and did not have any knowledge that the Bogdan plan was a copy of any Jennings plan. That finding was plainly open on the evidence and counsel for Jennings accepted that such a finding was open to her Honour.

It follows therefore that Mrs Bogdan did not make actual use of any Jennings plan in either formulating her ideas or contributing those ideas to her husband and/or Mr Florien Bogdan and there is no basis for disturbing those findings.

However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was an author of Annexure C to Exhibit 4 and contributed together with Mr Florien Bogdan to the draft drawings. Mr Florien Bogdan produced Annexure D1 which was given to Igor Designs to produce Annexure E. Mr Bogdan, by his submissions, says that it is apparent from the transcript that he made statements throughout the proceeding that illustrate the nature of the evidence he would have given had Magistrate Payne made it plain to him that an adverse inference might arise should he not give evidence and those statements are set out at pp 26, 33, 35, 36, 62, 74 to 76 and 84 and 85 of the transcript. However, even if an assumption is made that the statements at those pages of the transcript ought to be treated as, in effect, oral evidence, the statements do not answer the conclusion open on the totality of the evidence that authors of the Bogdan plan used either the Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 plan or the Cortona 290 plan (as the embodiment in final form of the features in those plans and the plan in suit) in bringing into existence the Bogdan plan with its combination of features evident in the Cortona 290 plan.

It may be that an inference is open that either Mr Bogdan used a Jennings plan and reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant or alternatively, Mr Florien Bogdan did so. Alternatively, an inference might be found that both men so used the plan. It seems likely as a matter of inference from all the evidence and particularly that of Mrs Bogdan, that Mr Florien Bogdan as a carpenter who had previously built eight houses, used a Jennings plan and thus reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant. However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was responsible for Annexure C and was a contributory author to the drawings (see [44] to [48] of these reasons). Mrs Bogdan referred to eight drawings in all in the evolution of the Bogdan plan, although only those drawings annexed to Exhibit 4 were produced in evidence.

It follows, that Magistrate Payne erred by failing to find use of the appellant's work and reproduction in a material form of that work in suit, as against the respondent, Mr Tiberiu Bogdan. It follows that the order of the Court below dismissing the appellant's claim against Mr Tiberiu Bogdan is to be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff below. The second question that arises is the assessment of damages. The Court below did not assess nor make findings as to the quantum of the plaintiff's damage. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to do so. Damages</text>

<text>The application of the law of copyright to project homes gives rise to special difficulty as the drawing of plans for project homes involves a mixture of the use of familiar ideas based on objects in the real world and many other project homes and plans for them, on the one hand; and the labour, skill and judgment of an author in combining and expressing those ideas in an original work on the other. The more simple and straightforward the work, the closer the similarity must be for infringement to be found. The notion of reproduction involves resemblance to the owner's work and actual use of that work ( S W Hart &amp; Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 472 per Gibbs CJ), or put another way, what is required is "a sufficient degree of objective similarity between the two works and ... some causal connection between [the two works]" ( Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron (1963) 1 Ch. 587 at p 614 per Willmer LJ). Causal connection and objective similarity are components of reproduction of the work in a material form. Causal connection might be inferred from access to the plan in suit and objective similarity between that work and the plan said to infringe. Too much can be made of the distinction between the work and a substantial part of it. The notion of substantial part may be found most useful where particular quantitatively small parts of the work in suit, are taken. Can it be said that a quantitatively small part is, for identified reasons given in evidence, nevertheless a substantial part of the work? The ultimate question is not infringement of the part but infringement of the whole . Whether there has been infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part taken be considered in relation to the work as a whole. The question is whether the part is an "essential or material" feature of the whole.

As to subconscious copying, Willmer LJ noted in Francis Day &amp; Hunter at p 613 that, "if subconscious copying is to be found, there must be proof (or at least a strong inference) of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied".

Causal connection and objective similarity are components of reproduction of the work in a material form. Causal connection might be inferred from access to the plan in suit and objective similarity between that work and the plan said to infringe. Too much can be made of the distinction between the work and a substantial part of it. The notion of substantial part may be found most useful where particular quantitatively small parts of the work in suit, are taken. Can it be said that a quantitatively small part is, for identified reasons given in evidence, nevertheless a substantial part of the work? The ultimate question is not infringement of the part but infringement of the whole . Whether there has been infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part taken be considered in relation to the work as a whole. The question is whether the part is an "essential or material" feature of the whole.

There is no doubt that Jennings bears the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the respondents made actual use of the work in suit and having used the work, they brought into existence a plan that either takes a substantial part of the plan in suit, shown to be an essential or material feature of the whole (although perhaps a quantitatively small part) or takes substantially the whole plan, viewed quantitatively, assuming that an exact copy of the plan in suit has not been made. As to the last matter, no such claim is made. In this case, actual use is sought to be established as an inference arising out of contended striking similarities between the two plans. Those striking similarities then speak to reproduction of the plan in suit and thus infringement. In Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron , Willmer LJ at p 614 noted, apart from the observations mentioned at [54] of these reasons, these further matters: 
 (3) Where there is a substantial degree of objective similarity, this of itself will afford prima facie evidence to show that there is a causal connection between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' work; at least it is a circumstance from which the inference may be drawn. 

 
 (4) The fact that the defendant denies that he consciously copied affords some evidence to rebut the inference of causal connection arising from the objective similarity, but is in no way conclusive.

<text>As to subconscious copying, Willmer LJ noted in Francis Day &amp; Hunter at p 613 that, "if subconscious copying is to be found, there must be proof (or at least a strong inference) of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied". In the absence of any direct evidence of use of or access to the Jennings plan in suit, the causal link can be established by inference. The greater the degree of objective similarity between the two plans, the more likely it is that an inference of actual use might be drawn ( S W Hart &amp; Co (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 472; Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 per Heerey, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ). Exact copying is rarely the conduct in controversy.

<tocase>New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1998/345.html</AustLII>
<text>Mrs Bogdan says that if the respondents had agreed to pay a licence fee to Jennings of $20,000.00, it would follow that Jennings would have no claim for the construction profit as the respondents would not have engaged Jennings to do the work. Mrs Bogdan says that conversely, if an assumption is made that Jennings would have been engaged to construct the respondents' house, there would be no licence fee. More fundamentally, Mrs Bogdan says that Jennings has not suffered any loss of profit based on construction because "we weren't intending to hire A V Jennings to build our house". Mrs Bogdan said that she had obtained advice from lawyers who advised her that on the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345 , per Burchett J, the appropriate fee for use of a project home drawing was found to be $750.00 and that the case is authority for the proposition that no claim for loss of profit can be sustained in the face of evidence that the infringing respondent would not have engaged the plaintiff to construct the home. Mrs Bogdan says: 
 This is exactly the case here. 

 
 There is no evidence or even suggestion that the respondents would have engaged Jennings to construct the house in question and indeed such a claim is not even alleged in the statement of claim.

More generally, Mrs Bogdan in making the point that the respondents are not project home builders or in the business of building houses, said this: 
 ... to close, we say that we're not business. We're not intending to make business out of our home. We built it for us. We're not builders. We've got an owner/builder permit to do our own home.

Mrs Bogdan referred to the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore (supra) and observations made by Burchett J. In that case, Burchett J considered a claim for compensatory damages in circumstances where, like this case, the respondent "did not construct a house for sale, but as a home to live in" (p 7). His Honour at p 8 referred to a number of authorities that support the proposition that the Court may adopt as a measure of damages where it thinks the course appropriate, a fair fee for the use of the plan the subject of the infringement. Burchett J noted that the applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of the profit it would have earned by the sale of a kit for the construction of the respondents' house. However, the evidence demonstrated that the respondent would never have purchased a kit home from the applicant "under any circumstances" and thus the infringement did not cause the loss of profit on the sale of a kit home. The applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of a licence fee of $6,000.00 for the use of the kit home construction plans. His Honour referred to evidence that suggested a licence fee based on a fee paid to a draftsman of $535.00 was a more likely fair licence fee and thus awarded the applicant damages of $750.00, as mentioned in submissions by Mrs Bogdan.

In this case, it is equally clear that had Jennings quoted to the respondents an amount of $198,550.00 (including GST) as the price for the construction of the Bogdan home including the variations to the plan the subject of the amount of $16,424.00 mentioned in the evidence of Mr Henesey-Smith, the Bogdans would not have accepted that quote. Jennings would not have undertaken the project and would not have derived the construction profit or any profit.

Accordingly, in assessing the damages on that footing, I take into account these matters. In this case, the respondents, like the respondent in New England Country Homes , chose to devise a plan for and then construct a home to live in rather than a house for sale. In doing so, Mr Bogdan engaged in conduct of reproducing the appellant's plan in a material form. There is no suggestion that either respondent will engage in any further infringing conduct. Nor is there any evidence that Jennings has suffered a diminution in its revenue by reason of this transactional act of infringement. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that Jennings would not have derived any profit from the project as the respondents would not have either paid a licence fee to or contracted with Jennings for the design and construction of their home.

Nevertheless, the fact that the respondents would not have contracted with Jennings is not an answer to the Jennings' claim for damages suffered as a result of the infringement. It is necessary to formulate the damages referable to the act of infringement by attempting to disaggregate the bundle of services Jennings supplies to a client so as to isolate the best estimate of damages possible on the evidence available as a measure of the appellant's loss directly related to infringement. In undertaking that exercise, it is not appropriate to bring into account the cost of the additions to the Bogdan plan not reflected in the Cortona 290 . Jennings says that the direct cost of design and construction of a Cortona 290 in January 2004 was $118,912.00. A margin of 25% based on those foundation costs would amount to $29,728.00. Jennings, of course, says that its 25% margin is struck on the gross turnover value excluding GST which in respect of the Cortona 290 excluding the Bogdan additions seems to be $164,076.00 representing a margin of $41,019.00 on the preferred method adopted by Jennings. That method of calculating a margin on the turnover value excluding GST is a calculation of its design and construction profit. Damages ought not to be calculated on that footing. An examination of these approaches to the calculation of profit is simply an indication of the net loss Jennings might have derived had it undertaken the project (leaving aside the variations for this purpose). One way of forming a view of the contribution of the copyright in the plan to that profit is to appreciate the aggregation of services which give rise to the profit and to then disaggregate those services and apportion some part of the profit to the use of the plan as an analogue of loss suffered by Jennings by reason of the use by Mr Bogdan of the Jennings plan as joint author with Mr Florien Bogdan. The profit calculation is simply a base starting point. Doing the best I can on the available evidence which is very limited, I estimate the contribution of the copyright in the plan at about 10%. The vast majority of the profit is, no doubt, referable to the quantities of materials supplied and the construction, supervision and completion of the home itself.

On that footing, the damages would range between $2,972.00 and $4,101.00. It seems to me that the appropriate amount is the average of the two namely, $3,536.00. There is no basis for an award of exemplary damages.</text>

<text>Although an award of damages pursuant to s 115(2) of the Copyright Act might in an appropriate case be the measure of the depreciation in the value of the exclusive bundle of rights comprising the copyright, as a chose in action ( Sutherland Publishing Co. Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd [1936] 1 Ch. 323 per Lord Wright MR; Microsoft Corporation v Atifo Pty Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 643) , it is not the right measure in a case such as this ( Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 475 per Wilcox J; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society of New South Wales (1975) 6 ALR 445 , Bowen CJ at Eq 446). There is, understandably, no evidence of a discounted cash flow valuation of the copyright as a capital asset nor, equally understandably, any evidence of any diminution, by reason of the infringement, in the capacity of Jennings to derive revenue by exploiting the copyright work, that is, by using the plan and constructing houses representing a three-dimensional reproduction of the plan, for clients. In this case, the respondents built a single house as their residential dwelling. They are not project home builders and they are not in the business of repetitious infringing conduct. Since there is no demonstrated impact on the exploitation revenues Jennings derives from the use of the Cortona 290 plan, there is very likely to be no corresponding impact on the value of the copyright as an incorporeal right.

However, the formulation of Lord Wright in Sutherland has been described as "no more than a convenient label for the various ways of assessing damages which are available in any particular case" ( Australasian Performing Rights Association v Grebo Trading Co. Pty Ltd (1978) 23 ACTR 30 per Blackburn CJ at 31) and the question to be answered is, what loss has Jennings suffered as a result of the infringement of its copyright? ( Interfirm at 446) As to the general principles concerning the assessment of damages for breach of copyright, see Autodesk v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 474 477; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 111 ALR 269 at 285; Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137 and Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554. Jennings contends that it does not licence its copyright to enable third party construction to occur. It keeps its copyright in a Jennings safe harbour and uses it solely in its own construction activity. Therefore, it is said, Jennings ought not to be treated in an analogous position to an architect who might, by reason of the nature of the professional work an architect undertakes, be subject to an implied licence of the copyright in a work produced in connection with particular projects. Nor, it is said, should the hypothetical "construct" of a notional willing licensor and licensee be adopted as the framework for determining a surrogate measure of damages by reference to a licence fee. The pleading claims damages on the alternative bases of either a fee for use of the plan or lost profits in the construction of the Bogdan home. Presumably, the pleading does so in order to preserve alternative possible formulations of a remedy in damages in respect of proven infringing conduct. However, it is clear that the letter of demand from Jennings dated 19 November 2003 made a claim for a fee for use of the plan for an amount which remains the amount claimed as a fee for use in the amended pleading.</text>

In Autodesk v Cheung , Wilcox J did not apply the licence fee approach to the assessment of damages because his Honour could not draw the inference, on the facts of that case, that the respondent, presented with a choice between paying a licence fee or not using the work, would have paid the licence fee. It was simply not a likely event. Similarly, Tamberlin J took the view on the facts before his Honour in Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. &amp; Anor v Luckins (1996) 34 IPR 504 at 509 that a licence was unrealistic. His Honour observed at 509: 
 In my view, the licence fee approach is not appropriate in a situation where it is clear that there never would have been a licence granted by the applicants because of the disruption such a licence would inflict on the applicants' basic strategic marketing timetable in Australia.

The evidence in this case does not suggest any element of a competitive threat by the respondent, Mr Bogdan, to the activities of Jennings nor is there any suggestion of any disruption to the applicant's activities manifest in the class of case reflected in the decisions in Autodesk v Cheung , Columbia Pictures v Luckins and Eagle Rock v Caisley . Equally clearly, the element of disruption was the factual foundation upon which their Honours came to the conclusion that the applicants in each case would not have granted a licence. It is clear in this case that had a licence been sought by the respondents from Jennings it would either not have been granted or alternatively a licence fee of $20,000.00 might have been nominated by Jennings. That possibility is at least consistent with the letter of demand and the pleading. Nevertheless, had Jennings sought a licence fee from the respondents of $20,000.00, plainly enough, the respondents would not have taken up that licence.</text>

Similarly, Tamberlin J took the view on the facts before his Honour in Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. &amp; Anor v Luckins (1996) 34 IPR 504 at 509 that a licence was unrealistic. His Honour observed at 509: 
 In my view, the licence fee approach is not appropriate in a situation where it is clear that there never would have been a licence granted by the applicants because of the disruption such a licence would inflict on the applicants' basic strategic marketing timetable in Australia.

In that case, Tamberlin J was addressing the assessment of damages arising out of the importation into Australia by the respondent of copies of films distributed on laser disks in the United States by Columbia Pictures . In that context, Tamberlin J rejected the utility of the licence fee approach. A similar view was taken in Eagle Rock v Caisley which concerned the assessment of damages arising out of the sale of DVD copies of an unauthorised recording of a live performance by Eric Clapton and his band. In Eagle Rock at [12], Tamberlin J said this: ... I do not consider that Eagle would, if requested, have granted a licence to Caisley or that Caisley would have paid the licence fee if he was given the choice between so doing or not using the copyright work. The two parties were in direct competition.

The evidence in this case does not suggest any element of a competitive threat by the respondent, Mr Bogdan, to the activities of Jennings nor is there any suggestion of any disruption to the applicant's activities manifest in the class of case reflected in the decisions in Autodesk v Cheung , Columbia Pictures v Luckins and Eagle Rock v Caisley . Equally clearly, the element of disruption was the factual foundation upon which their Honours came to the conclusion that the applicants in each case would not have granted a licence. It is clear in this case that had a licence been sought by the respondents from Jennings it would either not have been granted or alternatively a licence fee of $20,000.00 might have been nominated by Jennings. That possibility is at least consistent with the letter of demand and the pleading. Nevertheless, had Jennings sought a licence fee from the respondents of $20,000.00, plainly enough, the respondents would not have taken up that licence.</text>

<text>However, the formulation of Lord Wright in Sutherland has been described as "no more than a convenient label for the various ways of assessing damages which are available in any particular case" ( Australasian Performing Rights Association v Grebo Trading Co. Pty Ltd (1978) 23 ACTR 30 per Blackburn CJ at 31) and the question to be answered is, what loss has Jennings suffered as a result of the infringement of its copyright? ( Interfirm at 446) As to the general principles concerning the assessment of damages for breach of copyright, see Autodesk v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 474 477; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 111 ALR 269 at 285; Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137 and Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554. Jennings contends that it does not licence its copyright to enable third party construction to occur. It keeps its copyright in a Jennings safe harbour and uses it solely in its own construction activity. Therefore, it is said, Jennings ought not to be treated in an analogous position to an architect who might, by reason of the nature of the professional work an architect undertakes, be subject to an implied licence of the copyright in a work produced in connection with particular projects. Nor, it is said, should the hypothetical "construct" of a notional willing licensor and licensee be adopted as the framework for determining a surrogate measure of damages by reference to a licence fee. The pleading claims damages on the alternative bases of either a fee for use of the plan or lost profits in the construction of the Bogdan home. Presumably, the pleading does so in order to preserve alternative possible formulations of a remedy in damages in respect of proven infringing conduct. However, it is clear that the letter of demand from Jennings dated 19 November 2003 made a claim for a fee for use of the plan for an amount which remains the amount claimed as a fee for use in the amended pleading.

In that case, Tamberlin J was addressing the assessment of damages arising out of the importation into Australia by the respondent of copies of films distributed on laser disks in the United States by Columbia Pictures . In that context, Tamberlin J rejected the utility of the licence fee approach.
