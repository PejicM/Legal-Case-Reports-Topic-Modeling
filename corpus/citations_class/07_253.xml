<text>4 Secondly, he purports to sue as "managing trustee" of 26 trusts. It is unnecessary for me to consider whether or not Mr Garrett can properly appear for these trusts in the representative capacity he asserts. I would simply note, though, on the material before me and by Mr Garrett's own admission, the first two of the trusts listed are ones in respect of which he is a joint trustee along with a company, Evajade Pty Ltd. It would appear from a printout from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's national database that that company has no current directors and that it has a sole shareholder who has entered into a personal insolvency agreement under Pt X of the Bankruptcy Act . I would note in passing that that printout is proof of its contents in this regard in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The difficulties this may pose need not be explored here: cf In the Estate of William Just, deceased (No 1) (1973) 7 SASR 508; Ford and Lee, Principles of the Law of Trusts [9380].</text>

<text>5 Thirdly, he asserts to be sole director and shareholder (albeit in the capacity as a trustee) of 15 companies. As to the claim that he was sole director, he admitted under questioning that he was not now a director, his attention having been drawn to the provisions of s 206B(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and to the problems that section might cause him. They were also pointed out to him in turn by Gray J in Evajade Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank (No 2) (2005) SASC 229. Curiously two of the companies of which he asserts to be director and shareholder are Evajade Pty Ltd and the third respondent in this proceeding, The Wine Company Pty Ltd (the previous name of which was Andrew Garrett Group Pty Ltd). I have referred above to Evajade. As to The Wine Company, the ASIC national database printout reveals that company to have been de-registered on 15 January 2006 by ASIC pursuant to s 601AB of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). I need to emphasise this for reasons which will become apparent below.

6 Fourthly, he purports to proceed as assignee of causes of action including from the de-registered Wine Company. What is not clear is in what capacity he is acting as assignee or what those choses are.

7 Fifthly, he purports to be exercising powers of attorney on behalf of some number of persons and companies including his wife who is also an undischarged bankrupt. There is no evidence as to the type of cause of action vested in her which he is prosecuting on her behalf, let alone whether it is competent for her to assert it.</text>
