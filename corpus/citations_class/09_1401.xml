<tocase>Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC (2008) 26 ACLC 506</tocase>
<text>No question arises under s 468(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC [2008] FCA 474; (2008) 26 ACLC 506.

Put in simple terms, the following distributions occurred in the 2001 income year. CEPL as trustee of the CU Trust distributed the entire income of the trust to or for the benefit of a discretionary unit holder, DCE Holdings Pty Ltd ("Clark Holdings") as trustee of the David Clark Family Trust (the "Clark Family Trust"). Clark Holdings distributed the income so received to David Clark Enterprises Pty Ltd ("Clark Enterprises") as trustee of the David Clark Enterprises Trust (the "Enterprises Trust") and Clark Enterprises distributed the income of the trust to David Clark and Helen Clark in equal shares as beneficiaries of that trust. By s 97 of the 1936 Act, the assessable income of David Clark and Helen Clark includes a 50% share of the net income of the Enterprises Trust and in the event that the taxpayers are not able to establish that the CU Trust estate suffered previously unapplied net capital losses extinguishing the net capital gain arising out of the disposal of the Gladstone properties in the 2001 income year, the net income of the Enterprises Trust will also include a significant part of the net capital gain (discounted by 50%) made by the CU Trust in the 2001 income year.

Accordingly, the first question to be determined in these proceedings is whether the applicants have discharged the onus of establishing that in the 1988 income year, the trustee of the CU Trust acquired the Rothwells shares.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (1999) 43 ATR 42</tocase>
<text>In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (1999) 43 ATR 42; (1999) 167 ALR 147, Lee, Emmett and Gyles JJ at [51] observed that: 
 
 [A] trust estate ... will be that property the ownership of which is divided between trustee and beneficiary. The trustee will always be ascertainable. However, the class of beneficiaries, while identifiable, will not necessarily be closed and all beneficiaries may, of course, not be ascertainable.

The Full Court recognised at [49] that since lack of continuity in the identity of the trustee from income year to income year would not prevent losses (in this case capital losses) in earlier years being available as deductions from assessable income in a later year, "criteria must be established for determining when there is sufficient identity of the trusts involved to warrant such deductions being allowable".

In framing the criteria, the Full Court said this: 
 
 [52] The trust obligations of the trustee and the corresponding rights of the beneficiaries may vary from time to time, in accordance with law. Similarly, the property that is the subject of such obligations and rights will not be static. Parts of the property might be distributed so as to cease to be subject to trust obligations. Further property may accrue as income or by further settlement so as to become subject to obligations where previously that additional property was not. 
 

 
 
 [53] However, at any given time it will be possible to identify the property that is the subject of the trust obligations and in respect of which the rights of beneficiaries exist. It is the income which accrues from that property, less outgoings from that property, that go to make up the taxable income of the trust estate or fund. ... 
 

 
 
 [54] The [ITAA 1936] then imposes a liability either on the beneficiaries or, in some cases, on the trustee in a representative capacity. "Superannuation fund", as that term is defined in the SIS Act and the [ITAA 1936], contemplates a continuing regime regulating the manner in which a fund may be added to and the manner in which payments may be made from it. So long as one can identify a continuity of that regime, that will be sufficient. 
 

 
 
 [55] Thus, in order to determine whether losses of particular trust property are allowable as a deduction from income accruing to that trust property in a subsequent income year, it will be necessary to establish some degree of continuity of the trust property or corpus that earns the income from the income year of loss to the year of income. It will also be necessary to establish continuity of the regime of trust obligations affecting the property in the sense that, while amendment of those obligations might occur, any amendment must be in accordance with the terms of the original trust. 
 

 
 
 [56] So long as any amendment of the trust obligations relating to such trust property is made in accordance with any power conferred by the instrument creating the obligations, and continuity of the property that is the subject of trust obligation is established, there will be identity of the "taxpayer" for the purposes of s 278 and ss 79E(3) and 80(2), notwithstanding any amendment of the trust obligation and any change in the property itself.

The Full Court at [55] observed that in order to determine whether earlier losses of trust property are allowable as deductions from income (or capital gains) accruing to trust property in a subsequent income year, it will be necessary to establish some degree of continuity of the trust property or corpus that earns the income or capital gain from the income year of loss to the year of income. Secondly, there must be continuity of the regime of trust obligations affecting the trust property and while those obligations might change, continuity remains if the amendments are made in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument, in the proper exercise of the powers so conferred.

It follows that if some degree of continuity of trust property is made out and continuity in the regime of trust obligations is established, there will be sufficient identity of taxpayer in the sense that the hypothetical representative trustee taxpayer on behalf of the trust estate that incurred the loss is the hypothetical taxpayer of the trust estate that made the net capital gain.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (2001) 75 ALJR 1172</tocase>
<text>Although the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (2001) 75 ALJR 1172 considered the re-settlement analysis undertaken by the Full Court, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ, observed at [36] that, as the Full Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had held, the question of the availability of the deduction was one of continuity to be considered, in that case, in the context of a superannuation fund which, of its nature, may be expected to undergo change. The Court at [36] said this: 
 
 The question is whether the eligible entity which derived the taxable income in the year ended 30 June 1995 is a different entity from the eligible entity that incurred losses in the earlier years. If, as the appellant contends, it is a different entity, there is a question as to what happened to the original entity. The three main indicia of continuity for the purposes of Part IX are the constitution of the trusts under which the fund (if a trust fund) operated, the trust property , and membership . Changes in one or more of those matters must be such as to terminate the existence of the eligible entity, or to produce the result that it does not derive the income in question, to destroy the necessary continuity. The trusts under which the fund operated in 1994-95 were constituted by the original trust deed in 1988 as varied by the exercise, in 1993, of a power of amendment. The property the subject of the trusts did not alter at the time the amendments took effect. Persons who were members of the fund before the amendments remained members of the fund after the amendments. The fund, both before and after the amendments, was administered as a single fund, and treated in that way by the regulatory authority. 
 [emphasis added]

Although the Court framed those three indicia of continuity "for the purposes of Part IX " of the 1936 Act in the context of a superannuation trust, the notion of continuity in the trust estate that derived the income or made the capital gain and that incurred the loss on revenue account or suffered the capital loss also determines the availability of the allowable deduction or the application of previously unapplied capital losses. There is no reason to believe that these three indicia of continuity do not equally apply to trust estates for the purposes of Division 6 of Part III of the 1936 Act and the 1997 Act.

The Commissioner contends that the arrangements of June 1993 brought about a break in continuity firstly in the trust fund; secondly, in the trustee's interest in the trust estate; and thirdly, in the interests of the beneficiaries in the trust fund. Continuity in the Trust Fund

Mr Denoon and Mr Clark intended however that the CU Trust continue in operation. It was necessary for Mr Clark's purposes that it do so. Both men proceeded on the footing that Mr Denoon "hoped" to be able to make a matching contribution to the CU Trust by 30 June 1995. In the period between 24 June 1993 and 30 June 1995, they investigated potential property development projects to be undertaken by the CU Trust for the long term, during the period of Mr Denoon's consultancy. The question that arises is whether the suspension arrangements and the effect upon the administration of the trust by CEPL from 24 June 1993 brought about changes in the interests of the unitholders, that is, the rights attaching to membership of the trust, so as to destroy the necessary continuity in the trust fund that made the capital gain in the 2001 income year and that which suffered the capital loss in the 1993 income year. Did the changes terminate the existence of the CU Trust or produce the result that it did not make the capital gain in question? Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (2001) 75 ALJR 1172 at [36].

The points along the continuum were these.

The Rothwells shares were acquired in the 1988 financial year. They rapidly lost value. They were sold by the trustee on 26 May 1993 giving rise to a CGT disposal and a capital loss. On 24 June 1993 the suspension arrangements were put in place pending the realisation of either an expectation or a hope of Mr Denoon's matching contribution. By 27 July 1994, Gemridge had made it plain to the trustee that it could not make a matching contribution and on 27 June 1995 the trustee agreed to the transfer of the Denoon units to Clark Holdings. The transfers were signed on 26 April 1996. In 1997, the Gladstone properties were acquired and in the 2001 income year the CU Trust realised a capital gain upon the disposal of those properties. All of the units in the CU Trust on 26 May 1993 were held by the Denoon interests. By the arrangements of 24 June 1993, 50% of those units were transferred to the Clark interests. The Denoon interests retained 50% of the issued units although the joint venture arrangements placed the rights attaching to those units, in practical terms, in suspension.</text>

<tocase>Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight (1979) 144 CLR 360</tocase>
<text>The right of indemnity Carringbush enjoyed out of trust assets in respect of liabilities incurred in performing the trust confers upon the trustee a "beneficial interest" in the trust assets: Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight (1979) 144 CLR 360 at 367 per Stephen, Mason, Aickin and Wilson JJ. However, the right of indemnity Carringbush enjoyed was in any meaningful sense, illusory as the trust fund consisted of significant accumulated losses ultimately rendering the trust in terms of any activities, dormant. Mr Clark was not prepared to make a contribution to the trust fund that would be immediately susceptible to the former trustee's indemnity claim and thus there would not have been any future contribution in respect of which the liability of the original trust estate to the former trustee became altered. Whilst the deed purported to extinguish the beneficial interest of the trustee by discharging or extinguishing the underlying right of indemnity and thus alter an aspect of the beneficial interests in the trust assets, the measure of that right was, in all practical senses, valueless having regard to the state of the trust fund.

The Commissioner contends that the right of indemnity as it subsisted in the trustee prior to extinguishment meant that the trust property was valueless to the unitholders and the extinguishment changed that "state of affairs" by enhancing the value of the assets from the perspective of the unitholders and freeing the trust estate (including future contributions) from any claim. Thus, the trust property was fundamentally altered.

The trustee of the trust may be replaced.

The second break in continuity is said to arise out of the discharge of the trustee's right of indemnity on the footing that the discharge altered the trustee's interest in the trust estate. The trustee's right of indemnity constitutes a beneficial interest in the trust assets: Octavo Investments Pty Ltd v Knight (supra at [107] of these reasons). The right of indemnity continues notwithstanding the trustee's retirement from office and creditors of the trustee are entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity. The new trustee takes the trust property subject to the right of indemnity of its predecessor in office. The right of indemnity is consistent with the right of reimbursement conferred by s 59(4) of the Trustees Act 1925 (NSW) which applied to the CU Trust. The Commissioner says that the right of indemnity conferred as a matter of law is not capable of being excluded from the trust instrument: Kemtron Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) [1984] 1 QdR 576 at p 585. The Commissioner contends that the waiver of the right of indemnity was not brought about by any authorised amendment of the Trust Deed. Two things are said to flow from this. Firstly, the waiver of the former trustee's right of indemnity brought about a material change in the rights and obligations attaching to the trust property which was inconsistent with the continuity of the trust estate for tax purposes. Secondly, the release of the former trustee's right of indemnity is properly understood as an agreement which gave rise to a new trust in the same terms as the CU Trust absent the term as to indemnity and thus a new trust was brought into existence for the purposes of the general law.</text>
