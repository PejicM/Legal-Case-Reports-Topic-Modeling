<text>1 This is an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court: SZDDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1174. The appellant, a citizen of India, applied for a protection visa which was refused. That decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal but the Tribunal's decision was set aside by a consent order of the Full Court. On the second hearing of the review by a Tribunal differently constituted the refusal of the appellant's application was again confirmed.

2 On the appeal to the Federal Magistrate, it appears that the grounds relied on were, first, the appellant did not have a fair hearing before the Tribunal and, secondly, that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it "took advantage of the situation created by the interpreter" which led to the appellant putting himself in a "scary situation". In essence, the Magistrate found that there was no evidence to support the allegations of the appellant. I shall not repeat the full discussion of the appellant's claims by the Magistrate which are set out in his decision which is obtainable on the Internet.</text>
