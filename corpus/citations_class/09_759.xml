<tocase>AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/642.html</AustLII>
<text>I reject this submission for the same reasons I rejected the same submission in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 (" AA "). In that case, I said (at [45]-[48]): 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons. The applicant submits that if this proposition is correct then it follows that the Statement should set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4) either because the words 'otherwise given, a summons' in s 29B(1) have a different meaning from the same words used in s 29A(3), or because a person 'otherwise given, a summons' can fall within the terms of both s 29B(1) on the one hand and s 29B(2) and (4) on the other. 

 
 The respondents submit that the Act creates two classes, namely, a class of persons served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, and a class of persons to whom disclosure is made by a person in the first class or by a person otherwise in the second class. The obligations and rights of the first class are set out in s 29B(1) and (2) and the obligations and rights of the second class are set out in s 29B(3) and (4). On this analysis, the written statement referred to in s 29A(3) must set out the obligations and rights set out in s 29B(1) and (2), but need not set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4). 

 
 In my opinion, the construction of s 29A and s 29B of the ACC Act advanced by the respondents is the correct one. First, the respondents' construction means the words 'otherwise given, the summons' are given the same meaning in the two sections. Secondly, the construction is consistent with the distinction suggested by the structure of s 29B between a person directly involved with the Commission or an examiner in that he or she has been served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, on the one hand, and a person to whom disclosure has been made, on the other. Thirdly, the respondents' construction avoids the practical difficulties that the applicant's construction creates in terms of the obligation placed on the Chief Executive Officer of the Commission by s 29A(5). 

 
 This issue was also an issue considered by Jagot J in SS . Again, I have reached my conclusions independently of her Honour's decision. However, with respect, her Honour's reasons neatly summarise why in this case the applicant's submission must be rejected and I take the liberty of repeating them. Her Honour said (at [123]-[127]):
 
 'Three matters are apparent from this scheme. 
 
 
 First, the scheme distinguishes between a person 'served, or otherwise given' a summons or notice and a person to whom a person 'served, or otherwise given' a summons or notice makes disclosure. The former is subject to ss 29B(1) and (2). The latter is subject to ss 29B(3) and/or (4). Consideration of the opening words of the provisions of ss 29B(1) to (4) supports this distinction (that is, the fact that s 29B(1) uses the words "served, or otherwise given" whereas ss 29B(3) and (4) refer to persons to whom disclosure has been made or information disclosed). This distinction indicates that the Act establishes two classes of persons for the purpose of these provisions, namely: - (i) persons who are served or otherwise given a summons or notice, and (ii) persons who are the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice, but who have not themselves been served or otherwise given a summons. This scheme is inconsistent with SS's case that the words 'otherwise given' in s 29A(3) should be read as applying to a person who is the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice. 
 
 Second, treating a person to whom disclosure has been made about a summons or notice as a person 'otherwise given' the summons or notice under s 29A(3) undermines the careful scheme of obligations imposed by s 29B. The reason for this is that the words 'or otherwise given' must take the same meaning wherever they appear in the ACC Act. Hence, s 29B(1), on SS's construction, would apply to a person to whom disclosure is made (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) under s 29B(2). Yet such a person would also be subject to the obligations imposed by s 29B(3). Similarly, if that person to whom disclosure is made under s 29B(2) (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) themselves makes a disclosure under s 29B(4) (and happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) the person who is the recipient of the disclosure under s 29B(4) would also become a person subject to the obligations under s 29B(3), yet also (on SS's case) s 29B(1) as well. This makes the statutory scheme nonsensical. 
 
 Third, and as the ACC pointed out, if SS's construction is correct then the CEO's obligation in s 29A(5) is unworkable. The CEO will know the persons served or otherwise given the summons by the ACC. The CEO cannot know the persons to whom a disclosure has been made in accordance with ss 29B(2) or (4). Such a disclosure is not a matter for the CEO. It is a matter for the person served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and the recipient of the disclosure. Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 

 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted.'" 

 
"SS" is the decision of Jagot J in SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474.
 Reasons adequacy of record

In AA , I considered whether s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act applied to an examiner's obligation in s 28(1A) of the Act to record in writing the reasons for his or her decision to issue a summons. I held that it did not. I said (at [29]-[30]): 
 "For s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act to be engaged, it must be established that s 28(1A) of the ACC Act imposes an obligation on an examiner to give written reasons for his or her decision to issue a summons. In my opinion, the applicant cannot establish that matter. Section 28 does not impose an obligation on an examiner to give reasons to an examinee or to give the written record of his reasons to an examinee: Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356. That decision was not challenged by the applicant. In the course of his decision in that case, Finn J said (at 363-364 [28]-[29]): 

 
 'It is important to note that the present application is not one for judicial review of the examiner's decision. Rather it asserts an entitlement to be provided with Mr Boulton's record of reasons &#8212; an entitlement the satisfaction of which is said to be a precondition to the holding of the examination. The short answer to the claim is that s 28(1A) in its setting gives no such right expressly and there is no conceivable basis in this context for implying such a right: cf R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 166 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 686 ff; let alone for making the provision of such reasons a jurisdictional precondition to the holding of an examination. Neither context nor legislative purpose: cf Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 585 at [11] ; and see generally Spigelman, 'The poet's rich resource: Issues in statutory interpretation' (2001) 21 Aust Bar Rev 224 ; lend any support to such an implication. 

 
 The legislative judgment not to provide a right to reasons can only be regarded as deliberate, the more so as the ACC Act contemplates that decisions under this Act may be the subject of an application under the ADJR Act: s 57; but the ADJR [sic] gives no right to reasons under s 13 for such decisions. The clear purpose of s 28(1A) is both to focus and enhance decision making and to provide an accountability mechanism by requiring the creation of an 'audit trail'. Under s 59 of the ACC Act, that record is potentially available on request to the portfolio Minister and to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission that is constituted under Pt III of the ACC Act: and see ss 54 and 55 for that Committee's powers and duties. As is not uncommon with investigative agencies, the Parliament has counterbalanced the secrecy regime it has erected to ensure the effectiveness of the ACC's investigations with a measure of public accountability through a dedicated parliamentary oversight committee: see eg Intelligence Services Act 2001 (Cth). A right such as the applicant propounds would be an alien presence in such a statutory scheme.' 

 
 In my opinion, an obligation to record in writing the reasons for a decision or act (which is the obligation imposed by s 28(1A) of the ACC Act) is quite different from an obligation to give written reasons for a decision (which is the obligation postulated by s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act ). The latter, no doubt, includes giving written reasons to the person affected by the decision and publishing written reasons. The obligation in s 28(1A) to record in writing the reasons for the issue of a summons does not engage the obligation in s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act to set out in an instrument giving the reasons the findings on material questions of fact and to refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings are based."

As in AA , I do not think that s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act was engaged in relation to an examiner's obligation to record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons. Even if that is wrong, and it was engaged, a failure to comply with it would not lead to the invalidity of the summons by reason of s 28(8)(a). Reasons exercise of power

The Act required the second respondent to be satisfied that it was reasonable in all the circumstances to issue the second summons: s 28(1A). The applicant made a number of complaints about the second respondent's reasons which I think, when properly analysed, were challenges to his decision to issue the second summons.

There were no detailed submissions on the grounds upon which the decision to issue a summons under s 28(1) may be challenged on an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act . I gave brief consideration to some of the issues which arise in AA (at [13]-[18]). I propose to proceed on the basis that if the second respondent's decision involved any of the matters which constitute jurisdictional error then it is invalid (see Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 176-180).

In AA , the applicants applied for interlocutory injunctions restraining the holding of their examinations and I heard the applications after judgment was reserved in this proceeding. One of the determinations which was challenged in that case was in fact made at the Board meeting held on 25 June 2008 and Mr Negus signed the determination as Chair of the Board. The same argument was put as is put in this case and the same letter from Mr Keelty to Mr Negus dated 3 June 2008 was relied on by the respondents for the purposes of s 19(1) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) ("AFP Act").

I held that Mr Negus had and was able to exercise all the powers and was required to perform all the functions and duties of the Commissioner on 25 June 2008. The Commissioner's letter dated 3 June 2008 established that he was absent from Australia and that Mr Negus was the next most senior member who was available. By virtue of s 19(4), the order of seniority was as determined by the Commissioner and it was a reasonable inference from the letter that the Commissioner had determined that Mr Negus was the next most senior member who was available.

In AA , I rejected a submission that s 19(1) only operated in relation to powers, functions and duties under the AFP Act. I said (at [60]): 
 "The applicant submits that s 19(1) is restricted to powers, functions and duties under the AFP Act and does not authorise the next most senior member to perform the role of presiding over a meeting of the Board under the ACC Act. The applicant referred to s 69C of the AFP Act in support of his argument. This section gives the Commissioner the power to delegate in writing to certain officers, all or any of the Commissioner's powers, functions or duties under the Act. I am unable to see how s 69C assists in the interpretation of s 19 of the AFP Act, which must be construed according to its terms. The applicant also referred to s 17(4) of the AFP Act, which provides that the Commissioner holds office on such terms and conditions (if any) in respect of matters not provided for by the Act as are determined by the Governor-General. The applicant suggested that this subsection is directed to powers, functions and duties of the Commissioner under other Acts. I do not think that is right. Section 17(4) is directed to terms and conditions of the Commissioner's office not provided for (that is, not dealt with) in the AFP Act. They are to be determined by the Governor-General. In my opinion, the words in s 19(1) of the AFP Act are quite general and there is no reason to restrict them to powers, functions and duties under the AFP Act." 

 
The same conclusion applies in this case.

On 25 June 2008, Mr Negus was performing, for the time being, the duties of the office or position of Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. In AA , the respondents submitted that fact engaged s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act , which is in the following terms: 
 "20 Mention of an officer in general terms 
 Where in an Act any person holding or occupying a particular office or position is mentioned or referred to in general terms, such mention or reference shall unless the contrary intention appears be deemed to include all persons who at any time occupy for the time being, or perform for the time being the duties of, the said office or position." 

 
I accepted that argument. I said (at [62]-[64]):
 
 "The applicant submits that s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is not engaged by s 7B(3) and s 7E of the ACC Act because the reference to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in s 7B(3) is not a mention or reference to a person holding or occupying a particular office or position in general terms . The submission is that a mention or reference in an Act to, for example, a director of a company or an officer of an organisation would be a mention or reference in general terms, but a mention or reference to an office occupied by one person is not a mention or reference in general terms . 

 
 A similar issue arose in the case I have heard (see [12]) and I had the benefit of detailed submissions on the point in that case. Both parties referred me to the submissions in that case. 

 
 In my opinion, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is mentioned or referred to in the ACC Act in general terms , such that the deeming provision in s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is engaged. I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons. First, there are some authorities that touch on s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act and, so far as they go, they suggest that there is no distinction of the type advanced by the applicant: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 75 per Gummow J; Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations v Barker (1997) 81 FCR 53 ; Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [44] per Bennett J; Gazal Apparel Pty Ltd v Davies (2007) 247 LSJS 391 at 396 [35] per Doyle CJ. Secondly, the subject of what is to be mentioned or referred to in general terms is not the office or position itself, but the person holding or occupying a particular office or position. There is no reason why that should be restricted only to those cases where the person is a member of a class of persons. The distinction suggested by the applicant seems to me to be an artificial one. It is not obvious why the deeming provision in s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act would apply in the case of a deputy commissioner of an organisation, assuming there were two or more deputy commissioners, but not apply in the case of the commissioner of an organisation, or why it would not apply to a person lower down in the hierarchy of an organisation who happens to be the only holder of a particular office or position. Such, however, are the consequences of the interpretation of s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act proposed by the applicant. Finally, the interpretation of s 20 which I think is the correct one, will not frustrate or impede the intention of Parliament because the deeming provision itself does not apply if a contrary intention appears in the relevant legislation. I should add that I do not think the ACC Act reveals a contrary intention in this case."

The same conclusion applies in this case, subject to my consideration of the applicant's submission that the Act reveals a contrary intention. He referred to the composition of the Board (s 7B(2)), its important functions (s 7C), the quorum and voting requirements (s 7F and s 7G) and the provisions dealing with the passing of resolutions outside of Board meetings (s 7J). He submitted that the Act contains only a limited power to delegate (s 59A) and that the Commissioner's power in s 7E(b) of the Act to nominate a person to preside at a meeting of the Board is quite limited. To a point, those matters may be accepted, but I do not think that they reveal a contrary intention within s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act .

The applicant also submitted that if each State Act had an equivalent to s 19(1) of the AFP Act (a matter which was not established) then a consequence of the respondents' argument is that the Board might, at a particular meeting, be composed of quite junior members. It seems to me that is an unlikely possibility, but, in any event it can be said on the other side that it is unlikely that Parliament intended that the Board be unable to transact its business in the event that, for example, a number of police commissioners are absent from duty or from Australia.

The determination is not invalid because Mr Negus was Chair of the Board meeting held on 25 June 2008. Purpose of the investigation

Clause 9 of the determination sets out the purpose of the investigation (see [22] above).</text>

<tocase>A B Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 107 ALD 591</tocase>
<text>The applicant submitted that, by reason of s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act , the second respondent was required to set out in his reasons his findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and that he had not done that. It was not in this case contended by the respondents, as it had been by the respondents (albeit in the context of s 29 of the Act) in A B Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 107 ALD 591 at 607 [54] per Flick J, that s 25D was engaged. I do not need to examine the question of whether the second respondent set out his findings or material questions of fact and referred to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based because, in my opinion, s 25D was not engaged and, even if it was, a failure to comply with its provisions would not lead to the conclusion that the second summons is invalid.

Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act provides as follows: 
 " 25D Content of statements of reasons for decisions 

 
 Where an Act requires a tribunal, body or person making a decision to give written reasons for the decision, whether the expression 'reasons', 'grounds' or any other expression is used, the instrument giving the reasons shall also set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based."</text>

<tocase>A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101 ; (2004) 136 FCR 420</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/101.html</AustLII>
<text>The first ground of challenge to the second summons is that it failed to state that the applicant was required to give evidence as a "witness". It is submitted that the second summons was therefore deficient "on its face". The applicant referred to various sections in the Act which refer to a person appearing before an examiner in response to a summons as a witness: ss 25A(6), (7) and (8), 26 , 27 , 28 (heading), 30 and 31 . I leave to one side the fact that a section heading is not part of an Act: Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (" Acts Interpretation Act ") s 13(3). There is nothing in the Act which requires a summons to state that the person to whom it is directed is required to give evidence as a witness. It is not clear to me whether, by making this submission, the applicant was suggesting that he could only be required to give evidence as a witness in the sense that he could not be required to give evidence of his own activities or involvement in the activities of others. If he was suggesting that, it is plainly not a proposition supported by the provisions of the Act. The provisions of the Act have the effect of removing the privilege against self-incrimination: s 30(4) and (5) (see A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101 ; (2004) 136 FCR 420). A copy of the determination

The second ground of challenge to the second summons is that it was not accompanied by a copy of the determination. The Act provides that a copy of the determination must accompany the summons: s 28(2).

This ground of challenge was not the subject of any submissions by the applicant. It must be rejected because the evidence tendered by the applicant included evidence from his solicitor that he was served with the second summons and it was accompanied by a copy of the determination.

<tocase>Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86</tocase>
<text>The summons itself refers to a special investigation and it has the determination attached to it. The determination plainly relates to a special investigation. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances document refers to a special investigation and to the determination and the Legal Submissions document refers to the determination and to a special investigation. It seems to me that, looking at the documents as a whole, it has not been established that the second respondent misunderstood the nature of the instrument pursuant to which he was issuing the summons. It is more likely that some of the dangers of using a standard form document have been realised (see the observations of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86 at [34]).

The second ground upon which the applicant challenged the second respondent's decision to issue the second summons was that he misunderstood the exercise he was performing. The applicant referred to the fact that the Legal Submissions document is referred to under the heading, "Material Facts" and to the fact that in one part of the reasons he states that he had regard to "&#169; My knowledge obtained from a recent examination" and yet when setting out his conclusions under the heading "Consideration" he makes no reference to that piece of information. It seems to me that, however one looks at those matters, neither of them establishes an error which is a jurisdictional error.

The third ground upon which the applicant challenged the second respondent's decision to issue the second summons is that the second respondent did not consider, or properly consider, the inclusion of the notation referred to in s 29A of the Act. In formulating his reasons for including the notation, there is nothing to prevent the second respondent from relying on each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in s 29A(2) (see [35] above). Furthermore, it is clear from the reference in paragraph 6), "in the terms approved by me", (see [8] above) that he addressed the terms of the notation.</text>

<text>I was told by the parties that there is no case which determines in an authoritative way the scope and effect of s 16. The section was referred to in passing in P v Board of Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCAFC 54 ; (2006) 151 FCR 114 at 121 [24] - [26] and D v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 660 ; (2006) 152 FCR 497 at 503 [31] per Mansfield J.

The submission was considered by Mansfield J in D v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 660 ; (2006) 152 FCR 497 at [28] - [60] and rejected. With respect, I think his Honour's decision is correct and I will follow it.

The determination is not invalid because it does not identify the class or classes of persons to participate in the investigation. Consent to conferral of State powers</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<text>The respondents referred to Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 and submitted that s 16 was engaged in circumstances where the determination was not lawfully made because of an error of law which did not go to jurisdiction, or because of a failure to comply with a provision of the Act which was not an inviolable jurisdictional restraint. In other words, they accepted that s 16 was not engaged where the determination was not lawfully made because of jurisdictional error, or a failure to comply with an inviolable jurisdictional restraint. I do not need to consider the scope and effect of s 16 because I do not think any of the grounds upon which the determination is challenged are made out.

I turn now to examine those grounds. Chair of the Board

The Act deals with the composition of the Board and it provides for a Board composed of 14 members with the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as Chair of the Board: s 7B. The Chair has various powers and functions in relation to meetings of the Board. He or she may convene meetings of the Board: s 7D. He or she must preside over meetings of the Board: s 7E(a). There is one exception to this last requirement. A person who is another eligible Commonwealth Board member (defined in s 4) and who is nominated, in writing, by the Chair may preside over a meeting of the Board if the Chair is not present: s 7E(b).</text>

<tocase>R v Hughes (2000) 202 CLR 535</tocase>
<text>The Commission is a Commonwealth authority created under Commonwealth legislation. On the face of it, the Commission cannot perform or exercise duties, functions or powers under State laws without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament: Bond v The Queen [2000] HCA 13 ; (2000) 201 CLR 213 at 219 [15] . Section 55A is designed to give that legislative consent in certain circumstances. The section relevantly provides: 
 " Object 
 (1) The main object of this section is to give legislative consent to the conferral on:
 (a) the ACC; or
 (b) the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC; or
 (c) a Judge of the Federal Court or a Federal Magistrate;
 of certain duties, functions and powers under State laws. 

 
 ACC 
 (2) A law of a State may confer on the ACC any or all of the following duties, functions or powers:
 (a) the function of investigating a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity in so far as the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State (irrespective of whether that offence or those offences have a federal aspect);
 (b) a duty, function or power that is for the purposes of an investigation referred to in paragraph (a) and that is either:
 (i) of the same kind as a duty, function or power conferred on the ACC by this Act or any other Act (whether or not the last-mentioned duty, function or power relates to the investigation of that matter); or
 (ii) of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph;
 (c) the function of undertaking an intelligence operation in so far as the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State (irrespective of whether that offence or those offences have a federal aspect);
 (d) a duty, function or power that is for the purposes of an operation referred to in paragraph (c) and that is either:
 (i) of the same kind as a duty, function or power conferred on the ACC by this Act or any other Act (whether or not the last-mentioned duty, function or power relates to that operation); or
 (ii) of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph.
 (3) The ACC cannot, under a law of a State:
 (a) investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or
 (b) undertake an intelligence operation;
 unless the Board has consented to the ACC doing so. 

 
 Inter-Governmental Committee, Board, Chair of the Board, members of the Board, CEO, examiners and members of staff of the ACC 
 (4) A law of a State may confer on the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC a duty, function or power that:
 (a) relates to the investigation of a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity in so far as the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State (irrespective of whether that offence or those offences have a federal aspect); and
 (b) is either:
 (i) of the same kind as a duty, function or power conferred on the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC by this Act or any other Act (whether or not the last-mentioned duty, function or power relates to the investigation of that matter); or
 (ii) of a kind specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph.
 (5) A law of a State may confer on the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC a duty, function or power that:
 (a) relates to the undertaking of an intelligence operation in so far as the relevant crime is, or the relevant crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the State (irrespective of whether that offence or those offences have a federal aspect); and
 (b) is either:
 (i) of the same kind as a duty, function or power conferred on the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Board, the Chair of the Board, a member of the Board, the CEO, an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC by this Act or any other Act (whether or not the last-mentioned duty, function or power relates to that operation); or

 ...
 (7) Subsections (2), (4), (5), (5B) and (5C) do not extend to a law of a State to the extent to which that law purports to confer any duty that is in contravention of any constitutional doctrine restricting the duties that may be conferred on:
 (a) authorities of the Commonwealth; or
 (b) members of authorities of the Commonwealth; or
 (c) Judges of a court created by the Parliament.
 ...
 (14) In this section (other than subsection (9)):
 intelligence operation means the collection, correlation, analysis or dissemination of criminal information and intelligence relating to a relevant criminal activity."

<tocase>SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474</tocase>
<text>I reject this submission for the same reasons I rejected the same submission in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 (" AA "). In that case, I said (at [45]-[48]): 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons. The applicant submits that if this proposition is correct then it follows that the Statement should set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4) either because the words 'otherwise given, a summons' in s 29B(1) have a different meaning from the same words used in s 29A(3), or because a person 'otherwise given, a summons' can fall within the terms of both s 29B(1) on the one hand and s 29B(2) and (4) on the other. 

 
 The respondents submit that the Act creates two classes, namely, a class of persons served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, and a class of persons to whom disclosure is made by a person in the first class or by a person otherwise in the second class. The obligations and rights of the first class are set out in s 29B(1) and (2) and the obligations and rights of the second class are set out in s 29B(3) and (4). On this analysis, the written statement referred to in s 29A(3) must set out the obligations and rights set out in s 29B(1) and (2), but need not set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4). 

 
 In my opinion, the construction of s 29A and s 29B of the ACC Act advanced by the respondents is the correct one. First, the respondents' construction means the words 'otherwise given, the summons' are given the same meaning in the two sections. Secondly, the construction is consistent with the distinction suggested by the structure of s 29B between a person directly involved with the Commission or an examiner in that he or she has been served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, on the one hand, and a person to whom disclosure has been made, on the other. Thirdly, the respondents' construction avoids the practical difficulties that the applicant's construction creates in terms of the obligation placed on the Chief Executive Officer of the Commission by s 29A(5). 

 
 This issue was also an issue considered by Jagot J in SS . Again, I have reached my conclusions independently of her Honour's decision. However, with respect, her Honour's reasons neatly summarise why in this case the applicant's submission must be rejected and I take the liberty of repeating them. Her Honour said (at [123]-[127]):
 
 'Three matters are apparent from this scheme. 
 
 
 First, the scheme distinguishes between a person 'served, or otherwise given' a summons or notice and a person to whom a person 'served, or otherwise given' a summons or notice makes disclosure. The former is subject to ss 29B(1) and (2). The latter is subject to ss 29B(3) and/or (4). Consideration of the opening words of the provisions of ss 29B(1) to (4) supports this distinction (that is, the fact that s 29B(1) uses the words "served, or otherwise given" whereas ss 29B(3) and (4) refer to persons to whom disclosure has been made or information disclosed). This distinction indicates that the Act establishes two classes of persons for the purpose of these provisions, namely: - (i) persons who are served or otherwise given a summons or notice, and (ii) persons who are the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice, but who have not themselves been served or otherwise given a summons. This scheme is inconsistent with SS's case that the words 'otherwise given' in s 29A(3) should be read as applying to a person who is the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice. 
 
 Second, treating a person to whom disclosure has been made about a summons or notice as a person 'otherwise given' the summons or notice under s 29A(3) undermines the careful scheme of obligations imposed by s 29B. The reason for this is that the words 'or otherwise given' must take the same meaning wherever they appear in the ACC Act. Hence, s 29B(1), on SS's construction, would apply to a person to whom disclosure is made (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) under s 29B(2). Yet such a person would also be subject to the obligations imposed by s 29B(3). Similarly, if that person to whom disclosure is made under s 29B(2) (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) themselves makes a disclosure under s 29B(4) (and happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) the person who is the recipient of the disclosure under s 29B(4) would also become a person subject to the obligations under s 29B(3), yet also (on SS's case) s 29B(1) as well. This makes the statutory scheme nonsensical. 
 
 Third, and as the ACC pointed out, if SS's construction is correct then the CEO's obligation in s 29A(5) is unworkable. The CEO will know the persons served or otherwise given the summons by the ACC. The CEO cannot know the persons to whom a disclosure has been made in accordance with ss 29B(2) or (4). Such a disclosure is not a matter for the CEO. It is a matter for the person served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and the recipient of the disclosure. Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 

 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted.'" 

 
"SS" is the decision of Jagot J in SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474.
 Reasons adequacy of record

I went on to say that, even if s 25D applied, a failure to set out findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based would not, because of s 28(8) , lead to invalidity. I said (at [31]-[34]): 
 "The applicant's argument must fail for another reason, even if (contrary to my conclusion) s 28(1A) of the ACC Act engaged the obligation in s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act . If I assume s 25D was engaged and I assume the examiner's reasons did not satisfy the requirements of s 25D , the applicant's argument must nevertheless fail because s 28(8)(a) of the ACC Act provides that a failure to comply with s 28(1A), 'in so far as that subsection relates to the making of a record' does not affect the validity of a summons. The applicant submits that s 28(8)(a) only relates to the time when the record is made. In other words, the applicant submits that s 28(8)(a) is only engaged where the record is not prepared at one of the times specified in s 28(1A)(a), (b) and (c). It is not engaged, so the argument proceeds, where the failure relates to the contents of the record. I see no justification for drawing such a distinction. The words describing the failure as one relating to the 'making of [the] record' are wide enough to cover obligations both as to the time at which the record is made and as to its contents. 

 
 The applicant referred to the fact that the provisions specifying times in s 28(1A), that is to say (a), (b) and (c), were part of the same amendment, that is, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act (No 168 of 2007 ) (Cth), which introduced s 28(8). The applicant submits that I should infer from that fact that s 28(8)(a) relates only to the time at which the reasons are to be recorded in writing. I was referred to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007. I reject this contention. For the reasons I have given, there is no reason to read down the words in s 28(8)(a) and in fact the Explanatory Memorandum supports the construction which I think is the proper one. The explanation for the introduction of s 28(8) of the ACC Act is as follows: 

 
 'Item 5 

 
 Subsections 28(1A) and 28(2) and section 29A prescribe a range of technical requirements for issuing a summons under subsection 28(1). 

 
 Subsection 28(1A) requires an examiner to record in writing the reasons for the issue of the notice. 

 
 Subsection 28(2) provides that a summons issued under subsection 28(1) must be accompanied by a copy of the determination by the ACC Board that the intelligence operation is a special operation, or that the investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation. 

 
 Section 29A sets out the circumstances in which an examiner who issues a summons under section 28 is required to include in the summons a notation to the effect that the disclosure of information about the summons, or any official matters connected with it, is prohibited (except in circumstances specified in the notice). The section sets out when a notation must or may be made, prescribes the form and content of the notation, and provides for cancellation of the notation. 

 
 This item adds a new subsection 28(8) to the ACC Act to provide that a failure to comply with the requirements set out in subsections 28(1A) to the extent that the subsection relates to the making of a record and 28(2) and section 29A of the ACC Act does not render a summons issued under subsection 28(1) invalid. 

 
 The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that ACC operations/investigations are not undermined by reason of an examiner's failure to comply with these technical requirements. 

 
 This provision does not apply to substantive procedural obligations, such as the requirements under subsection 28(1A) that the examiner must be satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to issue the summons and under subsection 28(3) that the summons should, other than in limited circumstances, set out the general nature of the matters in relation to which the examiner intends to question the person.' 

 
 I do not think the second ground has sufficient prospects of success to justify an interlocutory injunction restraining the examiner from conducting the proposed examination of the applicant. 

 
 The issues raised in the second ground were the same as issues considered by Jagot J in SS . I have decided the issues in the same way as her Honour (see [88]-[92])."</text>
