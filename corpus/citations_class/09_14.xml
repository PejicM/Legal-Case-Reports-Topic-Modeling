<tocase>Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121</tocase>

<text>13 A management investment scheme is defined in s 9 of the Act. In essence, it requires a "program or plan of action": see Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 at 129, which involves the pooling of funds of a number of persons: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Enterprise Solutions 2000 Pty Ltd (2000) 35 ACSR 620. There must be consideration for the pooling of funds in the grant of rights or interests to benefits to be generated from the use of those funds: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [2001] WASC 339 at [46] . The scheme must therefore contemplate the generation of benefits under a common enterprise that is, financial benefits or benefits which are rights or interests in property from the funds contributed. And, the contributors should not have the day to day control of the operations of the scheme, ie they should not engage in the acts which constitute its management or the carrying out of its activities: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 310 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [55] .</text>
