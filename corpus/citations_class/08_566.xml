<text>1 In this matter on 27 March 2008 reasons for decision were published allowing an appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal given on 3 October 2007: Comcare v Davies [2008] FCA 393.

2 One of the orders then made was that the decision of the Tribunal was to be set aside. Liberty was reserved for the parties to apply within seven days should one or the other seek to have the orders varied. That liberty was not invoked but the orders as made on 27 March 2008 have not yet been entered.

3 Today, however, an oral application was made in accordance with O 35(7)(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) to vary Order 3 as made on 27 March 2008. The application is supported by both parties.</text>
