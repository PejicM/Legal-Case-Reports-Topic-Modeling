<text>20 As has been repeatedly pointed out, judicial review of an administrative decision -- let alone judicial review confined to jurisdictional error -- does not extend to a review of the merits of a decision: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1. Brennan J there observed at 35 6:
 The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone. 
These observations have been oft cited with approval: eg, Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. Even a wrong finding of fact alone does not constitute an error of law: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [137] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 560 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

<tocase>SZJLH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 2067</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/2067.html</AustLII>
<text>23 On that occasion there was no appearance by either of the now Appellants and the application was dismissed pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth): SZJLH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 2067.

24 Any continuing significance as to the events of 28 November 2007, however, remains elusive. As set forth in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court now under appeal, an application was made on 12 February 2008 to vacate the orders previously made and, on that occasion, the Federal Magistrate in fact vacated the orders as requested and proceeded to hear and resolve the case then sought to be advanced.

25 There is no procedural unfairness in either the Federal Magistrate initially dismissing the application in November 2007, when the now Appellants failed to appear, and certainly no procedural unfairness in the Federal Magistrate thereafter, in February 2008, entertaining and resolving the arguments that were subsequently sought to be advanced. Whatever may have been the reasons for the now Appellants not previously appearing before the Federal Magistrates Court, they need not be further pursued; their case has been heard and determined by that Court in a procedurally fair manner.</text>

<text>4 The Federal Magistrates Court ultimately dismissed an application seeking to review the decision of the Tribunal: SZJLH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 175.

5 The Appellants now appeal to this Court from that decision. The Grounds of Appeal as set forth in the Notice of Appeal (without alteration) provide as follows:
 His Hon. Federal Magistartae Raphel FM failed to hold that the Refugee Review Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it misunderstood or misconstrued the term "religious belief" as it appears in the UN Refugee Convention . The RRT failed to appreciate that appellant suffered harm at the hands of Muslims opponents only because of his religious belief being a Hindu . The Tribunal did not understand the applicant's fear of harm and misaaplied the law-affected the Tribunal's application of law. The appellants claim that the Tribunal failed to assess the cumulative effects of separate incidents of attacks on the appellant related with his claim for the protection visa. The Appellants claim that they have fear of persecution . 2.The appellants were denied procedural fairness when Hon Federal Magistrate failed to consider that appellants did not attend the scheduled hearing on 28 November 2007 due to financial hardship . They were unable to pay airfare and train fare because of financial hardship . They could not inform the Court because the network in that countryside was not working . Hon. Federal Magistrate did not give any consideration to waive the Respondent's cost of $4500. Notwithstanding the numbering appearing in those grounds, it is considered that the Notice of Appeal raises three grounds.

6 There was, however, no appearance for the Appellants when the matter was called on for hearing at 2.20 pm this afternoon. The matter was then called outside the Court, but to no avail. The proceedings were stood down to 2.35 pm to accommodate the prospect that the Appellants may have been late in arriving. The matter was then called outside the Court but again to no avail. The interpreter who attended Court to assist the Appellants was requested to telephone the Appellants on the mobile phone number set forth in their Notice of Appeal . That number was dialled, but the mobile telephone was turned off.

7 Counsel for the First Respondent sought an order that the appeal be dismissed pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

8 Previously filed by the Appellants was a written Outline of Submissions which has been considered, as have the Respondent Minister's written submissions.</text>
