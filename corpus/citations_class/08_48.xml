<tocase>Bailey v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/11.html</AustLII>
<text>13 Subsequently, however, the High Court has held that despite having the burden of proof, the taxpayer is entitled to know the basis on which the Commissioner has made an assessment. In Bailey v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214, the High Court discussed the Commissioner's obligation to provide particulars in the context of s 260 of the ITAA. Barwick CJ observed, at 217 - 218:
 
 The taxpayer should be told the taxable facts. This inevitably, in my opinion, requires the Commissioner to inform the taxpayer of the operation of s 260 which has warranted the adoption of his view of the taxable facts. This involves the identification and disclosure of the contract, agreement or arrangement which has been treated as avoided by s 260 .... [T]he Commissioner must, in my opinion, be specific in his identification of the contract, agreement or arrangement ... which justifies the amount of the assessment.

14 In the same case Aicken J commented at 227:
 
 The purpose of particulars is to assist in the defining of issues and there is in my opinion no reason why in appropriate cases the Commissioner should not give particulars where they are necessary in order that both the appellant and the court may understand the basis upon which the assessment has been made. 
 ... 
 It is not in the interests of the proper administration of justice that, when the matter comes before the court, the appellant should have to speculate about, and adduce evidence to negate, every possible kind of agreement ...

15 In Bailey, the High Court did not regard the obligation to provide particulars as inconsistent with, or in any way compromising, the taxpayer's burden of proof. Rather their view was to the contrary. Gibbs J commented at 219 that:
 
 The fact that the taxpayer bears the onus of proving that the assessment is excessive makes it all the more necessary that he should be given particulars of the basis of the assessment. 

At 221 Mason J said that because the taxpayer has to prove that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive:
 
 ... the relevant facts in the appeal include the view of the facts on which the Commissioner has based his assessment, the manner in which he arrived at his assessment. These facts are not within the knowledge of the taxpayer; they are within the knowledge of the Commissioner. 

More recently, Greenwood J expressed a similar view in Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426 at [37] . Jacobs J acknowledged in Bailey that particulars are essentially factual rather than legal, however his Honour recognised that for a request for particulars to be appropriately directed to the matter in dispute the issues must be sufficiently defined. At 221-2, his Honour made the following comment:
 
 ... when there are no sufficiently defined issues it is not always possible to obtain particulars of facts without first ascertaining whether those facts will be relevant to questions which may be raised. In the present case it is therefore necessary for the taxpayer and the Court to know the basis of the assessments.</text>

<tocase>Jackson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 20 ATR 611</tocase>
<text>17 In outlining his conclusions on the application before him Sundberg J referred to Gummow J's comments in Jackson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 20 ATR 611 at 618 that the taxpayer was entitled to know both the Commission's view and the facts on which that view was based. His Honour also said that he was in agreement with an extra-judicial observation of Beaumont J that the Commissioner's statement "must propound all the necessary ingredients of the claim for which, as a matter of legal substance, that party contends" ("Anatomy of a Federal Court Tax Case" (2000)(23)(2) UNSW Law Journal 237 at 238-9) and added, at 342:
 
 It is now well-established that the statement takes the place of pleadings so that after the exchange of statements the parties to a tax appeal know the case each has to meet. A statement that leaves the taxpayer uncertain as to how the case is put against it is embarrassing and oppressive. A statement that does not disclose the facts on which the respondent has based his assessment and the manner in which he has arrived at it, suffers from these twin vices.</text>

<tocase>George v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1952] HCA 21 ; (1952) 86 CLR 183</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1952/21.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The Commissioner relies on s 14ZZO of the TAA which puts the onus on the applicant to prove the facts on which the applicant seeks to rely to show that the assessment is excessive and, unless the Court otherwise orders, limits the proceedings in this Court to the grounds stated in the taxation objection. In considering what the Commissioner must disclose in the appeal statements it is necessary to take account of the fact that the taxpayer has the burden of proof under s 14ZZO. This factor was also an issue in George v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1952] HCA 21 ; (1952) 86 CLR 183 which was the earliest case involving the Commissioner's obligation to provide particulars with respect to assessments, albeit that the question arose in the context of earlier legislation.

11 In George, the taxpayer claimed that his taxable income was less than the amount assessed by the Commissioner. He sought orders that the Commissioner furnish particulars of the source from which it was alleged that he had derived that income. Kitto J declined to make the orders sought on the basis that it was the taxpayer and not the Commissioner who had the burden of proving that the assessment was excessive. His Honour commented, at 189, that in order to discharge the burden of proof the taxpayer,
 
 must necessarily exclude by his proof all sources of income except those which he admits. His case must be that he did not derive from any source taxable income to the amount of the assessment.

12 The Full High Court (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ) dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Kitto J. In their joint judgment, at 203, the Court pointed out that:
 
 ... even were it true that the commissioner must ... affirmatively prove by evidence that he formed a judgment of the amount of the income upon which the appellant ought to be taxed, it could not be part of his case to establish the facts upon which he acted in forming the judgment or the grounds on which he proceeded, the materials before him, or the reasoning actuating him. The need supposed of showing that he formed such a judgment could be no ground for requiring particulars of the sources of the taxable income ascribed by the assessment to the appellant.</text>

<tocase>Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 55 ATR 321</tocase>
<text>16 In Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 55 ATR 321 there was, as here, a dispute as to whether the statement of facts, issues and contentions was so inadequate that it should be struck out or whether it would be sufficient to supplement it with particulars. In that case the Commissioner's statement listed the issues and contentions in a table against which the Commissioner indicated his position by a simple "yes" or "no". Sundberg J held that the deficiencies in the statement could not be cured by further particulars. His Honour noted, at 331, that the ultimate decision in the appeal before him would "turn on the facts established by the applicant, and not on those perceived and stated by the [Commissioner]" and rejected the claim that the applicant was seeking to invert the onus of proof.</text>

<tocase>WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 234 ALR 451</tocase>
<text>18 His Honour did not suggest that in taking the place of pleadings, the statement should be treated in the same way as pleadings. The difference between pleadings and a statement of facts, issues and contentions or an appeal statement was recognised by Lindgren J in WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 234 ALR 451 where his Honour stated unequivocally, at 459, that a statement of facts, issues and contentions is not a pleading even within the extended definition of "pleading" in O 1 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules .

19 Ultimately, however, what is clear from all of the authorities is that the issue is one of substance; the taxpayer, and the court, must be given a clear and succinct statement of the Commissioner's position without imposing any element of a burden of proof on the Commissioner. In substituting such a statement for pleadings the legislature has provided for a very practical approach to the unusual situation where the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive. In my view, such a statement should not be overly scrutinised in an attempt to find errors or inadequacies. The question is: does the statement give the taxpayer a practical understanding of the Commissioner's position?

20 The applicant's complaints about the inadequacies it perceived in the respondent's appeal statements are set out in detail in a letter dated 3 August 2007 from its solicitor to that of the respondent. While expressly not conceding that those deficiencies could be cured by further particulars, a request for further and better particulars was enclosed with the letter. In its response dated 17 August 2007, the respondent's solicitor declined to amend the statements but said that its client was prepared to give further particulars. Despite this, no further particulars had been given by the time of the hearing of the applicant's motions.</text>
