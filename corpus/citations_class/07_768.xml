<text>7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding. The objection to competency is plainly well taken. A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature. Pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be brought from such a decision without leave. See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J.</text>
