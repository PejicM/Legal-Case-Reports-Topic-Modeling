<tocase>Opitz v Repatriation Commission (1991) 29 FCR 50</tocase>
<text>22 The Tribunal had no obligation to detail to Mr Cook the shortcomings of his material. It was reasonable for the Tribunal to give him the opportunity of explaining and advancing his application at a phone directions hearing. In this respect, the case differs from Opitz v Repatriation Commission (1991) 29 FCR 50 where at 58 to 59, it was held that the applicant was denied an opportunity of putting further evidence to the Tribunal due to the unusual circumstance of his evidence by phone being interrupted by the advent of an earthquake.</text>
