<tocase>Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/226.html</AustLII>
<text>7 If the evidence were to establish unequivocally that Worimi has not been authorised by the native title claim group, the application may be summarily dismissed for failure to comply with s 61 of the [2004] FCAFC 226 ; Act ( Bodney v Bropho (2004) 140 FCR 77 at [52] per Stone J). However, the application should only be dismissed where the claim as expressed is untenable and on the basis of the evidence most favourable to Worimi ( Landers v State of South Australia (2003) 128 FCR 49 at [7]).

28 Ms Jowett also emphasises that the factual issues, many of which are complex in nature, should not be determined in interlocutory proceedings. The merits of the claim should be determined at trial ( Bodney at [11]). She points out, correctly, that there was no cross-examination of Worimi; nor has Mr Hillig adduced evidence from his mother Beryl Dates senior or from his sister Debbie Dates. Her explanation for the identification by Worimi of the different claim group in the first application is an assumption on his part that other Worimi people were recipients of the same knowledge as he held. The second application and the identification of the claim group was, according to Ms Jowett, prepared in the knowledge from the first application that some Worimi women and Mr Kelvin Dates, Worimi's brother, denied holding any native title rights over the Land.

29 Mr Jowett submits that, if individuals cease to acknowledge and observe relevant laws and customs, they will cease to possess native title. That provides an explanation why Worimi and his wife and children who continue to observe those laws and customs represent the totality of the claim group. That knowledge was passed to Worimi by his father, his father's brothers and his father's mother. She stresses that the determination of the recipients of the native title rights requires findings of fact to be made which ought not be the subject of inquiry for the purposes of a strike-out application.

30 Having made those submissions, Ms Jowett acknowledges that, if the second application does not comply with ss 61 and 62 of the Act, it is liable to be struck out.

48 Ms Jowett placed considerable reliance on Bodney , where the Full Court dealt with a claim group analogous to that of the present application and allowed an appeal against an order to strike out the application pursuant to s 84C of the Act.

49 Worimi has, unlike Mr Bodney, changed the composition of the claim group from the first to the second applications (cf Bodney at [5]) and has, in these proceedings, sought to explain his reasons for doing so. My consideration of the claim group and authorisation is based only on Worimi's evidence, as relied upon by him in these proceedings. That evidence includes his affidavit in these proceedings which refers to the first application and his affidavits in support of that application. Those affidavits were relied upon by Worimi in his written submissions. That evidence is untested by cross-examination. I have accepted that evidence. However, that does not preclude an analysis of that evidence to present a coherent understanding of the asserted claim group and the extent of authorisation.

50 Worimi's evidence is that there are other persons outside his immediate family who, as part of the Garuahgal people or the Worimi nation, would have been entitled to assert native title over the Land (cf Bodney at [28]). His qualification is that he now understands that they do not observe traditional laws and customs and that, accordingly, the persons specified in the claim group are the whole of the group alleged by him to hold the claimed native title rights and interests. In other words, as discussed in Bodney by Branson J at [31], Worimi relies upon the theoretical possibility that individuals who are Garuahgal or Worimi by descent do not share in all of the native title rights and interests because they have ceased to acknowledge the traditional laws and observe the traditional customs of the community. That is not a question that needs to be determined on this strike-out application. I am prepared to accept that possibility, for the purposes of this application.

51 The characteristics of those persons are members of the Garuahgal or Worimi people who presently observe traditional law and custom as described by Worimi or who may claim entitlement through marriage to the eldest son of the family. Worimi is the eldest son, as was his father. As Worimi's wife is included by her marriage to Worimi although there is no suggestion that she observes traditional law and custom, so also is his mother. As his daughters are part of the claim group as members of his family, to whom he has passed laws and customs, so too is his sister Debbie and possibly her children. The claim group of the second application is not comprised of all the persons who, according to traditional law and custom, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the native title claimed. It follows that it is liable to be struck out for failure to comply with s 61(1) of the Act.

52 It is necessary to consider whether Mr Hillig has established that the requirements of authorisation in s 251B(a) have not been met.</text>

<tocase>Colbung v Western Australia [2003] FCA 774</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/774.html</AustLII>
<text>43 Worimi's case seems to be that, if the persons otherwise possessing native title interests have abandoned them, they are no longer identifiable as members of a community living under the relevant laws and customs. Worimi does not claim that, according to traditional laws and customs, individual rights or family rights (in the sense of Worimi, his wife and daughters) are recognised by traditional law and custom. This is not a case where Worimi claims that his immediate family hold native title rights by virtue of the membership of their family alone (cf Colbung v Western Australia [2003] FCA 774). He acknowledges that the Land is Worimi land. That is, according to traditional law and custom, the rights are held by Worimi people or the particular clan or group, such as the Garuahgal people. Whatever the precise identity of the people who possess such rights over the Land (see Hillig (No 2) at [20]-[22]), it is a group larger than Worimi and his family. If that is the case the family, by calling itself a native title claim group, does not establish that it is a "native title claim group" for the purposes of Worimi's entitlement to make the second application pursuant to s 61(1) of the Act ( Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] ).</text>

<tocase>De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/110.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The reasoning can be said to be as follows. The native title rights are held by the Worimi people. The custodian and protector is the eldest son in a family, although this is not an exclusive right because, for example, women are custodians of the women's site; it is not suggested that Worimi's father's mother was the sole female custodian. There is no evidence of a basis in traditional law and custom as to the restricted class of persons who hold native title rights or individual rights or of the restriction to Worimi and his family. It is Worimi's own deduction that others whom he acknowledges would have such native title rights cannot have them because they fail to acknowledge that such rights exist over the Land. A claim group, however, may exist for the purposes of s 223(1) of the Act where only a part of the community have acknowledged and observed traditional laws and customs ( De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 at [58] ).

44 In De Rose (No 2) at [57] the Full Court said that a claimant group whose members have never acknowledged or observed traditional laws and customs cannot succeed in a claim for native title rights and interests merely because other Aboriginal peoples have acknowledged and observed the relevant traditional laws and customs, even if by those laws and customs observed by others, the claimant group "possessed" native title rights. The Court observed that the position would be similar where a native title claim is made by one or more individuals who do not assert a communal or group claim. Here, on the basis of Worimi's evidence, traditional law and custom identifies Worimi people other than Worimi and his family as "possessing" rights and interests in the Land, not least Worimi women. Worimi's evidence is that at least some of those persons have not been taught about the Land; they do not acknowledge and observe the relevant laws and customs. They do not, by the laws and customs described by Worimi, have a connection with the Land. That would preclude them from succeeding in a claim (s 223(1)(b); De Rose (No 2) at [56]).

45 Worimi concludes that those persons who denied native title did not know of the traditional laws and customs that established it. Worimi's assertion is that he and his family hold native title rights within the meaning of s 223(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. He does not suggest that, by traditional law and custom, native title rights were only "possessed" by his family (s 223(1)(a)) or that they "hold" exclusive to them the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed (s 61(1)).

46 De Rose (No 2) discussed the fact that a group that does not fulfil the requirements of s 223(1)(a) and (b) cannot succeed in a native title claim. This included a group that possessed the rights and interests under traditional laws and customs but did not, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land. The native title claimant group must establish rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by that community or group (at [58], original emphasis). Here, Worimi's evidence is that his claim group, himself, his wife and the daughters to whom he has passed the laws and custom, is not the totality of the group which possesses the rights and interests under traditional laws and customs. That group is the Worimi people, or Garuahgal people; the descendents of Mary Mahr. At the least it includes Worimi's mother Beryl Dates senior; his sister Debbie Dates and those of Debbie Dates' children to whom she has imparted knowledge of traditional laws and customs as specified in the first application.</text>

<text>6 Mr Hillig accepts that he bears a heavy onus in seeking to strike out the proceedings. He does not rely on s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). He submits that the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 is satisfied: the second application is so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed. He points out that, as expressed in General Steel , the test is met where the case disclosed is one which the Court is satisfied cannot succeed and where it is manifest that to allow the pleading to stand would involve useless expense (see also Lindon v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2) [1996] HCA 14 ; (1996) 136 ALR 251 at 255 6).</text>

<tocase>Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1115.html</AustLII>
<text>1 Mr Hillig is the Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council'). He seeks a declaration in separate proceedings ('the Hillig proceedings') that no native title exists over land at Port Stephens ('the Land'). The Land Council owns the fee simple in the Land, subject to any native title rights or interests (s 36(9) of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW)) and wishes to sell the Land. On 22 August 2006, I struck out a claimant application by Mr Dates, who prefers to be known as Worimi, for a determination that native title exists over the Land ('the first application'): Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115. Worimi has now filed a further claimant application ('the second application'). These proceedings concern the second application. Mr Hillig moves the Court for orders that the second application be struck out.

2 In order to deal with Mr Hillig's motion, it is necessary to reiterate some matters considered in Hillig (No 2). The first application was a claimant application by Worimi on behalf of women who asserted a native title interest in the Land as a sacred site for women. Worimi had sought, by a draft proposed application ('the proposed application'), to amend the first application to assert a native title interest held by himself and his family. The claim group of the second application is the same as the claim group identified in the proposed application considered in Hillig (No 2).

3 In Hillig (No 2) at [60] I discussed whether s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') requires the claim group to consist of the whole group of persons who hold native title over an area or whether it can comprise a sub-group which is only part of a larger group of native title holders. I concluded that, subject to an exception that is not relevant in this case, where a small family group or sub-group is only part of the group who claim to hold native title, the sub-group does not hold the common or group rights or interests within s 61.

4 I determined that the first application should be struck out (at [72]). I did not permit Worimi to amend that application for reasons that I gave. I did, however, give him the opportunity to file a further claimant application. A relevant consideration was the delayed hearing of the Hillig proceedings for a declaration of no native title over the Land ( Hillig (No 2) at [79]). I directed at [83] that any further application filed by Worimi include, in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the proper identification of and authorisation by the claim group; the connection between the claim group and the relevant traditional laws and customs observed; and the basis for the claim by that claim group from the time of sovereignty.

5 Worimi filed the second application on 19 September 2006 and in so doing initiated these proceedings. Without objection from Worimi, I made an order that Mr Hillig be joined. Mr Hillig now seeks to strike out the proceedings pursuant to s 84C of the Act or to dismiss them summarily pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</text>
