<text>91 As submitted by Westpac the language of the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee is unequivocal. The Applicants did not contend to the contrary. It is a guarantee that covers all moneys that Middleton Nominees " is or becomes liable to pay [Westpac] under another guarantee or indemnity ". Accordingly, the principle that " ambiguous contractual provisions should be construed in favour of the [guarantor]" does not arise: Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 , 561 and Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 , 433-437 [17] [23].</text>

<tocase>Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/55.html</AustLII>
<text>52 I accept that these authorities support the proposition that contemporaneously executed contracts forming part of the same transaction should, as a general rule, be read as a whole and construed by reference to each other: Star City Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1701 at [52] . However, it would go well beyond any concept of contractual context to alter the terms of one contemporaneously executed contract by reference to another where, as here: (1) the parties to each contract are not the same; (2) the term in the contract in question is not ambiguous; and (3) the term in the other contract is directly conflicting. This is especially so where the result is to require an essential term, such as the duration of the contract, to be amended from the written terms of one contract to obtain consistency between the two contracts. To do so would disrupt the longstanding rule that parties are bound by the unambiguous terms of their written agreement unless it is affected by fraud, mistake or misrepresentation: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 , 483-84 [33] and [35]. The terms of the Nepalle Guarantee, including its duration, are not ambiguous. In the absence of such ambiguity, the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it.

88 Westpac submitted that the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee secures all of Middleton Nominees' current liability to Westpac including any liability of Middleton Nominees as guarantor of the Advance debt. The Applicants disputed that the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee also secured the Advance debt on the ground that it could not be said that the Advance debt was of the same type or character as the original debt secured by the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee or that the Advance transaction documents refer back to the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee. In other words, the Applicants contended that it was not the intention of the parties for the Advance debt to be secured by the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee and the Kirszbaum Properties. For the following reasons, I reject that submission.
 
 Terms of the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee

89 The terms of the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee are important. First, there is no limit on the amount to be paid under it: cl 3. Secondly, cl 2 is headed "What is Covered by this Guarantee". It provides:
 
 
 This document relates to all money which [Middleton Nominees] may owe to [Westpac] now or in the future for any reason.
 
 This is the " Guaranteed Money ".
 ...
 
 At any time, the Guaranteed Money will also include the following.
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) money which [Middleton Nominees] contingently owes [Westpac] (money is "contingently" owed where the Customer has an obligation to pay [Westpac] if something happens or is discovered).
 
 ...
 
 (b) Money which [Middleton Nominees] may owe [Westpac] after that time of something happens or is discovered, even where there is no existing obligation to pay it, so long as it arises out of or in relation to circumstances existing, foreseeable or contemplated at the time.
 
 (c) Money which [Middleton Nominees] is or becomes liable to pay [Westpac] under another guarantee or indemnity.
 
 ...

90 Thirdly, Westpac was under no obligation to do anything in relation to, or to tell Mrs Kirszbaum anything concerning, Middelton Nominees' affairs, finances or transactions with Westpac. The responsibility rested with Mrs Kirszbaum both before and after the guarantee was signed: cl 12. Moreover, Mrs Kirszbaum was liable to pay all Guaranteed Money including under replacement or changed "Arrangements": cl 13. The term "Arrangement" was defined in cl 35 to mean:
 
 
 any document, agreement or dealing of any sort between [Westpac] and [Middleton Nominees] (whether or not with others) including where [Westpac] or [Middleton Nominees] becomes a party because of an assignment.

<tocase>Estoril Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1993) 6 BPR 13,146</tocase>
<text>92 However, the Applicants contend that despite the unequivocal words of the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee, the proper construction of the guarantee is not to be determined solely by reference to its express terms but by reference to what they describe as "general rules of construction" to be applied in determining the intention of the parties in respect of the "all moneys" or "dragnet clause". These general rules of construction were said to be found in the decision of Young J in Estoril Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1993) 6 BPR 13,146, 13,151. Those reasons for decision and the subsequent authorities do not support the Applicants' submission.

93 In fact, what Young J summarised were not rules of construction but " guidelines which illustrate how court often approach dragnet clauses provided that the language permits them to do so" : Estoril Investments , 6 BPR 13,146 at 13,151; see also Smith v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1996] NSW ConvR 55-774. Nine "guidelines" were set out. They are no more than guidelines. What Young J did was to take a number of the guidelines and analyse whether the guidelines represented the position in Australia. The conclusion his Honour reached is best illustrated by looking at the second guideline that " only debts of the same type or character as the original debt are secured by the mortgage" . After analysing the authorities in the United States, England, New Zealand and Australia, Young J concluded as follows:
 
 
 I also believe that it is fair to say that in many cases the Court will come to the view as stated in proposition (2) above. However, that is a very different thing from saying that there is some general rule that mortgages must be construed as if they were limited to debts of the same type as those for which the mortgage was originally taken out.</text>

<text>22 The Form of Acknowledgment attached to that document on which the critical handwritten annotation was made did not form part of the agreement of guarantee and indemnity between Westpac and Middleton Nominees. The Form of Acknowledgment referred to, but did not contain or constitute, an agreement between the parties. It was a document sought by Westpac as a record of statements made by Mrs Kirszbaum which Westpac could use if Mrs Kirszbaum were to later claim that she should not be held to be bound by the agreement because she did not understand it. As the High Court pointed out in Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29 ; (2002) 213 CLR 401. 418 [8] and Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 , 461-62 [22], it is the written terms of an agreement which speak to third parties. This is particularly so in commercial contexts where the agreement is recorded in a deed or other similar document. In the present case, it is the Guarantee and not the Form of Acknowledgment that records the terms of the bargain the parties made.</text>
