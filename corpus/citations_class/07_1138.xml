<tocase>Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1810.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The applicant justifies the raising of those issues for the first time on appeal on the basis of an asserted obligation of the Tribunal to inquire into and correctly consider questions of law arising on the matter before it, even in the face of concessions or admissions by the parties. It relies upon Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328 at [36] [39] for that proposition.

32 I do not consider that that decision supports its contention. That case relevantly concerned the question of whether the Tribunal had erred in failing to address the question under s 24(2)(c) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) of whether the employee claiming compensation had undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment which was compensable. That consideration was relevant to whether the injury had resulted in permanent impairment, so as to entitle the employee concerned to a lump sum compensation payment. The Full Court (Drummond, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) at [39] said:
 
 The Tribunal is not, as a general rule, required to ignore the fact that one or both parties have made admissions or concessions, express or implied, that particular issues which the original decision-maker may have had to consider need not be the subject of inquiry and determination by the Tribunal. The Tribunal will, however, fall into error of law by failing to inquire of its own motion into, and make a finding on, an issue the subject of an admission or concession by a party that is material to its decision if there is reason to doubt that the admission or concession is factually justified. But in the absence of there being some reason to question the admission or concession, the Tribunal will generally be entitled not to inquire into the issue for itself, but to act on that admission or concession in making its decision.

33 In my judgment, the conduct of the matter before the Tribunal clearly indicates that, at least impliedly, the applicant did not seek to ventilate the issues arising under ss 10(7) or 63 of the Act, and restricted itself to the matters which the Tribunal identified. The Tribunal in those circumstances was quite entitled to proceed upon the basis that those matters were not contentious. It did not err in failing to address them. Consequently, the applicant is not now entitled to assert or cannot succeed in asserting that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to do so.</text>

<text>34 In addition, there are a few matters in respect of which it is not at all clear that, had the issues been raised by the applicant for consideration, the evidence would have remained as it was before the Tribunal. As discussed in more detail below, in the course of considering the several matters raised by the applicant, the matters now raised under (1), (2) and (5) above and possibly in (3) above may have led to there being more evidence before the Tribunal pertaining to them. For example, there may have been evidence from Dr Macris as to the significance, if any, of the additional medical history to him issuing the CMF to the respondent. There may have been evidence from Dr Bauze and Dr Brooks, and perhaps other evidence, as to the relationship between the diseased condition of the respondent's right knee and the aggravation of the diseased condition of his left knee. There may have been further evidence from the applicant about his state of mind at the time he was examined by Dr Macris concerning his capacity to do the proposed work on the Iron Chieftain. There may have been other relevant communications between the applicant and the respondent, or between the applicant and others such as medical practitioners. That is not of course intended to be exhaustive, or necessarily correct. It is really speculative as to how the hearing before the Tribunal would have proceeded if those issues had been properly signalled. Such considerations, however, do indicate that it would not be appropriate now to permit those matters to be raised: see. eg. Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7-8; University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 59 ALJR 481 at 483. I shall nevertheless consider each of the matters sought to be raised by the applicant, even though in some instances the material available may not be the full material which would have been available had the applicant raised those issues before the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v Kazi [2004] 2 Qd R 458</tocase>
<text>45 The applicant submitted that Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v Kazi [2004] 2 Qd R 458 supported its contention. In that case it was held that a contract of employment was void, so the injured person was not a worker within the meaning of s 12(1) of the WorkCover Queensland Act 1996 (Qld) and could not claim compensation against his employer. The definition of "worker" in s 12(1) was "an individual who works under a contract of service". It was found that the contract of employment was void, so that the injured person was not working under a contract of service and so was not a worker. The contract was found to be void because the claimant in that case was an unlawful non-citizen in Australia. Section 235 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) made it an offence for an unlawful non-citizen in Australia to perform work in Australia in the circumstances then applicable. Hence, the Court found that the claimant in that case could not enter into a contract of service: see especially at [12] [13]. A similar result was reached in WorkCover Corporation (San Remo Macaroni Co Pty Ltd) v Da Ping (1994) 175 LSJS 469.</text>

<tocase>Yango Pastoral Co Pty Limited v First Chicago Australia Limited [1978] HCA 42 ; (1978) 139 CLR 410</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/42.html</AustLII>
<text>46 In Yango Pastoral Co Pty Limited v First Chicago Australia Limited [1978] HCA 42 ; (1978) 139 CLR 410 at 413, Gibbs ACJ said
 
 Where a statute imposes a penalty upon the making or performance of a contract, it is a question of construction whether the statute intends to prohibit the contract in this sense, that is, to render it void and unenforceable, or whether it intends only that the penalty for which it provides shall be inflicted if the contract is made or performed.
 
 

At 426, Mason J said
 
 ... the question is whether the statute intends merely to penalize the person who contrives the prohibition or whether it intends to go further and prohibit contracts the making of which constitute [the breach]. In deciding this question the court will take into account the scope and purpose of the statute and the consequences of the suggested implication with a view to ascertaining whether it would conduce to, or frustrate, the object of the statute.</text>

<tocase>Visscher v Munro [2005] FCAFC 252 ; (2005) 147 FCR 538</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/252.html</AustLII>
<text>47 One of the principal purposes of the Navigation Act is to ensure the safety of ships and crew in Australian waters: see Visscher v Munro [2005] FCAFC 252 ; (2005) 147 FCR 538 at 542. The Marine Orders, as I have said, may also be interpreted in that context. However, I do not think that it follows that a contract of employment procured by a person with a CMF which has been issued despite (or because of) misleading or incomplete information provided to the doctor concerned necessarily would frustrate that objective. The Marine Orders, and in particular the CMF, aims to ensure that the crew on a ship are physically fit for the duties which they are to undertake so that they are not a danger to themselves or to others or to the ship. Dr Macris undertook his own examination of the respondent. As a result of that examination, he observed that the respondent had normal use of the arms and legs, normal gait, and did not have any apparent defect of the bones or joints, enjoyed movements of the joints in the normal range and without pain, and did not have any restriction or pain in the movement of the spine.

48 It would follow from the applicant's contention that a misleading or inaccurate or incomplete disclosure on a medical information form, even one irrelevant to the particular person's fitness to undertake work proposed to be undertaken on a ship, would lead to the invalidity of the CMF. For example, through oversight, an applicant for a CMF may simply not disclose a previous medical condition (such as an appendix removed), and be visited with the consequence that the CMF itself is invalid, and (as the applicant contends) that there is therefore no valid employment subsequently undertaken on the basis of the CMF which has been issued. I do not think such a construction is necessary to fulfil the object of the Marine Orders as part of the service of the purposes of the Navigation Act . Nor does that construction provide the certainty which the CMF is intended to provide, as a foundation for employment; it would be ... a provisional foundation vulnerable to identifying at some later time and perhaps at a much later time that all along the employment has been invalid. Such an outcome does not lie easily with the definitions in the marine Orders to which I have referred.

49 In my view, the second step is equally problematical for the applicant. In addition, there is nothing in the Seafarers Act itself to support the contention for the reasons just discussed. An employee is defined in s 4 to include a seafarer, and a seafarer is defined in s 3 to include a person employed in any capacity on a prescribed ship. As a matter of fact, the respondent was employed on the Iron Chieftain operated by the applicant. On the clear wording of s 26 of the Seafarers Act, if the respondent as an employee suffered an injury which resulted in his incapacity for work, compensation was payable to him for that injury under the Seafarers Act. It would be a wholly disproportionate consequence of the applicant's contention that he would be ineligible for compensation, even if the non-disclosure or incomplete disclosure of his medical condition was accidental or through oversight, or if it related to a condition which had no relevance to his capacity to perform his duties. It is difficult to accept that outcome would have been intended in legislation which has a significant social objective. The analysis of the relative significance of the information which has been either not disclosed or inaccurately reported regarding the past medical history, and its relationship to the injury, or of the reasons for its non-disclosure or inaccurate disclosure, is not one upon which, in my view, the entitlement to compensation under the Seafarers Act are predicated. That may be one of the situations which, subject to considering the applicant's further contentions, ss 26(3) or 10(7) of the Seafarers Act is designed to cover. The disproportionality to which I have referred is a relevant consideration to the construction for which the applicant contends: cf Nonferral (NSW) Pty Ltd v Taufia (1998) 43 NSWLR 312 at 316. Indeed, the point was made in Visscher 147 FCR at 542 that a medical certificate is not conclusive of the question of fitness to undertake particular duties. In that case, the Full Court at 542 adopted a submission of counsel that:
 
 ... the regulatory scheme that is established by the [Navigation] Act and the Orders is a licensing system of a familiar generic sort, of which the issuing of medical certificates is part. It does not, either expressly or impliedly, deal with the contractual relationship between employers and employees.</text>

<tocase>Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84</tocase>
<text>54 In my judgment, ss 63(2)(a) and (b) are not intended to so restrict a claimant for compensation under the Seafarers Act. At the time a claim for compensation is made, it will often be the case that the precise nature of the injury or its aetiology (as ultimately found) will not be apparent either to the claimant or to his medical advisers: see e.g. Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84 at 91. I consider that the nature of the injury as expressed in the claim was sufficient to put the applicant on notice as to the general nature of the injury or injuries which the respondent claimed to have suffered, so that the applicant could exercise its right to require a medical examination under s 66 of the Seafarers Act and to seek information about and from the respondent under s 67 of the Seafarers Act. It is not suggested in the submissions that the notification contained in the claim in any way impeded the applicant from undertaking those inquiries. In addition, as the course of hearing before the Tribunal illustrates, there was medical evidence adduced from both Dr Brook and Dr Bauze that the applicant had suffered an aggravation of his left knee disease unrelated to, or only marginally related to the medial meniscal condition in his left knee. The applicant permitted the proceeding to be conducted on that basis, including testing the medical evidence. It did not object to that evidence as being irrelevant to the claim, nor indeed could it sensibly have done so.

55 It is convenient to address these two contentions of the applicant together.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth v Beattie (1981) 53 FLR 191</tocase>
<text>58 It is clear that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the respondent had a pre-existing degenerative condition of his left knee which constituted a "disease", and that his injury arose because that pre-existing degenerative condition had been aggravated. The Tribunal addressed the issue of causation incorporated into the definition of "disease" by finding expressly that the aggravation had been materially contributed to by the particular employment activities undertaken by the respondent. It also found expressly that that aggravation had caused incapacity for work. Those findings, in my judgment, were reasonably open to the Tribunal. It accepted the respondent's evidence that, prior to his commencement of employment on the Iron Chieftain, he did not have ongoing symptoms of pain in his left knee, and that after performing his duties for some time, he developed quite significant symptoms in his left knee which he found to be disabling. Pain brought on by work activity may constitute an aggravation of a pre-existing injury, even though no pathological change takes place: see Commonwealth v Beattie (1981) 53 FLR 191 at 197; Federal Broom Company Pty Limited v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626.</text>

<tocase>Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124</tocase>
<text>69 The applicant acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer, and had not previously suffered from, a degenerative condition in his left knee. That is the disease specifically which the Tribunal found had been aggravated by the respondent's employment with the applicant. The respondent's evidence was that he had previously had trouble with his left knee in 2002 when he had been learning to drive a truck with a heavy clutch, but that the problem had resolved following physiotherapy. It was not contended by the applicant that that circumstance was sufficient to have obliged the respondent by reason of s 10(7) to have disclosed specifically the previously degenerative condition of his left knee because it is now shown that he was aware of it. It is not a circumstance where the respondent failed to disclose a symptom of a disease in the left knee in circumstances where it ought to have been disclosed, as distinct from the suffering of a particular and temporary injury: cf Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124.

70 The medical evidence indicated that the respondent had an underlying degenerative condition of both his knees, but does not firmly indicate that those degenerative conditions were related, or that the incapacity caused by aggravation of the degenerative condition in the left knee was related to the degenerative condition in the right knee. Reference need only be made to the report of Dr Bauze of 12 September 2005 and of the respondent's general practitioner, Dr Chambers, in his report of 19 October 2005 discussed in the Tribunal's reasons.

71 The applicant submitted that "the relationship between degenerative conditions in knees is hardly controversial". That may or may not be correct as a matter of general medical science, but it does not address the particular findings of fact, or the particular evidence in this case. As its contentions indicate, there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondent's right knee and his left knee. The issue was not fully explored because, in the particular circumstances, it was not a matter upon which the Tribunal was required to make, or made, a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant. It merely found that the respondent had a degenerative condition of his left knee which had been aggravated by his employment with the applicant, leading to incapacity for work. That state of the evidence does not enable me to make any finding on the issue, as potentially authorised by s 44(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).

72 In those circumstances, in my judgment, the applicant has not shown in any event that the respondent made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer, or had not previously suffered, from a degenerative condition in his left knee or had not suffered and did not suffer from the aggravation of that condition when he applied for his CMF or subsequently. In this particular case, the Tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicant's contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicant's right and left knees were a single ailment, and should therefore be treated as a single disease. It made a different finding. The finding was open to it.

73 Consequently, the condition upon which s 10(7) would operate as a matter of fact to disentitle the applicant from compensation under the Seafarers Act has not been shown by the applicant to have been made out, and indeed its premise is inconsistent with the finding which the Tribunal in fact made.</text>

<tocase>Johnson v Marshall Sons &amp; Co Ltd [1906] AC 409</tocase>
<text>75 The Tribunal adopted the view that it was necessary to consider the facts of the particular case to determine whether the conduct in question amounted to serious and wilful misconduct. That is consistent with the approach with the courts have taken to such expressions in the Seafarers Act and in its ancestors and analogues, including under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897 (UK). See, e.g. Johnson v Marshall Sons &amp; Co Ltd [1906] AC 409. Such an approach has been taken in Australian cases dealing with that expression: see Ismakovich v Broken Hill Pty Company Limited (1982) 49(2) SAIR 209; Comcare v Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards v Faulls Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 129; Hills v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1987) 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785. That does not suggest, as the applicant contends, that the concept of "serious and wilful misconduct" is ambulatory. It simply indicates that the assessment of whether, in particular circumstances, serious and wilful misconduct has been established, is a question of fact to be decided in all the circumstances of the particular case. In my judgment, the Tribunal did not err in law in approaching the matter in that way.

81 Misconduct is serious if it significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury: see Johnson [1906] AC 409; Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards [1971] WAR 129. In Hills 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785, Green CJ said:
 
 
 For conduct to amount to serious and wilful misconduct it must be such as to give rise to an immediate risk of serious injury, it must be deliberate and not merely a thoughtless act done on the spur of the moment and it must be accompanied by an appreciation of the risk which is involved in it.</text>

79 A similar statutory scheme and factual circumstances to those now under consideration were considered by Judge Stanley in Ismakovich 49(2) SAIR 209. His Honour said at 236, after considering the equivalent of s 10(7) in the Workers Compensation Act 1971 (SA) that:
 
 The legislature has therein specifically provided that, if after being warned of the consequences of his action, the worker wilfully and falsely represents himself in writing as not having previously suffered from an injury which is a disease and he subsequently suffers such injury arising out of or in the course of his employment with that employer, compensation shall not be payable in respect of that injury.
 
 It seems to me implicit from the inclusion of that provision in that section that the legislature did not regard the wilful making by a worker of a false statement concerning any prior injury as amounting to "serious and wilful misconduct": within the meaning of section 9(5), for, if such a statement was already embraced by that term, there was no necessity to enact that portion of the provision of section 90(1).
 
 

The same can be said for s 26(3) and s 10(7) of the Seafarers Act. However, I do not need to decide that question.

80 Even assuming that a wilful and false misrepresentation made in seeking employment could be brought within the serious and wilful misconduct exclusion of s 26(3), it is necessary for the applicant to have shown in the particular circumstances that there was in fact serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the respondent and that the misconduct caused the injury.</text>

<text>75 The Tribunal adopted the view that it was necessary to consider the facts of the particular case to determine whether the conduct in question amounted to serious and wilful misconduct. That is consistent with the approach with the courts have taken to such expressions in the Seafarers Act and in its ancestors and analogues, including under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897 (UK). See, e.g. Johnson v Marshall Sons &amp; Co Ltd [1906] AC 409. Such an approach has been taken in Australian cases dealing with that expression: see Ismakovich v Broken Hill Pty Company Limited (1982) 49(2) SAIR 209; Comcare v Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards v Faulls Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 129; Hills v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1987) 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785. That does not suggest, as the applicant contends, that the concept of "serious and wilful misconduct" is ambulatory. It simply indicates that the assessment of whether, in particular circumstances, serious and wilful misconduct has been established, is a question of fact to be decided in all the circumstances of the particular case. In my judgment, the Tribunal did not err in law in approaching the matter in that way.

81 Misconduct is serious if it significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury: see Johnson [1906] AC 409; Calipari [2001] FCA 1534 ; Richards [1971] WAR 129. In Hills 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-785, Green CJ said:
 
 
 For conduct to amount to serious and wilful misconduct it must be such as to give rise to an immediate risk of serious injury, it must be deliberate and not merely a thoughtless act done on the spur of the moment and it must be accompanied by an appreciation of the risk which is involved in it.</text>
