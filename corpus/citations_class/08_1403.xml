<text>39 It is not considered that the present proceeding exposes any sufficient reason to depart from the " general policy " set forth in s 39 of the 1976 Act. The only legislative limitation on the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 40 is one directing attention to whether " the ends of justice appear to render it expedient to do so ": Insurance Commissioner v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (1982) 65 FLR 172 at 181. Relevant to the exercise of the discretion is a recognition of the important role that juries have long played in English and Australian law and the circumstances in which juries have traditionally been employed. Although the scarcity of the population was a reason why in colonial New South Wales the number of jurors was confined to 4 and not 12 persons (see: Henchman P, ' The New South Wales Jury of Four Persons ' (1959) 33 ALJ 235), the importance of juries in the administration of justice was acknowledged from the outset: Caledonian Collieries Ltd v Fenwick (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 482 at 488 92 per Else-Mitchell J.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1255.html</AustLII>
<text>53 The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded:
 Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: "(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action." [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. 
Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it " undermines or perverts " the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some " unwritten law " such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Rigg [2001] FCA 590</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/590.html</AustLII>
<text>27 This Court unquestionably has a discretionary power to direct that a trial be by jury. The relevant source of that power is said by the Applicant to be ss 30(3) and 31 of the Bankruptcy Act . Those sections relevantly provide as follows:
 30 General powers of Courts in bankruptcy ... (3) If in a proceeding before the Federal Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have tried before a jury, the Federal Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial of that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trial of an issue of fact in an action. ... 31 Exercise of jurisdiction (1) In exercising jurisdiction under this Act, the Court shall hear and determine the following matters in open Court: ... (i) applications for the trial of questions of fact with a jury and the trial of those questions; ... (2) All other matters under this Act may, in the discretion of the Court, be heard in open Court or in Chambers. 
 Section 30(3) is a provision which " specifically provides for a discretion to order trial by jury in a bankruptcy matter " : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Rigg [2001] FCA 590 at [8] per Beaumont J.

28 Also to be noted, however, are ss 39 and 40 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , which provide as follows:
 39 Trial without jury In every suit in the Court, unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders, the trial shall be by a Judge without a jury. 40 Power of Court to direct trial of issues with a jury The Court or a Judge may, in any suit in which the ends of justice appear to render it expedient to do so, direct the trial with a jury of the suit or of an issue of fact, and may for that purpose make all such orders, issue all such writs and cause all such proceedings to be had and taken as the Court or Judge thinks necessary, and upon the finding of the jury the Court may give such decision and pronounce such judgment as the case requires.

29 It was understood that Counsel for the Applicant quite properly did not contend that the Applicant had any entitlement to a trial by jury -- whichever Act was invoked. It was understood that Counsel for the Applicant accepted that the question as to whether or not there should be a trial with a jury was ultimately a matter -- not of entitlement -- but a matter for the discretion of this Court.

54 Moreover, and although there may be trial by jury in bankruptcy proceedings, it is the exception rather than the rule: Re Shields; Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 51 FCR 308. Einfeld J there observed (at 309):
 ... in bankruptcy proceedings jury trials will be the exception rather than the rule. ... A jury trial involves a great deal of expense and time both to the parties and the Court, as well as considerable inconvenience to the members of the community who constitute the jury. The use of juries in civil matters has steadily declined during this century and is now largely reserved for those areas where serious imputations are to be made against the character of a party. Like divorce, bankruptcy is no longer regarded as such a matter. In the absence of some very compelling special circumstance, the intention of Parliament is clearly that bankruptcy proceedings be heard by a judge.

Section 30(3) only applies where " a question of fact arises ". See: Ray v Perrett [2007] FCA 1672.

<text>38 Sections 39 and 40 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , it may further be noted, are in substantially the same form as ss 12 and 13 of the High Court Procedure Act 1903 (Cth). Those latter provisions were considered by Fullagar J in McDermott v Collien [1953] HCA 44 ; (1953) 87 CLR 154. His Honour there formulated the " general policy " as follows (at 157):
 Two things ... seem clear enough. The first is that with the merits and demerits of trial by jury as a means of determining civil causes I have nothing whatever to do. ... [S]o far as any question of general policy is involved, it is settled for me by the High Court Procedure Act. Trial without a jury is the normal mode of trial of actions in this Court, and some special reason must be shown for a departure in any particular case from that normal mode. The second thing that seems clear is that it is not enough to show that the cause of action is of a kind which could quite properly be tried with a jury and which was normally tried with a jury in England before the Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. 66). The decisions of Hodges J. and of Isaacs J. perhaps suggest that the nature of the cause of action is not even a relevant consideration. I would not be prepared to assent to that as a general proposition: indeed I would rather have thought that it might in some cases be a potent consideration. But it is clear that it is not enough to say: "This is a kind of action which is quite suitable for trial with a jury, and I would like to have it tried with a jury."

<text>43 Albeit in a different context, applications made pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) may allege in an appropriate case that statutory powers have been exercised for an " improper purpose ". Indeed, the 1977 Act expressly contemplates that a ground upon which an administrative decision may be sought to be impugned is " bad faith ": s 5(2)(d). It may be considered that an allegation of " bad faith " is a more serious allegation than one of pursuing an " improper purpose ". Both are serious allegations. But such applications have long been heard and determined by Judges of this Court without a jury. Although it must readily be recognised that an allegation of " bad faith " is a " very serious allegation " to make, it is an allegation that has in fact been made in other proceedings against both a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (eg, Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 at [32] , [2007] FCA 394 ; 66 ATR 225) and against others exercising statutory power (eg, SCAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397 at [19] ; SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 361 , 194 ALR 749). " Fraud " or " equitable fraud " is likewise a very serious allegation. Public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court, it is considered, has only been enhanced by this Court entertaining and resolving such " serious " allegations. Such allegations have been made in the past and presumably will continue to be made. And when made they will be resolved. It may be that a case will arise where a Judge of this Court orders a jury. But this proceeding is not that case.</text>

<text>49 Section 30(3) employs the language of this Court being empowered to " direct the trial " of a question of fact " if it thinks fit ". The sub-section confers a " wide discretion ": Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 at [29] , [1999] FCA 385 ; 88 FCR 445 at 450. This language, it was submitted in oral submissions, places a " gloss " upon the language employed in s 40 of the 1976 Act. Section 30(3), it was submitted, is the more specific test to be applied by this Court when considering an application for trial by jury in bankruptcy proceedings.

50 Whether or not s 30(3) does in fact place any such " gloss " upon the statutory test as formulated in s 40 may also be left to one side. Even if attention is confined to the language of ss 30 and/or 31 of the 1966 Act, it is not considered that any different conclusion should be reached in respect to the Applicant's Motion . Sections 30(3) and 31, it is again considered, support a conclusion contrary to that now advanced on behalf of the Applicant.

51 Neither section confers any entitlement to a trial by jury; indeed, it was understood that Counsel for the Applicant again properly accepted that conclusion.

53 The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded:

<text>37 The normal method or mode of trial in this Court is by judge alone: Insurance Commissioner v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (1982) 65 FLR 172 at 182. " Substantial reason ", it has been said, must be shown for a departure from the usual mode of trial: Gargan v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2004] FCA 641 at [6] per Hely J.

39 It is not considered that the present proceeding exposes any sufficient reason to depart from the " general policy " set forth in s 39 of the 1976 Act. The only legislative limitation on the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 40 is one directing attention to whether " the ends of justice appear to render it expedient to do so ": Insurance Commissioner v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (1982) 65 FLR 172 at 181. Relevant to the exercise of the discretion is a recognition of the important role that juries have long played in English and Australian law and the circumstances in which juries have traditionally been employed.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/56.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The difficulty, however, which would have inevitably confronted the Applicant -- even had it not been abandoned -- is the simple fact that s 80 is confined to a " trial on indictment ". It is Parliament, and not this Court or the High Court, which determines whether proceedings are to be commenced by way of indictment. It is not for this Court to determine that proceedings are sufficiently " serious " that they should be commenced by indictment: Li Chia Hsing v Rankin [1978] HCA 56 ; (1978) 141 CLR 182 at 189 90. Barwick CJ there concluded: 
 Further, if in truth from s 80 you could derive the conclusion that, constitutionally, all "serious" offences must be tried on indictment by a jury, it would be for the Court and not for the Parliament to determine whether any given offence was relevantly a "serious" offence. The limited submission of the applicant that, for the reasons given on his behalf, the present offence was a "serious" offence, in my opinion, fails. ... Further, to so reduce the universality of the language of the section would be insufficient to create a constitutional guarantee that those offences must be treated as indictable offences. The applicant's submission in reality is that s 80 postulates that some offences are of their nature, or of their nature and circumstances, "indictable" offences, ie offences which may not be prosecuted except on indictment. The applicant describes these offences as "serious" offences. Section 80 , however, only operates on indictment. Its language was chosen in the knowledge of Art 3 of the Constitution of the United States and of the experience of that country with the construction and operation of that article over the considerable period of time which had elapsed before the terms of s 80 were accepted. ... [I]t is, in my opinion, not possible to conclude, apart of course from the expressed intention of the Parliament in the relevant statute, that an offence is of its nature "indictable". Summary prosecution for a wide variety of offences has a long history, though punishment upon summary conviction is generally limited so far as imprisonment is provided to a term of twelve months or less. It was unanimously decided in R v Archdall and Roskruge; Ex parte Carrigan and Brown [1928] HCA 18 ; [(1928) 41 CLR 128] that the section placed no impediment in the way of the Parliament providing for the summary prosecution of an offence.</text>

Indeed, the 1977 Act expressly contemplates that a ground upon which an administrative decision may be sought to be impugned is " bad faith ": s 5(2)(d). It may be considered that an allegation of " bad faith " is a more serious allegation than one of pursuing an " improper purpose ". Both are serious allegations. But such applications have long been heard and determined by Judges of this Court without a jury.

" Fraud " or " equitable fraud " is likewise a very serious allegation. Public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court, it is considered, has only been enhanced by this Court entertaining and resolving such " serious " allegations.

<tocase>Taylor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 195 , 99 ATC 4268</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/195.html</AustLII>
<text>46 Each application for a trial by jury must necessarily depend on the facts upon which such an order is sought and the individual judgment of the legal practitioners making the application. Subject to that qualification, the decision of the Full Court in Taylor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 195 , 99 ATC 4268 provides some limited assistance. The Deputy Commissioner had there obtained judgment, a bankruptcy notice and a sequestration order. The trial judge had declined to appoint a jury. As in the present case, Constitutional rights were there also sought to be invoked; unlike the present case, the scope for disputed facts was apparently more confined. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ there concluded:
 [40] The appellants advance an additional argument on the appeal as to their entitlement to have a jury trial on the hearing of the petitions. They submit that the power to make a sequestration order is a power to acquire property of a person which falls within s51(xxxi) of the Constitution . The constitutional guarantee that the power may only be exercised upon the provision of just terms to the person from whom the property is acquired gives rise, they submit, to the jury issue of whether the taking of their property is upon just terms. The submission misunderstands the administration of the property of a bankrupt for the benefit of the bankrupt's creditors. There is no acquisition of property within the operation of s51(xxxi) of the Constitution when the property of a bankrupt is sequestrated and vested in a trustee in bankruptcy. S51(xxxi) has no bearing on the matter: Re Dohnert Muller Schmidt and Co; Attorney-General of the Commonwealth v Schmidt [1961] HCA 21 ; (1961) 105 CLR 361 at 372. [41] The appellants' submission as to the right to trial by jury on a trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth (s80 of the Constitution ) and to the requirements of full faith and credit being given to the laws of every State (s118 of the Constitution ) do not advance their case to a right to a trial by jury on the hearing of the bankruptcy petitions. [42] In these circumstances there were no issues of fact in dispute on the hearing of the bankruptcy petitions or on the hearing of the review of the District Registrar's decisions, which were capable of, or appropriate for, resolution by the verdict of a jury. ... 
As in the present case, it is not considered that any such questions of fact which may require resolution are appropriate for resolution by the verdict of a jury.

47 A submission that public confidence in this Court would be affected if a jury were not appointed in this case is, with respect, without substance.

48 The manner in which provisions such as ss 39 and 40 of the Federal Court of Australia Act have been interpreted and applied was, presumably, the reason why the Applicant placed greater -- if not exclusive -- reliance upon ss 30(3) and 31 of the Bankruptcy Act .</text>

<tocase>Thurecht v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 3 FCR 570 ; 84 ATC 4480 ; 15 ATR 822</tocase>
<text>44 Proceedings against a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation are not relevantly different for present purposes to proceedings against other Commonwealth office holders or decision-makers. But Deputy Commissioners have attracted in the past allegations of serious wrongdoing. Thus, for example, in Thurecht v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 3 FCR 570 ; 84 ATC 4480 ; 15 ATR 822 there was an allegation that a statutory power had been exercised in " bad faith " by reason of the Deputy Commissioner seeking to make an example of the applicants. Sheppard J referred to the evidence and summarised the allegations as follows (at 587):
 ... it is capable of suggesting that there had in fact been decided upon at a high level in Canberra, a policy designed to disadvantage -- really to punish -- those who had had the temerity to force the Commissioner's hand by making applications for writs of mandamus. That policy was designed to ensure that anybody else minded to make such an application would be discouraged from doing so. That is the applicants' case. The question is whether I should accept it. 
The allegation was rejected. There was no suggestion, however, in that case that public confidence in this Court would have been enhanced if those facts relevant to the resolution of such an allegation had been resolved by a jury.

45 The conferral by the Commonwealth legislature of such jurisdiction as that conferred by the 1976 Act upon this Court is only consistent with a legislative recognition that this Court will impartially and independently determine each case which comes before it, including litigation in which the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities may be respondents. No submission was advanced, nor could it be advanced, that there is any lack of public confidence in the manner in which this Court resolves contentious disputes involving allegations of misconduct or the pursuit of improper purposes by the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities; nor is it considered that public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court would be enhanced if such applications were to be heard by Judge and jury.</text>

26 Consistent with the abandonment of reliance upon s 80 of the Constitution as the source of any entitlement to have this Court hear the Application before it by Judge and jury, the relief as sought in the Notice of Motion as filed on 8 September 2008 sought to place reliance upon ss 30 and 31 of the Bankruptcy Act . Reference was also made to ss 39 and 40 of the Federal Court of Australia Act -- but those provisions, it was contended by the Applicant, were " qualified or not determinative of jury usage to decide factual questions in bankruptcy cases ".</text>
