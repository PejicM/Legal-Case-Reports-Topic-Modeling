<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>Ms Devers's submissions relied on Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 to suggest that her evidence should be accepted uncritically on several issues. Many of the issues which her counsel referred to were ones on which Focus called evidence from its witnesses. As counsel for Focus observed, the principle in Jones v Dunkel will not assist in the creation of evidence, merely the drawing of inferences where this is supported by Ms Devers's evidence. The evidence before the Court on the relevant issues raised by Ms Devers's application does not lead to the application of Jones v Dunkel , as there is nothing to suggest that Focus failed to called evidence on any matters of material significance from witnesses it would have been expected to call.

The Act renders unlawful conduct which constitutes discrimination on the ground of disability in the context of employment. At all material times, s 15 of the Act relevantly provided: 
 
 (1) It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against a person on the ground of the other person's disability or a disability of any of that other person's associates: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) in the arrangements made for the purpose of determining who should be offered employment; or
 (b) in determining who should be offered employment; or
 (c) in the terms or conditions on which employment is offered. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) It is unlawful for an employer or a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability or a disability of any of that employee's associates: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) in the terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords the employee; or
 (b) by denying the employee access, or limiting the employee's access, to opportunities for promotion, transfer or training, or to any other benefits associated with employment; or
 (c) by dismissing the employee; or
 (d) by subjecting the employee to any other detriment.

For the discrimination alleged to have been unlawful, it must have occurred "on the ground" of Ms Devers's disability. The discrimination may have been either direct or indirect discrimination as defined in the Act.</text>

<tocase>Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/49.html</AustLII>
<text>Whether a "requirement or condition" has been imposed on a person is a question of fact; see Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349 at 394 per Dawson and Toohey JJ, 408 per McHugh J and see also Catholic Education Office v Clarke (2004) 138 FCR 121 at [102] per Sackville and Stone JJ. The phrase "requirement or condition" in s 6 of the Act is to be construed broadly to include any form of qualification or prerequisite, although the actual requirement or condition itself should be formulated with some precision; see Clarke at [103] and Australian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic [1989] HCA 56 ; (1989) 168 CLR 165 at 185 per Dawson J.

An alleged discriminator may be found to have insisted on compliance with a requirement or condition within the meaning of s 6 of the Act even though the requirement or condition is not explicitly imposed. It is sufficient that the requirement or condition is implicit in the conduct that is said to constitute indirect discrimination; see Waters at 360 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J, 392 per Dawson and Toohey JJ and 407 per McHugh J. For example, the Court in Waters considered that it was open to the trial judge to find that the removal of conductors from trams amounted to a requirement or condition that disabled people could fully avail themselves of the services only if they could use trams without the assistance of conductors; at 361 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J.</text>

<text>Whether a "requirement or condition" has been imposed on a person is a question of fact; see Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349 at 394 per Dawson and Toohey JJ, 408 per McHugh J and see also Catholic Education Office v Clarke (2004) 138 FCR 121 at [102] per Sackville and Stone JJ. The phrase "requirement or condition" in s 6 of the Act is to be construed broadly to include any form of qualification or prerequisite, although the actual requirement or condition itself should be formulated with some precision; see Clarke at [103] and Australian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited v Banovic [1989] HCA 56 ; (1989) 168 CLR 165 at 185 per Dawson J.

Several cases have characterised the requirement to participate and receive classroom instruction without Auslan interpreters as a "requirement or condition" within the meaning of s 6 of the Act; see eg, Clarke and Hurst v Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562. In Clarke both the trial judge and Full Court found that not providing Auslan interpreters to a student with a hearing disability imposed a condition on him with which he could not comply; at [11] per Tamberlin J, [126] per Sackville and Stone JJ. Similarly, the Court in Hurst held that a student would be "denied the opportunity to achieve her full potential" if she were required to undertake her education without the assistance of Auslan interpreters; at [130] per Ryan, Finn and Weinberg JJ.

Focus submits that cases such as Clarke and Hurst must be treated with caution as they are education, rather than employment, cases. Ms Devers contends that these principles apply to both educational situations and her ability to participate in staff meetings and professional development. In particular, she argues that it was not sufficient for her to simply "cope" by attending some of the required training sessions and staff meetings and access the information through written English. Ms Devers alleges that she was denied meaningful access to her employment as she could not comply with the requirements imposed. Moreover, counsel for Ms Devers argues that Focus's submission that she accessed her employment as she attended work and received her wages over a number of years ignores the conditions of her employment which caused her detriment.</text>

The next step in determining whether indirect discrimination has occurred within the meaning of s 6 of the Act is to identify "an appropriate base group" with which to compare the individual alleging indirect discrimination in order to assess whether a substantially higher proportion of the individuals in the base group are able to comply with the requirement or condition; see Banovic at 178 9 per Deane and Gaudron JJ, 187 per Dawson J.

<tocase>Hurst v Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/100.html</AustLII>
<text>Several cases have characterised the requirement to participate and receive classroom instruction without Auslan interpreters as a "requirement or condition" within the meaning of s 6 of the Act; see eg, Clarke and Hurst v Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562. In Clarke both the trial judge and Full Court found that not providing Auslan interpreters to a student with a hearing disability imposed a condition on him with which he could not comply; at [11] per Tamberlin J, [126] per Sackville and Stone JJ. Similarly, the Court in Hurst held that a student would be "denied the opportunity to achieve her full potential" if she were required to undertake her education without the assistance of Auslan interpreters; at [130] per Ryan, Finn and Weinberg JJ.

Focus submits that cases such as Clarke and Hurst must be treated with caution as they are education, rather than employment, cases. Ms Devers contends that these principles apply to both educational situations and her ability to participate in staff meetings and professional development. In particular, she argues that it was not sufficient for her to simply "cope" by attending some of the required training sessions and staff meetings and access the information through written English. Ms Devers alleges that she was denied meaningful access to her employment as she could not comply with the requirements imposed. Moreover, counsel for Ms Devers argues that Focus's submission that she accessed her employment as she attended work and received her wages over a number of years ignores the conditions of her employment which caused her detriment.

The third step in the analysis is to determine whether Ms Devers was able to comply with the requirement or condition. The Full Court in Hurst at [134] stated if: 
 
 a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with a requirement or condition of the relevant kind, irrespective of whether that person can "cope" with the requirement or condition 
 

the "not able to comply" element of s 6(c) of the Act will be satisfied.
 Reasonableness

To succeed in her claim, Ms Devers also must show that the imposition of the requirement or condition was not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. In the absence of evidence to establish that the requirement or condition was unreasonable, the conduct engaged in by Focus will not be discriminatory. As with the other aspects of her claim, the onus is on Ms Devers to prove that the requirement or condition imposed was not reasonable in all the circumstances. ANALYSIS OF INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS 
 Request for a TTY

A major issue in contest in the proceeding is whether Ms Devers required Focus to provide her with a TTY before it ultimately provided her with one in July 2008.

Ms Devers was able to perform most aspects of her employment without the installation of flashing lights. She was unable to answer the door without the aid of flashing lights. Ms Devers was able to "cope" with the condition as another staff member was required to be in the CRU at all times. Nevertheless, the relevant test is whether Ms Devers was able to comply with the requirement; see Hurst at [134].

The Court in Hurst noted that an inability to comply may shown if "a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with the requirement or condition"; at [134]. Ms Devers has not shown that she suffered any serious disadvantage from her inability to answer the door. There is evidence to suggest that in 2004 her inability to hear whether someone was at the door was a source of grievances among other staff members. However, there is no evidence to indicate that this was a live issue in 2006 when the request for flashing lights was made. By this time, Focus had also purchased a pager which provided staff members with a means of attracting Ms Devers's attention. Her work consisted of caring for the clients at the Bungower Road CRU and she has not shown that her inability to answer the door led to any serious disadvantage. It is a requirement with which Ms Devers was able to comply in performing her employment.

Similarly, Ms Devers has not demonstrated that the requirement was unreasonable in all the circumstances. Her counsel placed considerable emphasis on Focus's failure to plead reliance on s 15(4) of the Act. However, the onus is on Ms Devers to demonstrate that the requirement or condition was one which was not reasonable in all the circumstances. At the time, Ms Devers was working approximately 15 hours per fortnight. It is also reasonable to infer that answering the door was incidental to the performance of her duties as a Disability Support Worker. In addition, Focus's policy was to not have staff members alone at the Bungower Road CRU at any time. Given Ms Devers's hours, the policy that staff members not work alone at any time and the incidental nature of the task, Focus's imposition of the requirement or condition that Ms Devers carry out her employment without the aid of flashing lights was reasonable.

Ms Devers's claim of indirect discrimination as a result of the failure to provide flashing lights prior to their installation in 2007 fails. Training sessions</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/20.html</AustLII>
<text>Australia is a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , opened for signature 13 December 2006, [2008] ATS 12 (entered into force 3 May 2008). However, this does not lead to the conclusion that the requirement or condition imposed by Focus was not reasonable. It is well settled that the mere fact of ratification does not import any rights or obligations into domestic law; see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1994) 183 CLR 273 at 286 7 per Mason CJ and Deane J, 315 per McHugh J and see also Nulyarimma v Thompson [1999] FCA 1192 ; (1999) 96 FCR 153 at [20] per Wilcox and Whitlam JJ. A convention may aid in interpretation of an Act where there is ambiguity but the Convention cannot be relied on to reach the conclusion that the requirement or condition was not reasonable; see Teoh at 287 per Mason CJ and Deane J. The relevant terms of the Act are unambiguous and the situation is not one of legitimate expectations created by a decision maker as described in Teoh . The Convention is irrelevant to the present proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Purvis v State of New South Wales [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/62.html</AustLII>
<text>In Purvis v State of New South Wales [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92 , Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ noted at [213] that the concept of less favourable treatment involves an objective assessment and comparison: 
 
 of the treatment which the discriminator gives, or proposes to give, to the aggrieved person and the treatment that the discriminator would give, or would propose to give, to a person without the aggrieved person's disability "in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different". 
 

The last phrase in s 5(1) qualified by s 5(2) of the Act, which provides that a disabled person's need for different accommodation or services does not constitute a material difference when determining whether the alleged discriminator has treated the disabled person less favourably than a person without the disability.

Section 5(1) of the Act requires that the circumstances surrounding the treatment of the disabled person are identified. What must then be examined is what would have been done in those circumstances if the relevant person were not disabled; see Purvis at [223] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. These circumstances are the objective features that surround the actual or intended treatment of the disabled person by the alleged discriminator; see Purvis at [224]. If the comparison reveals that the disabled individual was treated less favourably, the further question which must be asked is whether that difference was "because of" their disability; see Purvis at [236] per Callinan J.

The relevant questions for determination are, firstly, how would Focus have treated a person in these circumstances without Ms Devers's profound deafness? Secondly, if the treatment of Ms Devers was less favourable than the treatment that would be given to a person without her disability, was that difference because of her disability? Section 15 of the Act only applies if it is shown that Ms Devers was treated less favourably than a person without her disability would have been treated in circumstances that were the same as or were not materially different from the circumstances of Ms Devers's treatment.

In the present case, that the relevant "comparator" is an employee of Focus, in a similar role, without Ms Devers's disability who also has her attributes. For example, the relevant comparator in Purvis was a child without the applicant's disability who nevertheless displayed the same violent behaviour as the applicant; Purvis at [222] [225]. I will separately consider each allegation of direct discrimination and the relevant circumstances in relation to each allegation. Doctors' appointments

Ms Devers claims that Focus treated her less favourably than hearing staff in that it would not allow Ms Devers to attend doctors' appointments with deaf clients but would allow hearing staff to attend appointments. She said that she was only permitted to attend medical appointments when she went with David and Leigh Travaglia's mother, Ms Blake, and did so on two or three occasions.

Mr Edo Travaglia gave evidence that both Ms Sipthorpe and Ms Colleen McFarlane told him that "Focus management" had said that Ms Devers was not permitted to take clients to medical appointments as she was deaf and unable to communicate with doctors. However this evidence is hearsay and unsupported by other evidence.</text>
