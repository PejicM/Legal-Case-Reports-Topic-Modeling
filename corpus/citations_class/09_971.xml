<tocase>Re RUDDOCK (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs); Ex parte APPLICANT S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/60.html</AustLII>
<text>The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) was explained by Gummow and Heydon JJ, with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed, in Re RUDDOCK (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs); Ex parte APPLICANT S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [56] ('Applicant S154/2002 ') as follows: 
 '[56] ... The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate. Further, ... administrative decision-making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures. There, the court has to decide where, on the balance of probabilities, the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial.'

The relevant criterion for the grant of a protection visa to which s 65(1)(a)(ii) refers is to be found in s 36(2) of the Act, which, relevantly, for present purposes, provides as follows: 
 '36(2) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is: 

 
 (a) a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; or 

 
 (b) a non-citizen in Australia who is the spouse ... of a non-citizen who: 

 
 (i) is mentioned in paragraph (a); and 

 
 (ii) holds a protection visa.' 

 
The Refugees Convention means the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva on 28 July 1951, and the Refugees Protocol means the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at New York on 31 January 1967. Hereafter I will refer to the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol as 'the Convention.'</text>

<text>Plainly, satisfaction under s 65(1) is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities. Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 ('Rajalingam') refer to the 'civil standard of proof' being not irrelevant to the process of fact-finding by the Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1594 ; (2001) 114 FCR 212 ('Kalala') refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on 'a standard less than the balance of probabilities' (see at [25]). I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be 'satisfied' by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 (2006) 231 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>As has been said many times, proceedings in the Tribunal are not adversarial, but, rather, inquisitorial. The Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant. The Tribunal member conducting the relevant inquiry is not an adversarial cross-examiner, but an inquisitor obliged to be fair (see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Applicant S154/2002 at [57]; see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 [2006] HCA 53 ; (2006) 231 CLR 1 at [40] ).

The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark on. It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she may wish to advance before the Tribunal, and for the Tribunal to decide whether the relevant claim has been made out (see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Applicant S154/2002 at [57] [58]).</text>

<text>Procedural fairness does not require the Tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given. On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of pre-judgment (per Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [48] ).</text>

<tocase>NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another (2005) 222 CLR 161</tocase>
<text>In NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161 ('NAGV'), the High Court considered s 36(2) of the Act in the form in which it existed prior to the passage of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth). Relevantly, for present purposes, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [31]-[33]: 
 '31 ... a perusal of the Convention shows that, Art 33 apart, there is a range of requirements imposed upon Contracting States with respect to refugees some of which can fairly be characterised as "protection obligations". Free access to courts of law (Art 16(1)), temporary admission to refugee seamen (Art 11), and the measure of religious freedom provided by Art 4 are examples. 

 
 32 ... Section 36(2) does not use the term "refugee". But the "protection obligations under [the Convention]" of which it does speak are best understood as a general expression of the precept to which the Convention gives effect. The Convention provides for Contracting States to offer "surrogate protection" in the place of that of the country of nationality of which, in terms of Art 1A(2), the applicant is unwilling to avail himself. That directs attention to Art 1 and to the definition of the term "refugee". 

 
 33 Such a construction of s 36(2) is consistent with the legislative history of the Act. This indicates that the terms in which s 36 is expressed were adopted to do no more than present a criterion that the applicant for the protection visa had the status of a refugee because that person answered the definition of "refugee" spelled out in Art 1 of the Convention.' 

 
 (Footnotes omitted)

Article 33(1) of the Convention, to which reference was made in NAGV , provides: 
 '1. No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.'

The question of who answers the description of a 'refugee' is relevantly determined by Art 1 of the Convention, which relevantly provides: 
 'A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "refugee" shall apply to any person who: 
 ... 

 
 (2) ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence ... is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.'

The Convention does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned unless, by virtue of s 91R of the Act: 
 '(a) that reason is the essential and significant reason, or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons, for the persecution; and 

 
 (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and 

 
 (c) the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct.'</text>

<tocase>VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 233 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>The requirements of s 91R(1) of the Act provide a manifestation of a statutory intent to define persecution, and therefore serious harm, in strict and perhaps narrower terms than an unqualified reading of any unadapted Art 1A(2) of the Convention might otherwise require. 
The section is not concerned exclusively with or applicable to events in the past, rather than current or future circumstances. The Convention is framed to ensure that persons will not be exposed to persecution, as defined by Australian law, if they were to return to the country which they have left. If any threat or relevant risk is not current or prospective, then there can be no well-founded fear of persecution (per Callinan and Heydon JJ in VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 60 ; (2006) 233 CLR 1 ('VBAO') at [49]-[50]).

The word 'threat' as used in s 91R(2)(a) of the Act connotes 'risk' in the sense of danger or hazard (per Gummow J in VBAO at [18]). It is indicative of a likelihood of harm (per Gleeson CJ and Kirby J in VBAO at [1] and [3]).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar (2002) 210 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>The definition of 'refugee' in the Convention is couched in the present tense, and the text indicates that the position of the putative refugee is to be considered on the footing that that person is outside the country of nationality. The reference then made in the text to 'protection' is to 'external protection' by the country of nationality, for example, by the provision of diplomatic or consular protection, and not to the provision of 'internal protection' provided inside the country of nationality from which the refugee has departed (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ('Khawar') at [62], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 ; [2007] 233 CLR 18 ('SZATV') at [16]).

The definition of 'refugee' presents two cumulative conditions, the satisfaction of both of which is necessary for classification as a refugee. The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality 'owing to' fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason, which is well-founded both in an objective and a subjective sense. The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself 'of the protection of' the country of nationality. This includes persons who find themselves outside the country of their nationality and in a country where the country of nationality has no representation to which the refugee may have recourse to obtain protection. The second condition also is satisfied by a person who meets the requirements of the first condition and who, for a particular reason, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; that particular reason is that well-founded fear of persecution in the country of nationality which is identified in the first condition (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Khawar at [61], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [16]; see also Chan v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379 ('Chan'), Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ('Applicant A') at 283 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 ('S152') at [19]).</text>

It is well settled since Chan and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 ('Guo') at 571-572 and 596 that the requirement that the 'fear' be 'well-founded' adds an objective requirement to the examination of the facts and that this examination is not confined to those facts which form the basis of the fear experienced by the particular applicant (per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [18]). A fear is 'well-founded' where there is a real substantial basis for it (see Guo at 572).

The so-called 'relocation principle' was considered by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [9] - [22]. At [11] their Honours observed that any notion of 'relocation' and of the 'reasonableness' thereof is to be derived, if at all, as a matter of inference from the more generally stated provisions of the definition of 'refugee' contained in the Convention. At [24], their Honours said: 
 '24 ... What is "reasonable", in the sense of "practicable", must depend upon the particular circumstances of the applicant for refugee status and the impact upon that person of relocation of the place of residence within the country of nationality.'

In SZATV the Tribunal had considered that the appellant could reasonably have relocated within Ukraine. The effect of the Tribunal's stance was that the appellant in that case was expected to move elsewhere in Ukraine and live 'discreetly' so as not to attract the adverse interest of the authorities in his new location lest he be further persecuted by reason of his political opinion. The High Court ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and that the appeal from the decision of the Federal Court on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia be allowed. Application of relevant principles to the present case

The first applicant is a non-citizen in Australia who is a citizen of India. The second appellant is a non-citizen in Australia who is the spouse of the first appellant. She does not contend that she is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention.

The appellants arrived in Australia on 4 March 2008 having left India on the previous day. They each travelled on passports issued by the Indian government and entered Australia relying upon three month visitor visas. On 17 April 2008 the appellants applied for Protection (Class XA) visas. On 3 July 2008 a delegate of the Minister decided that the application of the appellants for protection visas should be refused as their claims did not meet the requisite criterion for a protection visa set out in s 36(2) of the Act.</text>
