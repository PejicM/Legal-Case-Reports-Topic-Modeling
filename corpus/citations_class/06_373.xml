<tocase>Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott (1987) 71 ALR 408 </tocase>
<text>22 The Tribunal next drew attention to the following dicta of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (comprising Deputy President R A Layton and B C Lock and J T B Linn as members) in Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown (1985) 8 ALD 133 at 136, in a context of eligibility for defence force retirement pension and death benefits, where dependency was explained as 'a financial concept as distinct from an emotional concept...' . To similar effect in Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott (1987) 71 ALR 408, the notions of 'financial dependency', 'necessities of life' and 'lower order needs' were emphasised . Those authorities were apparently cited to the Tribunal by the Trustee for the propositions that the statutory notion of 'dependence' the subject of ss 8A and 8B of the Superannuation Act relates to financial support for 'necessities of life' or 'lower order needs' and that 'financial dependence' , in the situation of an applicant for relief meant being 'primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon the person' . Moreover the words 'in the main' were said by the Tribunal to indicate that total dependence is not required, and further that the Tribunal indicated its expectation that so much would be less so for the notion of ' substantially dependent ' (the s 8A(4)(a) expression) than for financial dependence without qualification. As for the terms ' necessities of life ' and ' lower order needs ', the Tribunal considered on the other hand that the same should not be taken to mean ' bare necessities' , that is, the minimum needed to survive in indigent circumstances. Faull was said by the Tribunal to seemingly support the view in any event that a more reasonable interpretation should be adopted having regard to the person's station in life, and the Tribunal observed indeed in that context of its reasoning as follows:
 
 'There is no suggestion from the evidence that the [appellant's] lifestyle was excessive, yet she appears to have been having some difficulties in meeting her normal expenditure without the financial support given by the [deceased].'

24 Nevertheless in the Tribunal's concluding view, the position here involved was properly addressed and dealt with by Scott, the reasoning whereof the Tribunal purportedly adopted. The Tribunal summarised the reasoning in Scott on what may be described as the 'wholly or substantially dependent' issue (that is, picking up reference to 'wholly and substantially ' in s 8A(4)(a)) as follows:
 
 'In that case, the Federal Court was considering the meaning of the expression "wholly or substantially dependent" in the definition of "spouse" in s 3 of the Relevant Act (as it then was; the current s 3 does not contain a definition of "spouse"). The Court came to the view that where the word "substantially" finds its place in the phrase "wholly or substantially dependent", it must be construed having regard to the whole phrase. This was because where the word "substantially" is placed within that phrase, connotations of the term "substantially" is governed by the conjugational position of the word "wholly" immediately before it. In other words, that "substantial" does not stand alone, but is related to "wholly". On this basis, the Court came to the view that "substantially" does not simply mean something more than trivial, minimal or nominal, instead it meant in relation to a person in the expression "wholly or substantially dependent" that the person is primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon a person (that is, upon the Deceased Member). The Court also cautioned against the use of percentage and instead suggested as the approach to consider whether the person (the Complainant) is primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon the other person (the Deceased Member) in the context of that particular relationship.' 


The Tribunal proceeded to point out that the foregoing view as to whole or substantial dependence, summarised by the Full Federal Court in Scott , was applied in the context of the joint judgment of Branson and Hely JJ in Graovac .</text>

<tocase>Faull v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (Supreme Court of New South Wales 26 November 1999 (unreported)</tocase>
<text>20 The Tribunal indicated its awareness moreover that ' ... it is common in many other superannuation schemes for the dependence test for similar situations to be whether the claimant was "wholly or partially" dependent on the deceased' and where 'quite small regular payments have been found to be sufficient to constitute partial dependency'. The Tribunal was referred to Faull v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (Supreme Court of New South Wales 26 November 1999 unreported), where the deceased had died about the same time as the deceased member, and where the mother who worked and earned 'some $39,000 per annum' was held to be partially dependent on her son who paid her $30 per week board each week, being payments that were made regularly and could apparently be relied upon, even though they may not have made a great difference to the mother's standard of living. Nevertheless the Court held as follows:
 
 'The payment of that amount augmented her other income and, to that extent, she was dependent upon the deceased for receipt of some of her income. Accordingly, she was "partially dependent" upon the payment made by the deceased.' 


The s 8A(4)(a) tests refer to 'wholly or substantially dependent on the other person at the time'.

21 In the present case, as the Tribunal pointed out, in the final period of time prior to his death, the deceased was giving the appellant about $100 per fortnight or $2,600 per year, representing an additional ten per centum (10%) on her gross income derived. The Tribunal further pointed to evidence that the appellant had found a need for further income, as a consequence whereof she had commenced weekend work, but ceased that work at the deceased's request. In that context, the Tribunal drew the following conclusions:
 
 'It seems that it was the payments made to her by the [deceased] that enabled her to do this. Moreover, the $100 per fortnight seems to have become fairly regular and it may well be that the [appellant] came to rely upon it (otherwise, she is unlikely to have given up the weekend work). If the test here were partial dependency, on the basis of Faull, such payments might well be sufficient for dependency to exist. 
 
 But in this case, the test is "wholly or substantially dependent", not "wholly or partially" (or even just "partially") dependent. The question is whether these tests are virtually the same or significantly different. Both have quantitative aspects, albeit of uncertain dimensions. The Tribunal sees issues like whether the payments were secured in some way to the [appellant] as being of less importance than whether they were relatively regular in such a way that she reasonably rely upon them continuing.'

22 The Tribunal next drew attention to the following dicta of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (comprising Deputy President R A Layton and B C Lock and J T B Linn as members) in Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown (1985) 8 ALD 133 at 136, in a context of eligibility for defence force retirement pension and death benefits, where dependency was explained as 'a financial concept as distinct from an emotional concept...' . To similar effect in Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott (1987) 71 ALR 408, the notions of 'financial dependency', 'necessities of life' and 'lower order needs' were emphasised . Those authorities were apparently cited to the Tribunal by the Trustee for the propositions that the statutory notion of 'dependence' the subject of ss 8A and 8B of the Superannuation Act relates to financial support for 'necessities of life' or 'lower order needs' and that 'financial dependence' , in the situation of an applicant for relief meant being 'primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon the person' . Moreover the words 'in the main' were said by the Tribunal to indicate that total dependence is not required, and further that the Tribunal indicated its expectation that so much would be less so for the notion of ' substantially dependent ' (the s 8A(4)(a) expression) than for financial dependence without qualification. As for the terms ' necessities of life ' and ' lower order needs ', the Tribunal considered on the other hand that the same should not be taken to mean ' bare necessities' , that is, the minimum needed to survive in indigent circumstances. Faull was said by the Tribunal to seemingly support the view in any event that a more reasonable interpretation should be adopted having regard to the person's station in life, and the Tribunal observed indeed in that context of its reasoning as follows:

<tocase>Furmage v Social Security Commission (1979-1981) New Zealand Administrative Reports Vol 2 page 75</tocase>
<text>15 Accordingly the Tribunal reasoned that just as in normal parlance, it seemed to be unlikely that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased member, whereby they occupied separate residences, but saw one another regularly and even slept together on occasions, was one that would normally be described as 'ordinarily living together' , or necessarily 'permanent , or as having a 'bona fide domestic basis' , within par (b) of s 8A(2). The Tribunal considered that the following dictum of Barker J in Furmage v Social Security Commission (1979-1981) 2 NZ AR 75 at 80 to be here apposite, involving as it did the operation of the expression 'living together on a domestic basis' appearing in certain New Zealand social security legislation as follows, ' ... the Commission may in its discretion... regard as husband and wife, any man and woman who, not being legally married, are in the opinion of the Commission living together on a domestic basis as husband and wife and may in its discretion... terminate or reduce... any benefit already granted accordingly... '. As to the operation of that expression, the Commission contended as follows:
 
 'Obviously all the elements of consortium need not appear in every relationship under [the legislative provision] just as they need not necessarily appear in every marriage. However, the Legislature has chosen to emphasise one element of consortium ie the "living together under one roof" aspect by its use of the words "on a domestic basis". The section requires more than ... "cohabitation"... and more than not "living apart"... [but]... has gone out of its way to add these limiting words to an otherwise fairly broad and flexible concept.'

16 As I have already indicated, the Tribunal considered that there was no qualifying marital relationship between the appellant and the deceased within s 8A(1) of the Superannuation Act essentially for the reasons I have summarised as well as cited, nor within what may be described as the deeming and illustrative provisions of s 8A(2). Accordingly in the Tribunal's opinion, whether the Trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in its operation depended on whether the circumstances of the appellant came within the scope of s 8B(3) of the Superannuation Act . So much also involved or concerned the issue whether the appellant was ' wholly or substantially dependent ' on the deceased at the time of his death within s 8A(4) , being the further issue to which I will now turn.

17 For the purposes of addressing that further issue, the Tribunal accepted, as indeed the Trustee pointed out, the extent of variation in the closeness of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased, over the years, but considered that ' ... it is the period nearest to [the time of death] that is the most important ', since ' [e]ven if earlier in the relationship the [appellant] was not so dependent, that is irrelevant if she was so dependent at the time of death ', and the Tribunal considered accordingly ' that it is most appropriate to concentrate on the last years and, having regard to s 8A(2) of the Act, the last three years, which is from 1992 on '.

43 The appellant made a further 'major complaint... that the Tribunal referred to the New Zealand case of Furmage ,' though not in relation to the passage from its reasons which I have earlier cited therefrom, but in relation to an earlier passage in those reasons at 79, where the following appears:
 
 'However, I cannot ignore the additional words of the statute "on a domestic basis". I consider that these words require a living together under the same roof on a basis of some permanence.' 


It is apparent, from the Tribunal's citation of that passage, that the Tribunal had in mind part of the text of par (b) of subs 8A(2), where reference appears to ' ...ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person's husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis ' . It does not seem to me to have been inapposite to cite, whether for comparison or illustration of reasoning, that instance of judicial consideration of what was a not dissimilar text of statutory regulation. In the normal course, for a married couple to live under the same roof would at least assist exemplification as to what might constitute in certain circumstances ' ordinarily lived' by a ' ... husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis ' with the other. Of course exceptional circumstances, such as residing in accommodation whilst absent for instance interstate on business, or in the course of visitation overseas of relatives, or in the course of hospitalisation, would normally fulfil in any event the subs 9A(5) circumstance of ' temporary absence' .

44 It follows from those conclusions that the appeal should be dismissed.
 
 
 I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

<tocase>In the Marriage of Pavey (1976) 1 Fam LR11, 358</tocase>
<text>12 The Tribunal discussed the scope of operation of the statutory notion of 'marital relationship' and concluded that whilst there are 'various criteria to consider, there is no hard and fast rule that must be complied with in deciding whether a "marital relationship" existed' . Initially the Trustee drew attention to two authorities of the early decades of the twentieth century which exemplified traditional notions of the matrimonial relationship, but moved promptly thereafter to the more contemporary analysis of juridical decisions of the last three decades, commencing with the discussion approvingly by Evatt CJ, Demack and Watson JJ, in the context of their joint judgment In the Marriage of Pavey (1976) 25 FLR 450, of what had been earlier said In the Marriage of Todd (No 2) (1976) 25 FLR 260 at 262 by Watson J as follows:
 
 'In my view "separation" means more than physical separation it involves the destruction of the marital relationship... Separation can only occur in the sense used by the Act where one or both of the spouses form the intention to sever or not to resume the marital relationship and act on that intention, or alternatively act as if the marital relationship has been severed. What comprises the marital relationship for each couple will vary. Marriage involves many elements some or all of which may be present in a particular marriage elements such as dwelling under the same roof, sexual intercourse, mutual society and protection, recognition of the existence of the marriage by both spouses in public and private relationships. 
 
 When it is asserted that a separation has taken place it may be necessary to examine and contrast the state of the marital relationship before and after the alleged separation. Whether there has been a separation will be a question of fact to be determined in each case.' 


The foregoing sentence '[w]hat comprises the marital relationship for each couple will vary' was adopted by the Tribunal as reflective of 'a practical, commonsense point of view' . In that context of authority, the Tribunal thought that '[t]he Complainant and the Deceased Member, for their own purposes, over a period, fashioned a relationship that suited them and they may well have regarded it as the most appropriate marriage for them in all their circumstances' , the Tribunal adding the observation that ' [i]t is even quite arguable that it may have been a "marital relationship" at common law, which is what the Complainant's lawyers seem to have been submitting' . So much was described by the Tribunal however as not determinative of the issue presently arising, and understandably so, in the light of the critical words of s 8A, which at least include '... the person ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person's husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide basis '.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Graovac [1999] FCA 1690</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1690.html</AustLII>
<text>13 As to the import and operation of 'wholly and substantially' appearing in ss 8A(4)(a) and 8B(3)(d), I was referred to an analysis of the statutory notion of whole or substantial dependency appearing in the reasons the joint judgment of Branson and Hely JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Graovac [1999] FCA 1690 , being a decision made otherwise than in a matrimonial context. After reference to usages in statutory contexts of superannuation, social security and bankruptcy legislation, the following appears at [11]-[12] of that joint judgment:
 
 'Thus Scott's case, and cases which have followed it, treat "substantially" in the phrase "wholly or substantially dependent" as involving the notion of predominance. When the Full Court in Scott adopted the paraphrase of a person who is "primarily, essentially or in the main" dependent upon another person, in our opinion the Court was describing, in slightly different ways, the same idea, rather than expressing three slightly different ideas. That colours or confines the signification of "essentially". 
 
 We respectfully disagree with [the primary judge's] conclusion ... that A is wholly or substantially dependent on B as well as on C. A is dependent upon both, but is not wholly or substantially dependent on B because it is upon C that A is mainly dependent. Whilst B's contribution may be essential to A's support, the notion of predominance which is implicit in the phrase "wholly or substantially" dependent, is lacking.' 


Although that dicta occurred of course in relation to a different legislative context, its emphasis on ' the notion of predominance ' seems to me to carry through by way of assistance to the resolution of the issues of legislative construction here arising.

14 The Tribunal considered that ' the real question is not whether the ultimate relationship of the [appellant] and the Deceased Member was a "marital relationship" at common law, but rather whether it was a "marital relationship" for the purposes of ss 8A and 8B ' of the Superannuation Act , which the Tribunal described ' as a materially different issue '. The Tribunal's reasoning continued to the effect that for the purposes of the Superannuation Act , s 8A(1) stipulates that there is a 'marital relationship if two people ordinarily lived together as husband and wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis at the relevant time, and further that it was ' fairly clear ' that those s 8A(1) terms such as ' ordinarily ', ' lived together ', ' permanent ' and ' bona fide domestic basis ' imported requirements over and above those that may be necessary for an undefined marital relationship, and should not be regarded as merely surplusage. There is clear force in those observations.

24 Nevertheless in the Tribunal's concluding view, the position here involved was properly addressed and dealt with by Scott, the reasoning whereof the Tribunal purportedly adopted. The Tribunal summarised the reasoning in Scott on what may be described as the 'wholly or substantially dependent' issue (that is, picking up reference to 'wholly and substantially ' in s 8A(4)(a)) as follows:
 
 'In that case, the Federal Court was considering the meaning of the expression "wholly or substantially dependent" in the definition of "spouse" in s 3 of the Relevant Act (as it then was; the current s 3 does not contain a definition of "spouse"). The Court came to the view that where the word "substantially" finds its place in the phrase "wholly or substantially dependent", it must be construed having regard to the whole phrase. This was because where the word "substantially" is placed within that phrase, connotations of the term "substantially" is governed by the conjugational position of the word "wholly" immediately before it. In other words, that "substantial" does not stand alone, but is related to "wholly". On this basis, the Court came to the view that "substantially" does not simply mean something more than trivial, minimal or nominal, instead it meant in relation to a person in the expression "wholly or substantially dependent" that the person is primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon a person (that is, upon the Deceased Member). The Court also cautioned against the use of percentage and instead suggested as the approach to consider whether the person (the Complainant) is primarily, essentially or in the main dependent upon the other person (the Deceased Member) in the context of that particular relationship.'

<tocase>Roy v Sturgeon (1986) 11 NSWLR 454</tocase>
<text>30 The appellant submitted in any event that what constitutes 'living together on a bona fide basis' is a matter to be determined on the facts of each case, drawing attention thereby to dictum of Powell J in Roy v Sturgeon (1986) 11 NSWLR 454 at 458-459, where the following appears:
 
 '... it seems to me that each case will involve the Court making a value judgment having regard to a variety of factors relating to the particular relationship, those factors including, but not being limited to, the following: 
 1. the duration of the relationship; 
 2. the nature and extent of the common residence; 
 3. whether or not a sexual relationship existed; 
 4. the degree of financial interdependence, and any arrangements for support, between or by the parties; 
 5. the ownership, use and acquisition of property; 
 6. the procreation of children; 
 7. the care and support of children; 
 8. the performance of household duties; 
 9. the degree of mutual commitment and mutual support; 
 10. reputation and "public" aspects of the relationship.' 


Those observations in Roy were made in the context of the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 (NSW), where the statutory definition of ' de facto relationship ' meant ' the relationship between de facto partners, being the relationship of living or having lived together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not married to each other' . Sections 8A and 8B of the subject legislation were of course enacted in 1992, and the text thereof is more specific than the earlier State of New South Wales legislation addressed in Roy . Part of the present statutory criteria addresses inter alia the s 8A(4)(d) requirement to consider evidence establishing whether ' the persons jointly owned a home which was their usual residence '.

31 In any event, the appellant's submissions continued to the effect that by limiting itself to a consideration of whether there was a common residence, the Tribunal applied the wrong test and failed to take account of other significant indicators such as what the couple themselves considered their relationship to be and what others, who knew the couple, considered the relationship to be. I have encountered difficult with that submission by the appellant, which to my perception derives insufficient support from the text of ss 8A and 8B, whether explicitly or implicitly.

32 Thereafter the appellant referred to the opinion of the Tribunal '... that when the [Superannuation] Act speaks of dependency it is referring primarily to financial dependency, so it is the sums of money paid by the Deceased Member to the Complainant in the period prior to his death that seem the most important consideration', and contended that in so finding, the Tribunal ignored the ordinary meaning of the word dependency which can include emotional and/or physical dependency. Emotional dependency is not readily susceptible of course to financial measurement. The criteria described by ss 8A and 8B are necessarily or at least expediently objective, and although subjective factors may well be sometimes relevant in evidentiary terms in order to throw light upon the satisfaction or otherwise objectively of the statutory requirement as to ' ordinarily living on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis ', it is not apparent that the same may compellingly enter the ultimate assessment or computation of a pension entitlement of a surviving spouse or partner otherwise existing pursuant to the Superannuation Act .</text>
