<tocase>De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 137</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/137.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 137 at [8] - [10] , Wilcox, Sackville and Merkel JJ held that s 85A(1) is intended to remove any ground for anticipation or expectation that, unless cause were shown for another order, costs would follow the event. Nonetheless, s 85A acknowledges that the Court has an overriding discretion as to costs and does not expressly impose a limit on the scope of the discretion. They said that there was no requirement that a threshold condition be met before the Court is empowered to make a costs order. Thus, the exercise of the discretion under s 85A(1) does not require a finding of a fact or the formation of an opinion that there has been unreasonable conduct or that special circumstances exist.</text>

<tocase>McKenzie v South Australia [2006] FCA 891</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/891.html</AustLII>
<text>23 However, they held that s 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party has acted unreasonably. That provision does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1). Their Honours held that the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order were left to the Court's discretion, which had to be exercised judicially. They said that the starting point was that each party would bear its own costs unless the Court determined that it was appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs. They emphasised that the starting point was not that costs ordinarily followed the event. Their Honours followed what Lee J had said at first instance in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305 at 311-312 [31] - [37] . A similar approach has been taken in McKenzie v South Australia [2006] FCA 891 at [8] per Finn J and Reid v South Australia [2007] FCA 1479 at [53] - [54] per Finn J. In Reid [2007] FCA 1479 at [54] Finn J said that it is not proper to use the power to award costs to punish either a successful or unsuccessful party or to use it to operate as a deterrent to other would-be applicants.</text>

<tocase>Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/11.html</AustLII>
<text>24 It is inappropriate to read a provision, such as s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , which confers jurisdiction on, or grants powers to, a court, by making conditions or imposing limitations which are not to be found in the words used: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 81 [21] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; see also Owners of "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 5 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421. The section contains no positive indication of the considerations upon which the Court is to determine by whom or to what extent costs to be paid. The power must be exercised judicially, not arbitrarily or capriciously or so as to frustrate the legislative intent. In the absence of some positive indication of the considerations on which a grant or refusal of consent is to depend, the discretion is 'unconfined except in so far as the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the statutory enactments may enable the Court to pronounce given reasons to be definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view' as Dixon J said in Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning [1947] HCA 21 ; (1947) 74 CLR 492 at 505; see also The Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 62 ; (1979) 144 CLR 45 at 49 per Stephen, Mason, Murphy, Aicken and Wilson JJ; Oshlack 193 CLR at 81 [22]; Probiotic Limited v The University of Melbourne [2008] FCAFC 5 at [47] in my judgment, with which Finn J at [1] and Besanko J at [82] agreed.

25 There is no absolute rule that the sole purpose of a costs order made under a provision such as s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act is to compensate one party at the expense of another under the Judicature Act system: Oshlack 193 CLR at 89 [43]. The general power conferred by s 43 is not to be narrowly construed. However, where there has been some delinquency on the part of an unsuccessful party, the Court has power to order costs against that party, and sometimes on a scale greater than party/party costs: Oshlack 193 CLR at 89 [44]; Probiotic [2008] FCAFC 5 at [48] .</text>

<tocase>Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/745.html</AustLII>
<text>27 The power to order costs under s 85A(2) is expressed in similar, but not identical terms, in the provisions of s 824(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) which were considered by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. He gave that section a wide construction on its plain and natural meaning: Paras 152 FCR at 538 [16]. But Young J held that the applicant for the order had to satisfy the Court that, relevantly, the other party's conduct 'involved unreasonable acts or omissions that caused the [party applying for the order] to incur costs': Paras 152 FCR at 539 [19].

28 At the hearing of the costs argument, counsel for the Birri-Gubba People argued that in preparing a matter for trial, the litigious landscape often changes. He pointed to the fact that it could be expected in ordinary litigation that some issues which were hotly contested at an interlocutory stage might fall away by the time of the trial as minds became focused on the real issues. And, he pointed out that since at least March 2007 all parties had been on notice that the description of the claim group would have to change in light of the latest anthropological research obtained by Birri-Gubba People as to the correct identity of the persons who could claim native title over the relevant lands and waters in the vicinity of Cape Upstart. Counsel for the Birri-Gubba People also argued that there were practical problems with the funding available to the land council.

29 The land council is presently the representative body under the Native Title Act . It was entitled to prioritise and make determinations as to the funding, staff, resources and complexity of this matter as one of a number for which it was responsible. Counsel argued that there was no basis on which the Court's discretion under s 85A of the Native Title Act was enlivened to warrant the making of a costs order against the Birri-Gubba People. He argued that the jurisdiction to award costs under s 85A should be only be exercised in circumstances where there were special or unusual features of the case, or where there had been conduct in the nature of an abuse of process, improper purpose, contempt or unreasonableness. In essence, that argument sought to confine the Court's power to award costs to circumstances which would warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis in ordinary civil litigation (that is, in litigation where the Court's power to award costs does not have the constraint of s 85A(1) of the Act).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/1.html</AustLII>
<text>36 The object of the Court is to decide the rights of the parties in and to resolve controversies. It is not to punish parties for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases. Thus, the courts have developed principles as to when amendments may be made to pleadings to raise or change the form of the litigation, even at very late stages, provided that the other party can be compensated by an appropriate order for costs: Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 152-155 per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.

37 I consider that it was unreasonable of the Birri Gubba People to present a total of five lists, none of which, on final consideration, produced even one person whom they wished to call. The Birri Gubba People were represented by lawyers and the land council at all times. They were not in the position of litigants in person unable to make informed forensic judgments or to properly present their case to the Court. On the evidence before me, no proper, considered attention was given to the inclusion of any of the persons in the five lists that were provided by the Birri Gubba People for the purposes of identifying whose evidence ought be preserved. This is evident from the fact that the end result is that no such witness has been identified, although one person who was clearly an appropriate witness, has unfortunately passed away in the meantime.

38 On a number of occasions in open court the state of preparation of the land council was disclosed as being in disarray. I have no doubt that there was a sincere attempt to identify persons whose evidence might need to be taken on a number of occasions. But the attempt does not appear to have been undertaken by a lawyer familiar with litigation or with a view to determining whether or not any of those persons ought to be called to give evidence and what evidence he or she could give until, ultimately, the forensic decision was taken not to call any of them.</text>
