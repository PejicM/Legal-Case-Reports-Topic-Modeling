<tocase>Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/226.html</AustLII>
<text>16 Unlike O 20 r 2 which applies generally, s 84C is clearly limited to native title determination applications under the Act. The language of s 84C and O 20 r 2 is dissimilar in that s 84C refers to "strike-out" of the application, whereas O 20 r 2 deals with permanent stay or summary dismissal of the proceedings. Further, the issues of which proof is required under each provision differs in that s 84C applies where an application does not comply with ss 61 , 61A or 62 whereas O 20 r 2 is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or the proceeding is an abuse of process. To that extent, s 84C is concerned with matters of form and authority rather than the merit of any native title determination (Branson J in Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 85).

18 The cautious approach of the Court as described in Williams [2004] FCAFC 178 was more recently reaffirmed by the Full Court in Bodney 140 FCR at 89, where Stone J (with whom Spender and Branson JJ agreed on this point) said that notwithstanding the operation of s 84C in the context of native title applications, the Court approaches strike-out applications under this section in the same way as applications under O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules (see also Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at 497, Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951 at [2] - [3] , McKenzie v State Government of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at 221).</text>

<tocase>Booth v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 418</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/418.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The importance of the authorisation of a claim was emphasised by Tamberlin J in Booth v State of Queensland [2003] FCA 418 at [10] - [11] where his Honour said in relation to that case:
 
 The applicant must be authorised by all members of the Native Title Claim Group. In the present application the persons who compromise the Native Title Claim Group are not identified either by name or by reference or by any sufficient description.
 There is also a lack of evidence that the Native Title Claim Group, which is alleged to have authorised Mr Booth, had any applicable traditional decision-making process or that any particular process was followed. There is no evidence that the Native Title Claim Group agreed to and adopted some other decision-making process in relation to authorising the applicant to make the application. Nor is there any evidence that the process has been recognised or that any process has been followed.

35 These comments are equally applicable in the case before me. Other than an assertion by the applicant that the late Oodgeroo, the late Kath Walker, has authorised the applicant to make the application, and that such authorisation is through "Traditional Custom and Lore", there is no evidence that the applicant is authorised by the claim group, even to the extent that the claim group in this case can be identified. No details of the decisions that the claim group made are provided. There is no evidence of the process, or that any particular process was recognised or followed by the claim group (cf Booth [2003] FCA 418 at [11] ).

36 I again note the affidavit of Ms Waters which states that the Oodgeroo descendants are part of the Gonzales family group, one of 11 family groups forming the Quandamooka Claim group. QSNTS has submitted that there is no suggestion that the smaller family group, the Oodgeroo group, could establish particular rights and interests which the larger Quandamooka Claim group cannot. Further, I note the affidavits filed by Jonathon Patrick Malone sworn 23 January 2007 and Edward Ruska sworn 7 February 2007, who depose that they are members of the Noonukul of Minjerrabah and that they did not authorise the making of the Noonukul Application and were not advised of or involved in the process of authorisation.</text>

<tocase>Briggs on behalf of the Gumbangirri People v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2004] FCA 1056 ; (2004) 141 FCR 17</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1056.html</AustLII>
<text>26 As pointed out by Mansfield J in Landers 128 FCR at 504:
 
 "The proper identification of the native title claim group is the central focus or focal issue of a native title determination application. It is the native title claim group which provides authorisation under s 251B , and it is the group on whose behalf the claim is then pursued and, if successful, in whose favour a determination of native title is then made."

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/187.html</AustLII>
<text>28 I agree with the submission of QSNTS that the group is not described sufficiently so as to allow one to ascertain whether any particular person is in that group: cf Dieri People v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 at 379, Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 at [1206] - [1225] ). Indeed, if anything, the descriptions of claimants provided in various places in the application are contradictory in that "the members of the family bloodline groups to the island of Minjerribah and the waters of Quandamooka" is clearly a larger group than the "identified descendants of Oodgeroo the Late Kath Walker". I note in this regard the affidavit of Ms Waters, consultant historian, sworn 24 January 2007, where she deposes that 11 family groups make up the Quandamooka Claim groups.

37 Accordingly in my view, and in circumstances where, despite the applicant's non-appearance in Court, the applicant has had an opportunity to put forward evidence in relation to this and other issues, I am satisfied that not only is there a lack of clarity as to the persons who make up the claim group, but that in any event the applicant was not authorised to make the application on behalf of such people of the claim group as have been identified. It therefore appears that the applicant is not authorised to make an application on behalf of all of the claim group. If the applicant represents a family subgroup which claims to hold native title, it is not the group which holds the common or group rights or interests within s 61 of the Act ( Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] , Dieri 127 FCR at 377, Hillig [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] ).</text>

<tocase>Hillig as administrator of the Wormi Local Aboriginal Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 115</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/115.html</AustLII>
<text>31 QSNTS submits that if the claim group has not been properly identified in accordance with s 61(4) , then it is not possible for the claim to be authorised in a manner which complies with ss 61 , 62 and s 251B , even if the requirements in s 251B are met. QSNTS cites Hillig as administrator of the Wormi Local Aboriginal Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 115 at [70] in support.

32 QSNTS further submits that in any event, the Noonukul Application does not meet the authorisation requirements of s 61(1) and s 251B. Indeed, QSNTS submit that there is simply no evidence presented that any type of authorisation process was followed to authorise the making of the Noonukul Application.

33 Part A s 2 of the Form 1 of the Native Title Act "Native Title Determination Application Claimant Application" provides for details about authorisation. The applicant asserts in that part of the Noonukul Application that:
 
 This Application has been authorised pursuant to s 251B(1)(a) of the Native Title Act 1993 
 ...
 The Applicant has been authorised to make this application for a claim over the determination area through Traditional Custom and Lore by the authority of the late Oodgeroo the late Kath Walker and carry out the business pertaining to it.

37 Accordingly in my view, and in circumstances where, despite the applicant's non-appearance in Court, the applicant has had an opportunity to put forward evidence in relation to this and other issues, I am satisfied that not only is there a lack of clarity as to the persons who make up the claim group, but that in any event the applicant was not authorised to make the application on behalf of such people of the claim group as have been identified. It therefore appears that the applicant is not authorised to make an application on behalf of all of the claim group. If the applicant represents a family subgroup which claims to hold native title, it is not the group which holds the common or group rights or interests within s 61 of the Act ( Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] , Dieri 127 FCR at 377, Hillig [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] ).</text>

<tocase>Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/178.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Notwithstanding these distinctions, the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike-out under s 84C with those of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2. As observed by Lander J (North and Dowsett JJ agreeing) in Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178: 
 
 [48] Section 84C only applies to applications which do not comply with ss 61 , 61A and 62 . However, an application under s 84C, if successful, has the very serious consequence that the native title application is struck out. Such a result is akin to a court proceeding being summarily dismissed, or at least dismissed before any hearing on the merits. No court proceeding is summarily dismissed except in a very clear case: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129.
 [49] Applications for native title are brought by representatives of the native title claim group. The dismissal of an application because, for example, the applicant has not been authorised means the dismissal of the native title claim group's claim. The repercussions, therefore, are far reaching. I see no reason why an application to strike out a native title claim under s 84C should be treated any differently to any other application to dismiss a claim summarily. The power should be exercised sparingly and with caution, and only when the Court is satisfied that the moving party has made out a clear case that the applicant has not complied with the relevant section and cannot, by amending the application, comply. Section 84C assumes that a party might respond to a strike out application by amending the claim to comply with the requirements of the Act. A claim can be amended without obtaining leave.

18 The cautious approach of the Court as described in Williams [2004] FCAFC 178 was more recently reaffirmed by the Full Court in Bodney 140 FCR at 89, where Stone J (with whom Spender and Branson JJ agreed on this point) said that notwithstanding the operation of s 84C in the context of native title applications, the Court approaches strike-out applications under this section in the same way as applications under O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules (see also Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at 497, Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951 at [2] - [3] , McKenzie v State Government of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at 221).</text>
