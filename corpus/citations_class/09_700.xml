<text>In Comcare v Commonwealth (2007) 163 FCR 207 ; [2007] FCA 662 ( Trooper Lawrence ) Madgwick J said at [116] [123]: 
 116. The overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all , the relevant circumstances: Coochey v Commonwealth [2005] FCA 1165 ; (2005) 149 FCR 312 and the cases there cited. 

 
 117. The relevant circumstances will vary from case to case and by reference to the objects of the particular legislation which has been contravened. 

 
 118. Pursuant to s 3 of the OHS Act the objects of the Act include: 

 (a) to secure the health, safety and welfare at work of employees of the Commonwealth and of Commonwealth authorities; and
 
 ...
 
 
 
 (d) to promote an occupational environment for such employees at work that is adapted to their needs relating to health and safety;
 
 ...
 
 
 (f) to encourage and assist employers, employees and other persons to whom obligations are imposed under the Act to observe those obligations; and
 
 
 
 (g) to provide for effective remedies if obligations are not met, through the use of civil remedies and, in serious cases, criminal sanctions.
 
 
 119. The applicant contends that guidance may be had from decisions relating to penalty under State occupational health and safety laws which import like obligations on employers. 

 
 120. Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: 

 
 (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety;
 (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable;
 (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer;
 (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty. However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety;
 (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision;
 (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act;
 (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. This implies constant vigilance. Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive. In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future. This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety;
 (viii) regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration; 
 (ix) the neglect of simple, well-known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury, take a matter towards the worst case category;
 (x) the objective seriousness of the offence, without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties. 

 The applicant contends that the above approach is particularly relevant in the context of the subject OHS Act. The evident purpose of making the Commonwealth liable to a penalty for a breach of s 16(1) of the OHS Act is to mark the seriousness of the conduct and act as a deterrent to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth agencies and other persons who may be subject to the OHS Act.
 
 122. The respondent submitted: 

 
 Care must be taken in the use of criminal cases arising under occupational health and safety legislation in the various State jurisdictions. Unlike subsection 16(1) of the OHS Act, the New South Wales equivalent imposes an absolute obligation on an employer to secure the health and safety of its employees, a circumstance that has guided the New South Wales courts in their approach to penalties in criminal proceedings under the NSW legislation. Subsection 11(2) of the OHS Act very deliberately excludes the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities (other than Government business enterprises) from liability for prosecution for an offence under the Act. The reasons for this exclusion must go beyond simply easing the procedural and evidentiary burdens faced by Comcare and its investigators in making the Commonwealth accountable for occupational health and safety breaches. As Giles JA observed in Adler v ASIC [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 504 , [658]: "Civil penalties can be regarded as punitive, with a resemblance to fines imposed on criminal offenders, but the resemblance is not identity".
 
 I nevertheless consider that, despite the differences between the New South Wales and the Commonwealth legislation, and bearing in mind that these are civil and not criminal proceedings, the considerations enumerated above, mainly enunciated in decisions of the New South Wales Industrial Commission, provide useful, analogical, general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act.
 
Both parties accepted that these remarks provided useful guidance in assessing the amount of a pecuniary penalty in the present case.

Comcare accepted that the Commonwealth did not consciously or deliberately disregard the safety of cadets. There was no conscious decision to flout the law. Mr Rozen said that in Trooper Lawrence 163 FCR 2007 Madgwick J held that, absent such features, a case could not fall within the worst category. Mr Rozen, however, contested this view and argued that the absence of such features did not remove the case from the worst category.

In Trooper Lawrence 163 FCR 2007 Madgwick J said at [125]: 
 I cannot impose the maximum penalty for the reason suggested by Mr Maurice QC for the respondent, namely that there was no conscious decision to flout the law, this is not quite in the worst class of case. The seriousness of the breaches of the law mean, however, that the case is close to being in the worst class. There were systemic failures of the most serious kinds.

His Honour was referring to the circumstances of the particular case before him. I doubt that he was seeking to lay down a general principle concerning the operation of the section. Such a reading would not sit comfortably with the approach of his Honour expressed in [116] [117]. There His Honour emphasised that the overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all the circumstances. It is possible to imagine cases of the extreme end of seriousness, perhaps involving multiple fatalities, where the maximum penalty would be ordered even though there was no deliberate flouting of the law.

Then Mr Livermore referred to two Victorian Court of Appeal cases in addition to reference to the guidance provided by Madgwick J in Trooper Lawrence [2007] FCA 662 ; 163 FCR 207. These references were designed to throw some light on the analysis of the facts in the present case. However, the width of the factual enquiry in each particular case makes comparison with the facts of other cases of rather limited assistance. Each case must be assessed on its own facts. With that reservation in mind, I deal first with Director of Public Prosecutions v Yarra Valley Water Limited (2006) 159 IR 395 ; [2006] VSCA 279. In that case an employee was killed when the endplate blew off a stretch of pipe and struck him. The pipe was being pressure tested by a contractor. The contract required the testing to be done with water which was the recognised method. Instead, the test was conducted with air, thereby causing the accident. Nettle JA said at [3], [4] and [6]: 
 3. First, this case results from a tragedy. The victim of the offence lost his life in the course of his work through no fault of his own. That could have been avoided if the respondents had known more about the techniques employed in their operations. It is because of their failure to know and to take appropriate action that they fall to be punished. 

 Secondly, this case is a long way from Amcor , to which King, A.J.A. refers in her reasons; for there was here no attempt to cut corners for the sake of supposed economies or any calculated disregard of the safety of men. To the contrary, and despite the fact of the offending, the evidence bespeaks two organisations committed to the safety of their workforce and whose modus operandi was to do and pay for what they understood to be necessary to achieve it. The tragedy here came about because of a lack of knowledge and ultimately human error. 
 
 ... 

 
 6. No one denies that the nature and gravity of these offences was serious and therefore that they warranted substantial penalties. General deterrence is the pre-eminent sentencing consideration in matters of this kind and therefore any contravention of s 21 of the Occupation Health and Safety Act 1985 which results in death or serious injury is liable to be visited with heavy penalties. But for the reasons essayed by King, A.J.A. in her judgment, the level of culpability in this case was not high and it is apparent from the improvements made to the respondents' systems since the offences were committed that there is no need for specific deterrence. It should also be understood that both respondents were without any prior convictions and according to the evidence each had a well deserved reputation for safety in the workplace.

<text>Subject to the overriding caution expressed by Flick J in Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd (2008) 178 IR 200 ; [2008] FCA 1987 at [38] in the passage which follows, these statements reflect the proper approach to assessing penalty: 
 Care must be taken to ensure that any listing of potentially relevant considerations do not themselves become an impermissible substitute for considering the terms of the legislation in issue or an unnecessary constraint upon a discretion conferred in otherwise unconfined terms. 

 The Submissions of Comcare

Mr Rozen, who appeared as counsel for Comcare, submitted that the contraventions in this case were in the worst category.

He argued that the risk of a cadet suffering an allergic reaction to peanuts contained in a ration pack was both foreseeable and foreseen. This was, he argued, a significant aggravating factor. The Australian National Audit Office report in 1996 drew attention to the risk of ADF personnel suffering allergic reactions as a result of lack of awareness of the ingredients in the ration packs. The report recommended: 
 ... that Army needs to provide greater assurance that personnel are aware of the contents of ration packs prior to issue so that individuals can make alternative arrangements where medical circumstances warrant. Army could also investigate the development of alternative components to allow use by personnel with medical conditions that preclude consumption of current components. 

 
It seems from an affidavit sworn on 5 June 2009 by Alfred John Purvis, Director, Health System Program Office, Defence Material Organisation, that the ADF responded to this report by including the ingredients list in ration packs from 1997. However, there was no warning of the dangers of food allergy on the ration packs, and no indication of the ingredients on the beef satay pouch in the ration packs provided to Nathan and Nivae Anandaganeshan and Gene van den Broek.

Then, Mr Rozen contended that the grave consequences, particularly Nathan's death, but also the exposure of Nivae Anandaganeshan and Gene van den Broek to the danger of death, pointed to the seriousness of the risk to safety that arose from the contravention of s 16(1).

Next, it was contended that the threat to safety in this case arose from a systemic failure rather than from the inadvertence of the victim or a momentary lapse of supervision. Here, parents were required to advise the camp organisers of any medical conditions of the cadets. The cadets were not permitted to bring their own food on the camp. The medical details were collated but the list was not given to those responsible for distributing food to the cadets. There was thus a failure to have a system whereby the medical details relating to food allergies were available to those distributing the ration packs, and no sufficient attention was given to the potential risk to cadets with food allergies.</text>

<text>Comcare also relied on the following passage from Workcover Authority of New South Wales v Profab Industries Pty Ltd (2000) 49 NSWLR 700 at 714 (quoting with approval from Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 464): 
 [T]he primary factor to look at in relation to the penalty to be imposed is the objective seriousness of the offence. Particularly in cases involving a serious breach of the OH &amp; S Act, subjective factors, such as a plea of guilty, co-operation with the investigation and subsequent measures taken to improve safety, must play a subsidiary role in determination of penalty to the gravity of the offence itself.

 [original emphasis, footnotes omitted]

In Amcor 11 VR 557, a worker was killed when drawn into an unguarded machine used in a paper manufacturing operation. There had been a number of injuries suffered by workers in the past and reports highlighting the potential danger of the machine. The risk of injury was obvious. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against sentence and imposed a penalty of $180,000 for each of two counts of the Victorian statutory provision equivalent to s 16(1) of the Act. Consideration

Neither of the parties disputes that the death of Nathan involved a serious contravention of the Act.

There are several features which identify the contravention as particularly serious. Nathan was 13 years old. It was his first cadet camp. He was possibly the youngest boy on the camp. The breach of duty in this case involved the failure to take care of a child. The respondent had a special responsibility given Nathan's youth to ensure that his safety was protected.

Further, the danger of harm to people suffering food allergy was made known to the ADF by the 1996 Australian National Audit Office report. And, in the year prior to the camp there was renewed attention to the dangers of food allergy in schools. The State government working party on which the Association of Independent Schools of Victoria was represented had formulated its guidelines by the end of 2006. I infer from the change in the Scotch College medical form for use in the 2007 enrolment that the school was aware of the peril of anaphylaxis to people suffering food allergy. And I infer from the establishment of the working party and distribution of the Guidelines that food allergy in schools was a matter of general community concern at the time of Nathan's death.

Then, the Scotch College Cadet Unit notified parents that cadets were not expected to provide their own food. The Unit required medical information and Nathan's parents provided that information. Despite this, the Commonwealth supplied ration packs with food containing peanut and failed to take the simple precaution of having the medical details available when the ration packs were distributed. That would have allowed those supervising the distribution to ensure that boys suffering food allergy did not receive ration packs containing peanut.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2003/109.html</AustLII>
<text>In the case of victims of criminal acts, legislation now provides for courts to hear their voices through victim impact statements: for example see Div 1A of Pt 6 of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic). That legislation broadened the type of evidence which a court could consider in the course of sentencing in criminal cases: R v Dowlan [1998] 1 VR 123 at 138-9 per Charles JA. But even at common law a criminal court was entitled to take into account the impact on a victim in order to assess the severity of criminal conduct: R v Medini [2002] VSC 12 at [45] . In Director of Public Prosecutions v DJK [2003] VSCA 109 ( DJK ) Vincent JA explained the value of victim impact statements in a way which is equally applicable to evidence given by those affected by the failure of employers to comply with their occupational health and safety obligations. He said at [17] - [18] that such statements: ... constitute a reminder of what might be described as the human impact of crime. They draw to the attention of the judge who would of necessity have to consider the possible and probable consequences of criminal behaviour, not only its significance to society in general but the actual effect of a specific crime upon those who have been intimately affected by it. The statements provide an opportunity for those whose lives are often tragically altered by criminal behaviour to draw to the court's attention the damage and sense of anguish which has been created and which can often be of a very long duration. For practical purposes, they may provide the only such opportunity. Obviously the contents of the statement must be approached with care and understanding. It is not to be expected that victims will be familiar with or even attribute significance to the many considerations to which a sentencing judge must have regard in the determination of a just sentence in the particular case. Nor would it normally be reasonable or practicable for a sentencing judge to explore the accuracy of the assertions made. Nevertheless, there has been an increasing level of appreciation by the courts of the value of victim impact statements. In my view they play an important role with respect to an aspect of the criminal law to which reference is not often made. They play their part in achieving what might be termed social and individual rehabilitation. Rehabilitation, in this sense, is not perceived from the perspective of the offender, but from that of those persons who have sustained loss and damage by reason of the commission of an offence.
 ... It seems to me that the process of social and personal recovery which we attempt to achieve in order to ameliorate the consequences of a crime can be impeded or facilitated by the response of the courts. The imposition of a sentence often constitutes both a practical and ritual completion of a protracted painful period. It signifies the recognition by society of the nature and significance of the wrong that has been done to affected members, the assertion of its values and the public attribution of responsibility for the wrongdoing to the perpetrator. If the balancing of values and considerations represented by the sentence which, of course, must include those factors which militate in favour of mitigation of penalty, is capable of being perceived by a reasonably objective member of the community as just, the process of recovery is more likely to be assisted. If not, there will almost certainly be created a sense of injustice in the community generally that damages the respect in which our criminal justice system is held and which may never be removed. Indeed, from the victim's perspective, an apparent failure of the system to recognize the real significance of what has occurred in the life of that person as a consequence of the commission of the crime may well aggravate the situation.

The evidence of Mr and Mrs Francis is a good example of the purpose of such evidence as explained by Vincent JA in DJK [2003] VSCA 109. The extent to which their evidence is directly relied upon in the sentencing process is described later in these reasons. Evidence concerning the state of knowledge in the community about peanut allergy

The second issue on which the Court sought further assistance from Comcare was the state of knowledge in March 2007 about peanut allergy in the community generally and in the school community in particular. Initially the only prior knowledge of peanut allergy on which Comcare relied against the Commonwealth was the Australian National Audit Office Report in 1996 which was in limited in its terms and will be discussed later. But general knowledge suggested that peanut allergy awareness was a very live issue in the school community by March 2007. Comcare responded to the Court's request by filing an affidavit sworn on 11 May 2009 by Dr Jo Ann Douglass. Dr Douglass is a specialist physician and Head of the Department of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Service at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. She was a member of the Allergy and Anaphylaxis Working Party established in 2006 by the Victorian Department of Health Services. The Working Party was chaired by Dr Robert Hall, the Chief Health Officer for Victoria, and included paediatric allergy physicians, representatives of general practitioners, consumer advocacy groups, representatives of the Office for Children and the Department of Education and Training. It held its first meeting on 13 September 2006. The working party developed guidelines which were published in November 2006 by the Office of School Education and entitled "Anaphylaxis Guidelines: A resource for managing severe allergies in Victorian Government schools" (the Guidelines). The document acknowledges the contributions of various bodies including the Association of Independent Schools of Victoria. The Guidelines address how anaphylaxis can be prevented as follows: 
 The key to prevention of anaphylaxis in schools is knowledge of those students who are at risk, awareness of triggers (allergens) and prevention of exposure to these. 

 
 Schools need to work with parents and students to ensure that certain foods or items are kept away from the student while at school.

The Guidelines then outline a number of prevention strategies for school camps and remote settings as follows:</text>

But even at common law a criminal court was entitled to take into account the impact on a victim in order to assess the severity of criminal conduct: R v Medini [2002] VSC 12 at [45] . In Director of Public Prosecutions v DJK [2003] VSCA 109 ( DJK ) Vincent JA explained the value of victim impact statements in a way which is equally applicable to evidence given by those affected by the failure of employers to comply with their occupational health and safety obligations. He said at [17] - [18] that such statements: ... constitute a reminder of what might be described as the human impact of crime. They draw to the attention of the judge who would of necessity have to consider the possible and probable consequences of criminal behaviour, not only its significance to society in general but the actual effect of a specific crime upon those who have been intimately affected by it. The statements provide an opportunity for those whose lives are often tragically altered by criminal behaviour to draw to the court's attention the damage and sense of anguish which has been created and which can often be of a very long duration. For practical purposes, they may provide the only such opportunity. Obviously the contents of the statement must be approached with care and understanding. It is not to be expected that victims will be familiar with or even attribute significance to the many considerations to which a sentencing judge must have regard in the determination of a just sentence in the particular case. Nor would it normally be reasonable or practicable for a sentencing judge to explore the accuracy of the assertions made. Nevertheless, there has been an increasing level of appreciation by the courts of the value of victim impact statements. In my view they play an important role with respect to an aspect of the criminal law to which reference is not often made. They play their part in achieving what might be termed social and individual rehabilitation. Rehabilitation, in this sense, is not perceived from the perspective of the offender, but from that of those persons who have sustained loss and damage by reason of the commission of an offence.
 ... It seems to me that the process of social and personal recovery which we attempt to achieve in order to ameliorate the consequences of a crime can be impeded or facilitated by the response of the courts. The imposition of a sentence often constitutes both a practical and ritual completion of a protracted painful period. It signifies the recognition by society of the nature and significance of the wrong that has been done to affected members, the assertion of its values and the public attribution of responsibility for the wrongdoing to the perpetrator. If the balancing of values and considerations represented by the sentence which, of course, must include those factors which militate in favour of mitigation of penalty, is capable of being perceived by a reasonably objective member of the community as just, the process of recovery is more likely to be assisted. If not, there will almost certainly be created a sense of injustice in the community generally that damages the respect in which our criminal justice system is held and which may never be removed. Indeed, from the victim's perspective, an apparent failure of the system to recognize the real significance of what has occurred in the life of that person as a consequence of the commission of the crime may well aggravate the situation.</text>

<text>In the criminal law it is established that a maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed. In Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; [1988] HCA 14 , Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
 That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. 

 
In R v Propsting [2009] VSCA 45 , Vincent JA said at [15]:
 
 There is a stage at which conduct becomes so egregious that it must be regarded as being of a kind attracting the imposition of a very substantial, if not the maximum, penalty for the commission of the offence involved regardless of whether a more serious example could be imagined.</text>

<tocase>Workcover Authority of New South Wales v Profab Industries Pty Ltd (2000) 49 NSWLR 700</tocase>
<text>Comcare also relied on the following passage from Workcover Authority of New South Wales v Profab Industries Pty Ltd (2000) 49 NSWLR 700 at 714 (quoting with approval from Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 464): 
 [T]he primary factor to look at in relation to the penalty to be imposed is the objective seriousness of the offence. Particularly in cases involving a serious breach of the OH &amp; S Act, subjective factors, such as a plea of guilty, co-operation with the investigation and subsequent measures taken to improve safety, must play a subsidiary role in determination of penalty to the gravity of the offence itself.
