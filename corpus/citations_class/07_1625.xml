<tocase>Lee v Wilson and Mackinnon [1934] HCA 60 ; (1934) 51 CLR 276</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1934/60.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents have admitted that the third respondent published the first page of the Customer Facsimile and that the second respondent published a document resembling the first page of the attachment. The third respondent was the author of the first page of the 13 September facsimile and the second respondent was the author of the attachment, which he wrote at the request of the third respondent. There was no evidence to prove that the attachment had been written for any purpose other than its transmission to the addressee named upon it. 

Insofar as the applicants seek relief for defamation in respect of the publication of the 13 September facsimile it is appropriate to have regard to what Dixon J, as his Honour then was, said in Lee v Wilson and Mackinnon [1934] HCA 60 ; (1934) 51 CLR 276 at 287-8, namely:
 
 'It is the publication, not the composition of a libel, which is the actionable wrong. Often the person sued for publishing is not the writer. The injury done by a libel arises from the effect produced upon its readers. These considerations naturally led to a rigorous application to libels of the rule that the meaning of a document should be determined independently of the actual intention which the writer entertained. The acceptance of a criterion of liability which adopted, not the intention actuating the writer, but the understanding produced in the reader, was aided by the rule, which can be traced back to an early time, that for the interpretation of a libel evidence could be received of particular circumstances affecting its meaning, and of the actual interpretation which persons conversant with those circumstances affixed to it.'

At the time when the 13 September facsimile was transmitted the third respondent was the sole director of the first respondent.

As at 13 September 2005 no companies had been registered bearing the names 'Nielsen &amp; Moller Auto glass Australia Pty Ltd' or 'Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass International &amp; Australia Pty Ltd'. However, Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass Pty Limited ACN 064 101 873, which was registered on 28 March 1994, was in existence on that date. Prior to October 2001, it apparently had a different name. As at 14 August 2006 Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass Pty Limited had an issued capital of two shares, both of which were owned by the third respondent, who was also its sole director and secretary. 

On 6 September 2003 a letter was sent by the third respondent on a letterhead suggesting that the company with the Australian Business Number 79 064 101 873 then had the name 'Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass International Pty Ltd'. Its address was shown as the third respondent's then home address. 
 
On 18 February 2004 the third respondent signed a facsimile message as 'Managing Director/Proprietor' of 'Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass International Pty Ltd' on a facsimile form giving the Australian Business Number 79 064 101 873 as its ABN. 
 
On 11 May 2004 the third respondent signed a letter on the letterhead of 'Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass International Pty Ltd' showing as its address '8 10 Durkin Place Peakhurst NSW 2210 Sydney Australia' and giving the Australian Business Number of Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass Pty Limited as its ABN. Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass International Pty Ltd may have been the then name of Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass Pty Limited, but there is insufficient evidence to enable such a conclusion to be drawn.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1928/47.html</AustLII>
<text>I am further satisfied that the attachment to the facsimile was itself forwarded by facsimile from the second respondent to the first respondent at about 1.45 pm on 13 September 2005, whereupon it was added by the third respondent to the facsimile cover sheet and then transmitted by him as a three page document, on behalf of the first respondent. The 13 September facsimile was not published by the second respondent (see [5] above and [15]-[16] below; see also Webb v Bloch [1928] HCA 47 ; (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363-5 per Isaacs J).

The applicants' case is that more than 30 copies of the facsimile directed to 'NM Customers' were transmitted to various persons in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory on or about 13 September 2005.

The second publication took the form of a three page letter (not to be confused with the two page attachment to the 13 September facsimile) to 'Mr Scott Eldridge, Regional Coordinator, Australian Tax Office' from the second respondent bearing date 13 September 2005 ('the ATO letter'). A photocopy of a copy of this letter has become Exhibit C in the proceedings. It is acknowledged by the applicants that the manuscript letter 'C' was not on the copy from which the photocopy was made nor were the words 'SECOND SCHEDULE' or the paragraph numbers appearing in square brackets which have been added by the applicants in the left hand margin for ease of identification. The second respondent has admitted hand delivering the original of the ATO letter to the Hurstville branch of the Australian Tax Office on or about 13 September 2005. The third respondent says that the second respondent did so at his request.</text>

<tocase>Sim v Stretch (1936) 52 TLR 669</tocase>
<text>Insofar as it is suggested that the publications conveyed imputations which were defamatory of the applicants or any of them the test to be applied in determining the question of defamatory meaning is that enunciated by Lord Atkin in Sim v Stretch (1936) 52 TLR 669 at 671, namely, would the words tend to lower the applicants in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?

In Sim v Stretch there had been a quarrel between neighbours which concerned the vicissitudes of a domestic servant whose fortune it was to be employed at successive times by both the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant had dictated to the post office at Maidenhead a telegram reading 'Stretch, The Twigs, Cookham Dean. Edith has resumed her service with us to-day. Please send her possessions and the money you borrowed, also her wages, to Old Barton. Sim'. 

The Statement of Claim in that case, after alleging publication of the words of the telegram to the officials of the post office whose duty it was to transmit and deal with the telegram, alleged in paragraph 7: 
 
 'By the said words the defendant meant and was understood to mean that the plaintiff [Stretch] was in pecuniary difficulties, that by reason thereof he had been compelled to borrow and had in fact borrowed money from the said housemaid, that he had failed to pay the said housemaid her wages, and that he was a person to whom no one ought to give any credit'. 


 
At the close of the plaintiff's case counsel for the defendant submitted that the words of the telegram were incapable either of the meaning alleged in the innuendo or of any defamatory meaning.

Lord Atkin proceeded to say at 671: 
 
 '... The learned Judge rejected the submission ... It appears to me that the alleged innuendo is fantastic, and that the words used are in their ordinary meaning incapable of being understood by reasonable persons as conveying an imputation on the plaintiff's financial credit. It was, in my opinion, the duty of the Judge so to have held, and to have withdrawn the count alleging the innuendo from the jury. ... 
 
 ... Judges and text-book writers alike have found difficulty in defining with precision the word "defamatory". The conventional phrase exposing the plaintiff to hatred, ridicule, or contempt is probably too narrow. The question is complicated by having to consider the person, or class of persons, whose reaction to the publication is the test of the wrongful character of the words used. I do not intend to ask your Lordships to lay down a formal definition, but after collating the opinions of many authorities I propose, in the present case, the test: Would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally? Assuming such to be the test of whether words are defamatory or not, there is no dispute as to the relative function of Judge and jury, of law and fact. It is well settled that the Judge must decide whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning. That is a question of law; is there evidence of a tort? If they are capable, then the jury is to decide whether they are in fact defamatory. 
 
 In the present case it is material to notice that there is no evidence that the words were published to anyone who had any knowledge at all of any of the facts ... There is no direct evidence that they were published to anyone who had ever heard of the plaintiff. The post office officials at Maidenhead would not be presumed to know him, and we are left without any information as to the officials at Cookham Dean. ... It might, however, be inferred that the publication of the telegram at Cookham Dean was to someone who knew the plaintiff. What would he or she learn by reading the telegram? That Edith Saville had been in the plaintiff's employment; that she had that day entered the defendant's employment; and that the former employer was requested to send on to the new place of employment the servant's possessions, together with the money due to her for money borrowed and for wages. How could perusal of that communication tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of the right-thinking peruser who knew nothing of the circumstances but what he or she derived from the telegram itself?' 


 
Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Macmillan concurred with Lord Atkin's reasons.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1386.html</AustLII>
<text>Insofar as the applicant's case relies upon the assertion that the publications were defamatory, that, in the circumstances of this case, becomes a question of fact for me as the trial judge to determine. The question as to whether the publications were capable of giving rise to the defamatory imputations pleaded has already been addressed (see National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Ltd v Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1386 ; (2006) 156 FCR 148).

In the Third Further Amended Application filed 27 October 2006 in this case the first applicant identified that its claims have arisen under ss 52 , 53 , 55A and 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the ' Trade Practices Act ') and ss 42 , 44 , 50 and 55 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) (the ' Fair Trading Act '). 

In addition, the applicants have indicated that they all claim relief for defamation under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld), the Defamation Act 1889 (Qld), the Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA), the Wrongs Act 1936 (SA), the Defamation Act 1957 (Tas), the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 (ACT) and the law of Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China.

The substantive claims made by the first applicant in the Third Further Amended Application filed 27 October 2006 included claims for orders as follows: 
 
 'On the grounds stated in the accompanying Third Further Amended Statement of Claim, the First applicant claims: 
 
 
 
 1. An order that the respondents are liable to pay damages to the First applicant: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) under S.82 of the Trade Practices Act and s.68 of the Fair Trading Act ; 
 
 (b) under S.87 of the Trade Practices Act and s.72 of the Fair Trading Act . 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. A declaration that the Respondents have engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct pleaded in the Second (sic) Further Amended Statement of Claim; 
 
 3. Orders under Section 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act and s.65 of the Fair Trading Act restraining the Respondents from engaging in the misleading and deceptive conduct pleaded in the Second (sic) Further Amended Statement of Claim;'

In respect of the claims made by all of the applicants in respect of alleged defamation the Third Further Amended Application filed 27 October 2006 contained a claim for substantive relief as follows: 
 
 'On the grounds stated in the accompanying Second (sic) Further Amended Statement of Claim, the Applicants claim: 
 
 
 
 1. An order that the Respondents are liable to pay damages to the Applicants for defamation, including aggravated and exemplary damages. 
 
 
 
 Particulars of aggravated and exemplary damages 
 
 
 
 (a) the failure of the Respondents to apologise; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the falsity of the imputations complained of and the knowledge by the Respondents of that falsity prior to publication; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the sensationalist presentation of the matters complained of; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the failure of the Respondents to make reasonable enquiries of the Applicants including but not limited to ascertaining falsity of the imputations and the failure to ascertain the likely impact upon the Applicants prior to publishing the matters complained of; 
 
 (e) the failure of the Respondents to make reasonable enquiries of persons other than the Applicants prior to publishing the matters complained of; 
 
 (f) the malice of the Respondents as particularised in the Applicants' Reply to Amended Defence and Defence to Cross Claim. 
 
 (g) the repetition of the defamatory imputations in the matters complained of in the following subsequent publications: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) letter from the Second respondent to ATO dated 4 October 2005;

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/10.html</AustLII>
<text>In the context of a motor vehicle accident in New Caledonia in which a New South Wales resident was seriously injured, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang [2002] HCA 10 ; (2002) 210 CLR 491 at 518 [69] - [70] : 
 
 'Two particular questions arise respecting the pleading of foreign law in tort actions. ... 
 
 The first question is whether it is necessary for the plaintiff to plead the foreign law in order to establish a cause of action. The answer preferred by Dicey is in the negative. In Walker v W A Pickles Pty Ltd , Hutley JA explained: 
 
 
 
 "An action of tort may be brought in New South Wales courts irrespective of where the facts founding the action may have occurred, even if they occurred in a place where there may be no law at all: see Mostyn v Fabrigas . A pleading of a cause of action in tort which did not allege that the facts occurred in any particular law district would be formally valid. On the basis that the utmost economy is enjoined by the rules, it would seem to me that pleading of a foreign element in the initiating process in a claim in tort can never be necessary ... 
 
 This approach is reinforced by the principle that foreign law, which is, except between the States and the Territories of the Commonwealth, a fact, is presumed to be the same as local law; and a fact presumed to be true does not have to be pleaded: see Supreme Court Rules , Pt 15 , r 10(a)." 
 
 
 
 On the other hand, if the defendant seeks to rely upon a foreign lex causae, then, in the ordinary way, it is for the defendant to allege and prove that law as an exculpatory fact.' 
 
 (footnotes omitted)

Gleeson CJ, McHugh J and Kirby J each found the general presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law was the same as Australian law, to be devoid of content in the case before the Court. At 343 [16] Gleeson CJ said: 
 
 '16 ... I find no assistance in a general presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law is the same as Australian law. That might be a rational and practical aid to decision-making in many cases, but, whatever its precise extent, the principle seems to me to be devoid of content in this case. ...' 
 

At 396-397 Kirby J said at [202] [204]:
 
 '202 The foregoing difficulties, presented by the record, for the ascertainment of the law and practice of China governing Art 146 GPCL, have caused a majority of this Court to invoke a supposed presumption of the common law of evidence. This is to the effect that, in a case where the content of foreign law is significant for the resolution of the issues, and such law is not proved at all or adequately, an Australian court may presume that such law is the same as Australian law. It may decide the case accordingly. 
 
 203 Like Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, I derive no assistance from this supposed presumption, at least in a case such as the present. In this case, it involves an unrealistic fiction which has only to be stated for its flaw to be revealed. A presumption that a basic rule of the substantive law of England or some other common law country, in default of proof, is the same as the law of Australia is one that might be justified in a particular case. However, the notion that the law of a country so different, with a legal system so distinct, as China is the same as that of Australia, is completely unconvincing ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 204 With all respect to the majority view, I regard it as straining even credulity to impose on an Australian court the fiction of presuming that the law of China (the place of the wrong), which is an essential element in this case, is the same as the law in Australia. Or that a written law of China would be interpreted and applied by a Chinese court in the same way as an Australian judge would do in construing a similar text.'

As I understand the relevant authorities, the general presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law is the same as Australian law is not inflexible. Where the law of the forum is governed by a statute and the law within Australia is itself lacking in uniformity, I doubt whether it could be presumed that the defamation law in China, including the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, is the same as it is in New South Wales.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/68.html</AustLII>
<text>In Tisand (Pty) Ltd v Owners of the ship MV "Cape Moreton" (Ex "Freya" ) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 219 ALR 48 the 'Cape Moreton' had been arrested by an admiralty marshal of the Court on the application of the plaintiffs in support of a claim for damage to a cargo of zircon sand said to have occurred on a voyage from South Africa to China. Freya Navigation Shipholding Ltd was said to be legally responsible, as carrier, for the damage. A Full Court comprising Ryan and Allsop JJ considered a Notice of Motion brought by Alico Marine Ltd seeking an order that the writ in rem under which the ship had been arrested be set aside. Alico Marine Ltd claimed to be the owner of the ship.

The issue before the Full Court was whether Freya was the owner of the ship at the time of the proceedings, given that it was the 'registered owner', or whether Alico was the owner, albeit in a proprietary sense. If Freya was the owner, then the arrest of the ship was warranted, as damage to the cargo had occurred while the ship was in the possession of Freya and prior to the sale of the ship to Alico. In the result the writ in rem was set aside.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/54.html</AustLII>
<text>In Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54 ; (2005) 223 CLR 331, the High Court was concerned to determine the meaning and manner of application of Article 146 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China. In that case an Australian living in China had been injured in a fall in an apartment provided for his use by an Australian company. 

Gummow and Hayne JJ in a joint judgment, Callinan J and Heydon J each concluded that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be presumed that the law of the People's Republic of China with respect to the construction of Article 146 was the same as the law in Western Australia where the case had been brought (at 372 [125], 411 [249] and 420 [275]).</text>

<tocase>Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2001/87.html</AustLII>
<text>At 80 [147]-[148] their Honours said: 
 
 '[147] The relevant choices [as to the relevant law dealing with the assignment of property in a ship] appear to be the law of the forum, the law of the country of registry as the lex situs (and not merely when the ship is on the high seas), the law of the place of the ship if in another country's territorial waters, and (on one reading of The "Nazym Khikmet" and Vostok Shipping ) the law of the domicile of the registered owner or operator. 
 
 [148] Given that no evidence of foreign law was adduced in the present case, the question of choice between those sources of law is academic. In the absence of detailed argument on the question, we do not propose to express any concluded views. ...' 


Then at 80-81 [150] they said:
 
 '[150] Since no foreign law has been proved, the issue of the operation of the so-called presumption that foreign law is the same as the law of the forum arises. ... It may be doubted whether an Australian statute in terms directed only to Australian-owned ships is properly the subject of the presumption in these circumstances. In Damberg v Damberg (2001) 52 NSWLR 492; [2001] NSWCA 87 at [118] - [147] Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) examined the authorities on the so-called presumption. That analysis reveals the difficulties of, and disparities in approach to, its application. Some authorities limit the presumption to non-statutory law. Some extend the presumption to statutes. Some, while accepting the presumption as extending to statute law, require that the statute law not be peculiar to local situations or linked to local conditions or to establishing regulatory requirements. Thus, to the extent that statute law can be seen as part of the "general law" of the law of the forum, it will form part of the presumption. See, in particular, the different approaches in Purdom v Pavey &amp; Co (1896) 26 SCR 412; Hellens v Densmore [1957] SCR 768 at 780; Gray v Kerslake [1958] SCR 3; The Ship "Mercury Bell" v Amosin (1986) 27 DLR (4th) 641 and Schnaider v Jaffe [1916] CPD 696, all referred to by Heydon JA in Damberg v Damberg.'

Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 was a case in which a material consideration was whether in relation to the avoidance or evasion of capital gains tax, German law should be presumed to be the same as Australian law. The leading judgment in the case was that of Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, with which Spigelman CJ and Sheller JA agreed. At 504 505 [112]-[119] his Honour said: 
 
 '[112] It may be assumed that German tax law in relation to capital gains rests on a statute. The trial judge was not taken to the terms of any relevant German statute. Nor was this Court. All the trial judge was invited to do was assume that German law was identical to Australian law. He was not taken to any statutory provision in Australian law. This Court was not taken to the detail of the relevant Commonwealth legislation. This Court, too, was asked to assume that German and Australian law were the same. ... 
 
 [113] The content of German law is vital from several points of view. 
 ... 
 
 [118] A common assumption of the parties was that if German law was not proved as a fact, the court had no alternative but to apply Australian law. Is that assumption sound? 
 
 [119] The proposition that where foreign law is not proved it will be presumed to be the same as the lex fori is amply supported: ... .'

Heydon JA proceeded to cite a number of authorities in support of the presumption and then embarked upon a detailed consideration of Australian, English, Canadian and South African authorities and a number of academic treatises in relation to the presumption.

His Honour concluded that it should not be assumed that German law in relation to the avoidance or evasion of capital gains tax was the same as Australian law. His Honour said at 522 [162]: 
 
 '[162] To state exhaustively when a court will not assume that the unproved provisions of foreign law are identical with those of the lex fori would be a difficult task. It is not necessary to perform it in this case. The issue in this case is whether it should be assumed that German law in relation to the avoidance or evasion of capital gains tax is the same as Australian law. In my opinion it should not. ... German law on the point must be statutory. German law is not a common law-based system. ... There is a risk that there may be special machinery and highly individual provisions in German law as there are in Australian tax law: indeed the only evidence of German law, from Mr Stiegler, suggests that it is quite different from Australian law. Taxation law cannot be assumed to be a field resting on great and broad principles likely to be part of any given legal system.'

Whilst the present matter masquerades as one brought under the Trade Practices Act , and the Fair Trading Act , thereby attracting federal jurisdiction, it has been conducted and argued, to all intents and purposes, as a defamation case. However, notwithstanding the emphasis given by the applicants to the matter as a defamation action, it is important to note that the first applicant still maintains its entitlement to injunctive relief under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act and the corresponding s 65 of the Fair Trading Act , restraining the respondents from engaging in 'the misleading and deceptive conduct pleaded in the Second (sic) Further Amended Statement of Claim'. Section 80 of the Trade Practices Act relevantly provided: 
 
 
 '80(1) Subject to subsections (1A), (1AAA) and (1B), where, on the application of ... any other person, the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a contravention of any of the following provisions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) a provision of Part ... V ...; 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) attempting to contravene such a provision; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene such a provision; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of such a provision; ... 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. 
 ...'

In their 'Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Claim' the respondents have raised a number of defamation issues not covered by matters of non-admission and denial. These include: 
 
 (a) If it be found that the matters complained of were defamatory of the applicants as alleged and conveyed any of the imputations alleged, such imputations were:
 'substantially true and: 
 
 i. related to a matter of public interest; or 
 
 ii. was published under qualified privilege', 
 
 
 in respect of publication in New South Wales. 
 
 
 (b) In relation to publication of matters complained of in States and Territories of Australia other than New South Wales: 
 'i. the matters complained of were true in substance and in fact; and 
 
 
 
 ii. further, in respect of the publication of the matters complained of in Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, such publication was made for the public benefit.' 
 


 
 (c) If it be found that the matters complained of were defamatory of the applicants and bore any of the imputations alleged, the matters complained of were:
 'published on an occasion of qualified privilege:- 
 
 i. at common law; 
 
 ii. pursuant to section 22 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW).' 


 
 (d) For a case in mitigation of damages in relation to the publication of the matters complained of the respondents relied upon:
 'i. the bad reputation of the Applicants; 
 
 ii. the truth of the Applicants' imputations; 
 
 
 
 iii. the truth of the allegations contained in the First, Second and Third matters complained of.' 
 


 
 (e) In relation to the publication of the 13 September facsimile in New South Wales, the publication of the ATO letter in New South Wales and the publication of the 15 September email in New South Wales (which did not in fact occur), the respondents, referred to as 'the defendant', have relied upon a number of contextual imputations of and concerning the applicants which they contend were published contextually to each of the applicants' imputations, each of which related to matters of public interest, were matters of substantial truth and related to matters of public interest. The respondents further contend that by reason of the substantial truth of any one or more of the relevant contextual imputations each of the imputations relied upon by the applicants did not further injure the reputation of the applicants.
 (f) In relation to the publication of the 13 September facsimile, the ATO letter and the 15 September email outside New South Wales, the respondents contended that the publications conveyed certain imputations of and concerning the applicants which were true in substance and in fact and the publication of which was for the public benefit and, by virtue of the substantial truth of them or some of them, the applicants' reputation was not further injured by the imputations for which the applicants contended.

Detailed particulars were provided in respect of the matters pleaded in the Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Claim, occupying about 10 pages of typed script.

In their Reply to Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Clam (sic), the applicants alleged that the respondents were 'actuated by express malice in the publication of the matters complained of in that they were motivated by an ulterior purpose or foreign motive'. 

Detailed particulars were provided.

Having outlined the nature of the proceedings, it is appropriate to now paint the surrounding picture in a little more detail.

The first applicant, National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 081 814 342, ABN 33 081 814 342, was registered on 2 March 1998. Its directors were Yeung Lo, who is also known as 'Maggie' (the second applicant), Hui Ouyang, who is also known as 'Harvey' (the third applicant), Carl Christian Moller (the third respondent) and Tian He. According to the second applicant, the directors at the time were also the shareholders.</text>

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>I am not satisfied that more was said on 22 August 2006 than the third respondent conceded. It is true that the third respondent did not challenge Mr Yip's account in cross-examination, but the niceties of Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 may not have been known to him as a litigant in person. That which was said could not, as I see it, be described as a 'violent verbal assault made by the Third Respondent on the Applicants' lawyers'.

Insofar as the applicants rely upon the so-called 'malice' of the second respondent 'infecting the First respondent by reason of' his being a guiding mind of the first respondent, I am unable to so conclude. The second respondent was not a guiding mind of the first respondent. He was not a director of the first respondent, nor was he a shadow director or even a shareholder.

Notwithstanding that the first applicant only entered the market for automotive replacement glass in 1998, it is clear that it rapidly progressed to become one of the major players in the market. Its ability to reach this status was undoubtedly assisted by the dishonesty of the second and third applicants, acting with the cooperation of FYG, in respect of which they were charged and convicted. As Goldring DCJ said: 
 
 '... the total amount of $263,692.16 which should have been paid [by way of customs duty and goods and services tax on imported automotive glass] was not paid [but was paid promptly after they were found out] ... 
 
 The offences ... clearly resulted from a well thought out plan which required careful execution and the co-operation of the third party, FYG in China. ... 
 
 ... the automotive glass industry in Australia is competitive ... 
 
 ... I am satisfied that the motive for the fraud was commercial ... 
 
 ... Customs fraud ... is more serious [than social security fraud] because those who commit it are usually motivated solely by commercial greed ...'</text>

<tocase>Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177</tocase>
<text>For s 52 of the Trade Practices Act to be enlivened it is sufficient that the conduct complained of, in all the circumstances, answers the statutory description, that is to say, that it is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. It is unnecessary to go further and establish that any actual or potential consumer has taken or is likely to take any positive step in consequence of being misled or deceived. That is not to say that evidence of actual misleading or deception and of steps taken in consequence thereof is not likely to be both relevant and important on the question of whether the relevant conduct in fact answers the statutory description and as to the relief, if any, which should be granted (per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ in Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 ('Taco Bell') at 199).

In Taco Bell at 200, Deane and Fitzgerald JJ emphasised that 'no conduct can mislead or deceive unless the representee labours under some erroneous assumption' (cited with approval in Campomar at [104]).

Conduct which produces or contributes to confusion or uncertainty may or may not be misleading or deceptive for the purposes of s 52. Ordinarily, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish conduct of the type described in s 52. The question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52 (per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ in Taco Bell at 201; see also Campomar at [106]).

As to whether conduct may be categorised as misleading or deceptive Deane and Fitzgerald JJ said in Taco Bell at 202: 
 
 'Irrespective of whether conduct produces or is likely to produce confusion or misconception, it cannot, for the purposes of s 52 , be categorized as misleading or deceptive unless it contains or conveys, in all the circumstances of the case, a misrepresentation. The difficulty which will commonly arise in a s 52 case is in determining whether the conduct contains or conveys, in all the circumstances, a misrepresentation and in assessing the significance to that question of evidence that one or more persons were in fact led into error. In extreme, but not necessarily infrequent, cases, it may be correct to hold that, as a matter of law, conduct said to contravene s 52 is incapable of conveying the untrue meaning alleged or any other false meaning. Such cases aside, whether or not conduct amounts to a misrepresentation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what is said and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances. In some cases, such as an express untrue representation made only to identified individuals, the process of deciding that question of fact may be direct and uncomplicated. ...'

<text>In order to determine whether there has been any contravention of s 52(1) of the Trade Practices Act it is necessary to determine whether or not the conduct complained of amounted to a representation which has led or would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct (which may include refraining from doing an act) has been directed. Where the persons to whom the conduct has been directed are members of a class, it is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of that class to determine whether a misconception is likely to arise from the conduct alleged (see the judgment of the Full Court of the High Court in Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ('Campomar') at [98]-[103]).

In Taco Bell at 200, Deane and Fitzgerald JJ emphasised that 'no conduct can mislead or deceive unless the representee labours under some erroneous assumption' (cited with approval in Campomar at [104]).

The task of the Court is to determine whether any misconceptions or deceptions alleged to arise or to be likely to arise from the conduct complained of are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the section of the community towards whom the conduct has been directed. The Court may disregard assumptions drawn by persons to whom the conduct is directed, where those assumptions or their reactions are extreme or fanciful (see Campomar at [104]-[105]).

Conduct which produces or contributes to confusion or uncertainty may or may not be misleading or deceptive for the purposes of s 52. Ordinarily, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish conduct of the type described in s 52.

The Court observed at [52] that the lack of evidence called by the applicant in that case to the effect that general practitioners relied upon the representations complained of in prescribing medication for use by their patients was not determinative of a case for an alleged contravention of s 52.

<text>In relation to the letter apparently sent by the third respondent as the Managing Director of the first respondent to: 
 
 'The Director 
 ACCC 
 Sydney' 
 

on 15 March 2006 [see paragraph 1(g)(v) of the Third Further Amended Application] it may be observed that within its five pages it included the following on pages 4 and 5 thereof:
 
 (page 4)
 '... 
 The home detention sentence did not stop MAGGIE from attending her office and continuing her business activities even though she was a convicted criminal and a disqualified Company Director. She has now resorted to issuing a Summons for Defamation on Fatuous Grounds through her Solicitors Robert Yip&amp;Co on myself and my father. Her oleaginous approach to business and propensity to approach her solicitors in order to extract herself from her illegalities has certainly cost her a large amount of money ...' 
 
 (page 5)
 '... 
 The present Predatory Pricing Tactics of NAGS and MAGGIE and CHO has had such a SERIOUS EFFECT ON THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET THAT ITS COMPETITORS ARE NOW FACED WITH CRITICAL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND UNLESS IMMEDIATE ACTION IS TAKEN THE AUSTRALIAN ARG MARKET WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY A CORRUPT CHINESE CEO AND HIS ACCOMPLICE. 
 ...' 


 
I would understand the reference to an 'oleaginous approach to business' to be to a well-oiled approach.

The letter dated 15 March 2006 concluded with an observation that it had been prepared at the third respondent's request by the second respondent. Notwithstanding his education at Sydney Grammar School, I very much doubt that the word 'oleaginous' was one which formed part of the third respondent's vocabulary. He did not present as a linguistic scholar of any note.

In relation to the applicants' reliance upon the so-called 'contemptuous conduct' of the second respondent by reason of his letter dated 9 January 2006 (referred to in paragraph 1(h) of the Third Further Amended Application see [31] above) to Robert Yip &amp; Co, the solicitors for the applicants, I have difficulty in so categorising the second respondent's conduct in sending it.

The applicants submit that in the 13 September facsimile it was represented that the first applicant conducted its business unfairly, in that it sold products at unrealistic prices that were below cost in order to gain market control. 

True it is that the 13 September facsimile bears the heading 'NAGS/FYG Background in Australia Since 1998'. However, observations about how the first applicant conducted its business are relatively confined. In the text of the cover sheet to the 13 September facsimile, the third respondent wrote:
 
 'The wholesale supply industry has become unsustainable, due to unrealistic low supply prices that are by far the lowest in the world. With Australia now selling below costs for last 6 maths (sic) all suppliers' 
 

I would observe that this statement about 'selling below cost' appears to be related to all wholesale suppliers and not simply the first applicant.
 
In the attachment to the facsimile coversheet, addressed to the Australian Tax Office, the following appears:
 
 'I [referring to the second respondent] ... would point out that NAGS at the moment has embarked on predatory pricing policy to control the Australian replacement market by selling product below cost.' 
 

I would understand the reference to 'predatory pricing policy' to be a reference to a policy under which uneconomically low prices were set. However, the objective of price-cutting will ordinarily be to take business away from competitors. If the objective is achieved, competitors will necessarily be damaged. If it is achieved to a sufficient extent, one or more of them may be eliminated. That is inherent in the competitive process. Successful competition is bound to cause damage to some competitors. It is dangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power, which may be wrongful and constitute conducting a business unfairly (see per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J in Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 ('Besser') at 420 [122]-[123]).

In discerning whether the representation alleged by the applicants was made in the 13 September facsimile it is relevant to have regard to the fact that the statement concerning a predatory pricing policy was made in the context of an assertion that there were four major wholesalers of autoglass in Australia, one only of whom was the first applicant, yet all of whom had been 'selling below costs'.

For a finding to be made that the 13 September facsimile contained a representation that the first applicant conducted its business 'unfairly' one would need to find material suggesting that the unfairness lay in the first applicant taking advantage of a substantial degree of power in the relevant market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging its competitors.

The three purposes to be served by an award of damages for defamation were identified in the joint reasons of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Carson v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited [1993] HCA 31 ; (1993) 178 CLR 44 ('Carson') at 60: 
 
 (i) consolation for the personal distress and hurt caused to the relevant applicant by the publication;
 (ii) reparation for harm done to the relevant applicant's personal and, where appropriate, professional, reputation; and 

(iii) vindication of the relevant applicant's reputation.

 
As pointed out in Carson the first two purposes are frequently considered together and constitute consolation for the wrong done to the relevant applicant.
 
Vindication looks to the relevant attitude of others (per Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2003] HCA 52 ; (2003) 216 CLR 327 ('Rogers') at [60]; see also at [35]).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/57.html</AustLII>
<text>The common law protects a defamatory statement made on an occasion where one person has a duty or interest to make the statement and the recipient of the statement has a corresponding duty or interest to receive it. Communications made on such occasions are privileged because their making promotes the welfare of society. But the privilege is qualified hence the name qualified privilege by the condition that the occasion must not be used for some purpose or motive foreign to the duty or interest that protects the making of the statement (per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Roberts v Bass [2002] HCA 57 ; (2002) 212 CLR 1 at [62] and [75]).

A purpose or motive that is foreign to the occasion and actuates the making of the statement is called express malice. The term 'express malice' is used in contrast to presumed or implied malice that at common law arises on proof of a false and defamatory statement. Proof of express malice destroys qualified privilege. Accordingly, for the purposes of that privilege, express malice is any improper motive or purpose that induces the defendant to use the occasion of qualified privilege to defame the plaintiff (per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Roberts v Bass at [75]).

In Roberts v Bass at [10] Gleeson CJ illustrated what was meant by express malice as follows: 
 
 '... if the privileged occasion is the making by A of a report to B about the character or conduct of C, in pursuance of a duty or interest, then if the dominant motive for the making of a defamatory statement in the report is a desire to injure C, that defeats the privilege. The occasion has been misused. In that context, an honest expression of opinion about C's character or conduct is the obverse of a statement made with the dominant motive of injuring C.'

Malice means a motive for, or a purpose of, defaming the plaintiff that is inconsistent with the duty or interest that protects the occasion of the publication. It is the motive or purpose for which the occasion is used that is ultimately decisive, not the defendant's belief in the truth of the matter (per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at [79]).

Improper motive in making the defamatory publication must not be confused with a defendant's ill-will, knowledge of falsity, recklessness, lack of belief in the defamatory statement, bias, prejudice or any other motive than duty or interest for making the publication. If one of these matters is proved, it usually provides a premise for inferring that the defendant was actuated by an improper motive in making the publication. Indeed, proof that the defendant knew that a defamatory statement made on an occasion of qualified privilege was untrue is ordinarily conclusive evidence that the publication was actuated by an improper motive. But, leaving aside the special case of knowledge of falsity, mere proof of the defendant's ill-will, prejudice, bias, recklessness, lack of belief in truth or improper motive is not sufficient to establish malice. The evidence or the publication must also show some ground for concluding that the ill-will, lack of belief in the truth of the publication, recklessness, bias, prejudice or other motive existed on the privileged occasion and actuated the publication (per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Roberts v Bass at [76]; see also per Kirby J at [185]).

A defamatory imputation is presumed to be false and it is for a respondent to show that it is substantially true.</text>

<text>A privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential (per Lord Atkinson in Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334; see also Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 ('Lange') at 570).</text>

<text>A privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential (per Lord Atkinson in Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334; see also Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 ('Lange') at 570).

The purpose of the law of defamation is to strike a balance between the right to reputation and freedom of speech (see Lange at [568]).

Apart from a few exceptional cases, the common law categories of qualified privilege protect only occasions where defamatory matter is published to a limited number of recipients. If a publication is made to a large audience, a claim of qualified privilege at common law is rejected unless, exceptionally, the members of the audience all have an interest in knowing the truth. Publication beyond what was reasonably sufficient for the occasion of qualified privilege is unprotected. Because privileged occasions are ordinarily occasions of limited publication more often than not occasions of publication to a single person the common law has seen honesty of purpose in the publisher as the appropriate protection for individual reputation. As long as the publisher honestly and without malice uses the occasion for the purpose for which it is given, that person escapes liability even though the publication is false and defamatory. But a test devised for situations where usually only one person receives the publication is unlikely to be appropriate when the publication is to tens of thousands, or more, of readers, listeners or viewers (see Lange at [572]).

In Lange at 573 Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ said of s 22 at 573: 
 
 'Reasonableness of conduct is the basic criterion in s 22 of the Defamation Act which gives a statutory defence of qualified privilege.'

In my opinion, the communication of the ATO letter was protected by qualified privilege.

In relation to the publication of the 13 September facsimile and the ATO letter in New South Wales it is appropriate to have regard to s 16 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which relevantly provided: 
 
 
 '16(1) Where an imputation complained of is made by the publication of any ... letter, note, ... or other thing and another imputation is made by the same publication, the latter imputation is, for the purposes of this section, contextual to the imputation complained of. 
 
 (2) It is a defence to any imputation complained of that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the imputation relates to a matter of public interest ... 
 
 (b) one or more imputations contextual to the imputation complained of: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) relate to a matter of public interest ..., and 
 
 (ii) are matters of substantial truth, and 
 
 (iii) by reason that those contextual imputations are matters of substantial truth, the imputation complained of does not further injure the reputation of the plaintiff.'</text>

 '... a libel prima facie imports a wrong, which it could not do if the alleged libellous matter were true, and therefore the onus of proving the truth thereof is cast on the defendant. ...' 


 
Later at 361 Huddleston, B said:
 
 'The allegation is that the defendant published "falsely and maliciously". The defendant in his statement of defence traverses the falsehood of the statement alleged to have been made by him, and thereby takes the onus of justifying, but this he would have without such traverse.'

In considering the truth defences which have been raised it is convenient to address the defamatory imputations referred to at [203], [211], [214], [222], [242] and [248] above together and to also consider the defamatory imputations referred to at [225], [231] and [235] together. 

It will be recalled that the defamatory imputations referred to at [203], [211] and [242] were conveyed by the publication of the 13 September facsimile and the defamatory imputations referred to at [214], [222] and [248] were conveyed by the publication of the ATO letter.
 
Each of the defamatory imputations referred to at [225], [231] and [235] were conveyed by the publication of the 15 September email.

In my opinion, the respondents have failed to establish that the imputations to the effect that the second applicant used the first applicant to launder money to China for her own personal gain and that the second and third applicants defrauded the Australian Taxation Office were matters of substantial truth within the meaning of s 15(2) of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). Similarly, in respect of the publication of the 13 September facsimile in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, the respondents have failed to establish that these imputations were true in substance and in fact.</text>

<tocase>Bryanston Finance Ltd v de Vries [1975] 1 QB 703</tocase>
<text>It seems to me that the communication by the second respondent of the ATO letter to the Australian Taxation Office at the request of the third respondent was protected by qualified privilege. Just as a communication to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission about maladministration, incompetence or possible dishonesty within a company would be protected by qualified privilege (see per Lawton LJ in Bryanston Finance Ltd v de Vries [1975] 1 QB 703 at 736) so also, in my opinion, would a communication such as the ATO letter be protected by qualified privilege, subject to the possible loss of such privilege due to malice on the part of the second or third respondents that may be proved by the applicants.

It is apparent from the terms of the ATO letter itself that the second respondent was not well disposed towards the second and third applicants. One might say that he was personally aggrieved by their conduct in relation to the affairs of the first applicant. However, I do not consider that the communication by the second applicant of the ATO letter was other than for the common convenience and welfare of society. It was not actuated by a desire to injure the second and third applicants. The occasion for the qualified privilege had not been misused by the second respondent.

I do not consider that the second respondent was actuated by malice in sending the ATO letter to the Australian Taxation Office. In my opinion the second respondent's conduct in publishing the ATO letter was reasonable in the circumstances within the meaning of s 22(1)(c) of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW).</text>

<text>In Bellino v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1995] HCA 34 ; (1996) 185 CLR 183 at 221, Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ considered that the discussion of the conduct of any person holding public office, participating in the administration of justice or public affairs, offering goods or services to the public or otherwise engaging in public conduct that invites public criticism or discussion came within the term 'subject of public interest' within the meaning of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld). 

I do not consider that imputations contextual to the imputations complained of which related to persons associated with the first applicant as a supplier of automotive glass products to the public, related to a matter of public interest.

Furthermore, even though the contextual imputations relied upon, or some of them, may have been matters of substantial truth, I consider that the imputations complained of would further injure the reputations of the second and third applicants in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally.

In my opinion the contextual imputation defences under s 16 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) fail.</text>

<tocase>Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc v Trelford (1986) 1 QB 1000</tocase>
<text>I turn now to the defences raised in paragraphs 27 29 of the Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Claim which rely upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc v Trelford (1986) 1 QB 1000 ('Polly Peck').

Polly Peck defences are not available in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. They are available in respect of publications in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

In his leading judgment in Polly Peck O'Connor LJ stated a series of relevant principles at 1020 et seq as follows: 
 
 'The first principle is that where a plaintiff chooses to complain of part of a whole publication, the jury is entitled to see and read the whole publication ... 
 ... 
 
 The second principle is that where a publication contains two distinct libels, the plaintiff can complain of one and the defendant cannot justify that libel by proving the truth of the other. The difficulty with this apparently self-evident proposition is in deciding whether the two libels are indeed distinct in the sense that the imputation defamatory of the plaintiff's character in the one is different from the other. 
 
 The third principle is that it is for the jury to decide what the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is. ... 
 
 The fourth principle is that the trial of the action should concern itself with the essential issues and the evidence relevant thereto and that public policy and the interest of the parties require that the trial should be kept strictly to the issues necessary for a fair determination of the dispute between the parties. 
 
 In this case both the newspaper articles in which the passages of which complaint is made appear consist of a mixture of fact and comment, which is only to be expected. There are two different articles, so that strictly there are two separate causes of action, but when I look at the statement of claim it is quite obvious that the imputation of which Mr Nadir complains is the same, for in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the statement of claim, ... it will be seen that the sting of the libel is that he deceived or negligently mislead shareholders, investors and members of the general public as to the operation of his business enterprises. If the action succeeds, the jury will be asked to assess a single sum by way of damages. 
 
 It is the "sting" of the libel to which the defences of justification and fair comment are directed. ... 
 ... 
 
 ... In cases where the plaintiff relies on the natural and ordinary meaning of words and pleads a false innuendo, the defendant is entitled to justify the words in any meaning that it is open to the jury to find that the words bear, and I do not see why the defendant should not plead that in their context the words are true. ... 
 
 I do not think that a plaintiff is permitted to use a blue pencil upon words published of him so as to change their meaning and then prevent the defendant from justifying the words in their unexpurgated form. ... 
 ... 
 
 I am now in a position to state my conclusions. In cases where the plaintiff selects words from a publication, pleads that in their natural and ordinary meaning the words are defamatory of him, and pleads the meanings which he asserts they bear by way of false innuendo, the defendant is entitled to look at the whole publication in order to aver that in their context the words bear a meaning different from that alleged by the plaintiff. The defendant is entitled to plead that in that meaning the words are true ... 
 
 Where a publication contains two or more separate and distinct defamatory statements, the plaintiff is entitled to select one for complaint, and the defendant is not entitled to assert the truth of the others by way of justification. 
 
 Whether a defamatory statement is separate and distinct from other defamatory statements contained in the publication is a question of fact and degree in each case. The several defamatory allegations in their context may have a common sting, in which event they are not to be regarded as separate and distinct allegations. The defendant is entitled to justify the sting, and once again it is fortuitous that what is in fact similar fact evidence is found in the publication. 
 ...'

In the present case the respondents have not endeavoured to look at the whole of the 13 September facsimile, the whole of the ATO letter and/or the whole of the 15 September email and aver that in their context the words used bear meanings different from those alleged by the applicants as constituting defamatory imputations.

It seems to me that on the facts of this case there is no scope for the operation of the Polly Peck defence in those jurisdictions where it is available.

I should add that I am by no means satisfied that paragraphs 27 29 inclusive of the Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Claim in fact raise Polly Peck defences. Certainly the facts do not fall within the Polly Peck principles.

It is convenient to summarise the findings which I have made thus far: 
 
 (a) The first applicant's claims for relief under the Trade Practices Act and/or the Fair Trading Act should be dismissed with costs (see [191] above).
 In the applicants' outline of their final submissions of 19 April 2007 it was submitted that an injunction should go restraining the respondents, their servants and agents from publishing any matter of and concerning any of the applicants that contained any of the representations pleaded by the first applicant in support of its case for relief under the Trade Practices Act and/or the Fair Trading Act . Were it appropriate to grant relief under one or other of those Acts, and in my opinion it would not be appropriate, I would not consider that the circumstances warrant injunctive relief such as has been proposed.
 (b) The first applicant is not entitled to damages for defamation (see [199] above).
 (c) By publishing the 13 September facsimile the first and third respondents conveyed a defamatory imputation of and concerning the second applicant that she used the first applicant to launder money to China for her own personal gain (see [206]-[207] above).
 (d) By publishing the 13 September facsimile the first and third respondents conveyed a defamatory imputation of and concerning the second applicant that she was a person convicted of two offences of providing false customs invoices who defrauded the Australian Taxation Office (see [212]-[213] above).
 (e) By publishing the 13 September facsimile the first and third respondents conveyed a defamatory imputation of and concerning the third applicant that he was a person convicted of two offences of providing false customs invoices who defrauded the Australian Taxation Office (see [243]-[244] above).
 (f) The second and third applicants are entitled to damages in respect of the publication of the 13 September facsimile in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (see [19]-[22] above).
 (g) By publishing the ATO letter, at the request of the third respondent, the second respondent conveyed a defamatory imputation of and concerning the second applicant in the same terms as the imputation conveyed by the 13 September facsimile and referred to at [206]-[207] above (see [217]-[218] above).
 By publishing the ATO letter, at the request of the third respondent, the second respondent conveyed defamatory imputations of and concerning the second and third applicants in the same terms as the imputations conveyed by the 13 September facsimile and referred to at [212]-[213] and [243]-[244] above (see [223]-[224] and [249]-[250] above).
 However, the publication of the ATO letter was protected by qualified privilege. In the circumstances neither the second applicant nor the third applicant has any entitlement to damages against the second respondent or the third respondent in respect of that publication (see [270] above).
 (h) By publishing the 15 September email the third respondent conveyed defamatory imputations of and concerning the second applicant that: 
 
 
 (i) she had so conducted the affairs of the first applicant as to warrant official investigation by the Australian Taxation Office into whether she had engaged in criminal conduct including taxation fraud, money laundering and predatory pricing (see [226]-[227] above);
 (ii) she was reasonably suspected of being implicated in a major taxation fraud (see [231]-[232] above); and
 (iii) she defrauded everybody that had ever worked for her (see [236]-[237] above). 
 
 
 In making these findings referable to the 15 September email I have assumed that the defamation law in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and in the remainder of the People's Republic of China is the same as it is New South Wales. However, as I said at [41]: 
 
 
 '... the general presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law is the same as Australian law is not inflexible. Where the law of the forum is governed by a statute and the law within Australia is itself lacking in uniformity, I doubt whether it could be presumed that the defamation law in China, including the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, is the same as it is in New South Wales.' 
 


 
 In the absence of evidence as to the relevant defamation law in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and in the remainder of the People's Republic of China or at least that part where Mr Zhou Jie was located at the time when he received the 15 September email, I do not consider that any award of damages should be made referable to the transmission of the 15 September email to Curie Chen and Zhou Jie. The relevant defamation law (if any) has not been proven. I would also note the findings made by me at [188]-[190] above in relation to the circumstances in which the 15 September email was transmitted to Mr Curie Chen and Mr Zhou Jie.

As indicated above the second and third applicants claim damages including aggravated and exemplary damages. Particulars in respect of the claims for aggravated and exemplary damages are set out in paragraphs (a)-(l) on the second and third pages of the Third Further Amended Application filed 27 October 2006.</text>

Vindication looks to the relevant attitude of others (per Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2003] HCA 52 ; (2003) 216 CLR 327 ('Rogers') at [60]; see also at [35]).

However, in relation to s 46A it is appropriate to bear in mind what Hayne J said in Rogers at [72]-[76] with which Gleeson CJ and Gummow J agreed at [35]: 
 
 '72 No doubt the purpose of comparing awards for defamation and awards in personal injury cases is to ensure that what Diplock LJ called "the scale of values of the duel" is not adopted. A person's reputation is not to be valued more highly than life or limb. If an award of damages for defamation is greater than the amount that would be allowed for the non-economic consequences of the most serious physical injuries with permanently disabling consequences, it may be evident that the amount awarded for defamation is manifestly excessive. In this way, the comparison which s 46A requires limits awards for defamation. What it does not do, however, is identify where, within the outer limits of proper awards, a particular case should find its proper level. It does not, for example, say that some or all forms of defamation should attract awards less than (or greater than) an award that might be made for (say) the loss of a limb. 
 
 73 Nor would it be consistent with the statutory adoption of the rule that "[d]amages for defamation shall be the damages recoverable in accordance with the common law" (s 46(2)) to understand s 46A as prescribing a particular, let alone a mathematical, relationship between the damages to be awarded for defamation and the damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards. It is of the first importance to recall the fundamental principle that the damages to be awarded for defamation must compensate for the effect of the defamation on the particular plaintiff. Likewise, it is fundamental that the damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards must compensate for the effect of the injury on the particular plaintiff. Classifying kinds of defamation and kinds of personal injury, and using that classification to assert some relationship between the damages to be awarded in these cases would deny those fundamental principles. Nothing in s 46A permits or requires it to be done. 
 
 74 In the end, what s 46A draws to attention is that damages awarded for defamation must take their proper place in the administration of justice. In particular, they must stand in a proper relationship with awards for the non-economic consequences of personal injury. The relationship which s 46A(2) identifies is not, however, some precise or mathematical relationship between particular cases of defamation and personal injury or between particular classes of such cases. To do that would compare the incomparable. Nonetheless, s 46A(2) should be understood as having two particular consequences of relevance to the present appeal. 
 
 75 First, it invites attention to the nature of the injury done by defamation compared with the consequences of physical injury. The injury done by defamation, even if serious, is often evanescent. By contrast, some personal injuries are permanent and devastatingly disabling. One of the principal purposes of an award of damages for defamation is to vindicate the wrong that was done. By contrast, damages for personal injury can compensate, but cannot right the wrong that was done. Yet, in neither defamation nor in personal injuries is there any measure by which the compensation for the non-pecuniary loss which the particular plaintiff has suffered can be assessed except what is "reasonable". 
 
 76 The second effect of s 46A(2) flows from both the reference to the "general range" of damages allowed in personal injury cases and the inclusion, within the class of personal injury cases to be considered, of cases where the damages to be allowed are regulated by statute. Treating cases where the damages allowable are capped by statute as included within the "general range" to be considered shows that those statutory limits imposed in cases of motor or workplace accident are not to be taken as being indirectly imposed as limits on the amount to be allowed in defamation. But the reference to the general range of damages does identify the highest sums awarded for the non-economic consequences of personal injury as what might be called a presumptive outer limit to awards for defamation. So much follows from the fact that rarely, if ever, will the harm done by a defamation be greater than the most serious form of physical injury which leads to permanent and serious disabilities. And if that represents the presumptive outer limit to awards for defamation, each particular award that is made must find a place within a range which is marked out in that way.'

In determining the quantum of damages in the present case one matter to be taken into account is whether the reputations of the second and third applicants suffered any material damage at all. It is also appropriate to bear in mind, as Hayne J said in Rogers , that the injury done by defamation, even if serious, is often evanescent. The injuries in this case would seem to me to be transient in nature.

On the question of the claims made by the second and third applicants for aggravated damages it is undoubtedly the case that the first and third respondents were unwilling to apologise for their conduct in publishing the defamatory matter.

Suggestions were put by senior counsel for the applicants to the third respondent that he hated the second and third applicants and that he attacked them on a racial pretext. These suggestions were denied by the third respondent and I accept his denial.</text>

<text>In Random House Australia Pty Ltd v Abbott [1999] FCA 1538 ; (1999) 167 ALR 224 a Full Court comprising Beaumont, Miles and Drummond JJ considered awards of damages that had been made in respect of a book entitled 'Goodbye Jerusalem: Night Thoughts of a Labor Outsider' written by Mr Bob Ellis and published by Random House Australia Pty Ltd. In that case modest amounts had been awarded by the Primary Judge by way of compensatory and aggravated damages broken down as to damages for injury to reputation, damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages. One matter which was addressed on the hearing of the appeal was the relevance of a defendant's failure to apologise in determining both ordinary compensatory damages and aggravated compensatory damages. The Court held that a failure to apologise could be taken into account on both aspects of the matter.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/419.html</AustLII>
<text>In reaching these determinations as to the amounts to be awarded by way of damages I have had regard to the principles enunciated by Beazley, Giles and Santow JJA in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 ('Marsden') at [1313] et seq.

In dealing with damage to reputation their Honours said at [1370] that, in fulfilling the purpose of reparation for harm done to, and vindication of, reputation, it is necessary to know the reputation said to have been injured. In principle, a plaintiff with a bad reputation will be entitled to lower damages than a plaintiff with a high reputation, because the injury to the reputation will be less if the reputation is already diminished.

In this regard it is important to remember that reputation is to be contrasted with character, that is, what a person is as distinct from what other people think of the person, but 'character' can properly be used in the same sense as 'reputation'.

Exemplary damages depart from the notion of compensation. They are separately assessed, and their purpose is to punish a respondent and teach a respondent that defaming an applicant does not pay. In assessing compensatory damages a jury must consider how much an applicant ought to receive whereas in assessing punitive damages a jury must consider how much a respondent ought to pay. Exemplary damages may be awarded, for example, when a newspaper respondent chooses to publish without belief in the truth of what it publishes because circulation will rise and enough money will be made to offset any damages, in the traditional words 'in contumelious disregard' of the applicant's rights (see per Beazley, Giles and Santow JJA in Marsden at [1317] and [1473]).

In my opinion, publication by the third respondent of the 13 September facsimile on behalf of the first respondent did not demonstrate a contumelious disregard of the rights of the second and third applicants. It is apparent that the third respondent had a conviction that the second and third applicants had defrauded the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the disclosure of the taxable income of the first applicant.

I do not consider the circumstances to be such as to warrant the imposition of exemplary damages in respect of publication of the 13 September facsimile in jurisdictions other than New South Wales.</text>

<tocase>Wishart v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1963) 63 SR (NSW) 745</tocase>
<text>General knowledge that an applicant has a criminal record among the section of the community in which it is claimed that a defamatory imputation has been published forms part of an applicant's general reputation, which is of necessity brought into the field of relevancy by a claim by the applicant that his or her reputation has been injured (see per Hardie J in Wishart v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1963) 63 SR (NSW) 745 at 756-7).

As I understand the Defence to Third Further Amended Statement of Claim, the first and third respondents' case in respect of mitigation of damages was directed at the relevance of harm to reputation in the context of a person with a bad reputation. In the absence of evidence as to the reputation of the second and third applicants and having regard to the notoriety that would surround their convictions for very serious customs fraud offences, the clear inference is that they were people with diminished reputations as at September 2005.

I now turn to the question of exemplary damages outside of New South Wales.</text>
