<tocase>Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434</tocase>
<text>43 First, in my opinion, to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 is an abuse of process and the pursuit of the claim for unlawful discrimination would involve a relitigation of the events of 27 March 2006. The Court has a wide jurisdiction to protect a party from an abuse of process constituted by an attempt to relitigate a case already disposed of: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392-393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. It seems clear on the authorities that a proceeding may constitute an abuse of process because it involves an attempt to relitigate a dispute already judicially determined even though none of the doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel in the strict sense or an Anshun estoppel are made out: Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 at 443 [25] ; Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [58] - [70] per French J; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 410 at 423 [37]-[39] per French J (with whom Tracey J agreed at 437 [114]); Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434 at 447 [74] per Lindgren and Tracey JJ. The claim for unlawful discrimination represents an attempt to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 and is an abuse of process. I am mindful of the fact that, as events transpired, the claim for unlawful discrimination could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding, but that does not dissuade me from reaching the conclusion that I have expressed. The fact is that it was the applicant who decided to institute the earlier proceeding the day after the relevant events, to lodge his complaint with the Commission about three weeks after the relevant events, and to wait until 14 July 2006 before advising the Court that he had lodged a complaint with the Commission.</text>

<text>25 An alternative ground for the conclusion that I should not disqualify myself from hearing the present application on the ground of apparent bias is this. The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is "whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important. The respondents' application is not one in which I was called upon to make findings as to credit or, indeed, to make any findings of fact. The applicant's allegations of fact may be accepted for the purposes of the respondents' application. The questions raised by the respondents' application are, in substance, questions of law, and, having regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question I am required to decide: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 68 ATR 19 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3.</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>32 Save and except for the alleged breaches of the deed of settlement (see the earlier judgment at [15]), all the causes of action in the present proceeding are different from those advanced in the earlier proceeding. Nevertheless, all the causes of action are based on the conduct of the second respondent acting for the first respondent on 27 March 2006 and its aftermath. The doctrine of res judicata may apply in relation to the cause of action in the present proceeding based on breaches of the deed of settlement but it does not apply to the other causes of action in the present proceeding. The doctrine of issue estoppel in the strict sense may apply to those causes of action, although it is difficult to be at all certain because of the lack of coherence in the applicant's pleadings in the present proceeding. The extended doctrine of issue estoppel as articulated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ("Anshun estoppel") certainly applies in relation to all of the other claims and there is no reason they could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding. In the circumstances, the pursuit of the other claims is an abuse of process.

33 I turn now to consider the claim for unlawful discrimination.

34 In his amended statement of claim, the applicant alleges breaches or contraventions by the respondents of ss 5 , 6 , 22 and 24 of the DD Act . Section 22(1) plainly does not apply because, on any view, the alleged discrimination is not of a type which falls within the terms of that subsection. Subsection (2) provides:
 
 
 
 It is unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate against a student on the ground of the student's disability or a disability of any of the student's associates:
 
 
 
(a) by denying the student access, or limiting the student's access, to any benefit provided by the educational authority; or (b) by expelling the student; or (c) by subjecting the student to any other detriment.</text>

<tocase>Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/188.html</AustLII>
<text>11 The applicant lodged an appeal against the order I made dismissing the proceeding but, on 4 December 2007, the Full Court of this Court dismissed the appeal and ordered that the appellant in the appeal pay the respondent's costs thereof: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188.

12 The applicant then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the orders made by the Full Court but, on 15 May 2008, that application was dismissed.

13 One other point to note about the earlier proceeding is this. Before the present proceeding was instituted, the applicant made a complaint about the respondent's conduct to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ("the Commission") (as it then was). In the course of a directions hearing in the earlier proceeding held on 14 July 2006, I fixed 17 and 18 August 2006 for the trial of the earlier proceeding. Those dates were subsequently vacated and, as I have said, the proceeding was heard on 5 and 6 October 2006. The point to be made is that at the directions hearing held on 14 July 2006, the applicant said that he had a complaint of "disability discrimination on the same fact by the University". He said that the complaint had been lodged with the Commission. He said that the first respondent had asked for an extension of time to respond. The applicant raised the possibility of the proceeding then before the Court (that is, the earlier proceeding) being delayed so that it could be dealt with at the same time as any proceeding following the applicant's complaint to the Commission. In response, counsel for the first respondent said:
 Your Honour, we sought an extension of time from the Human Rights Commission. Perhaps we ought more properly have explained to them that these proceedings were on foot because, as I understand it, that would forestall the progression of any complaint stage in the Commission, and that is their policy, that is my understanding of their policy. The matter is only at the complaint stage; no proceedings have been issued. ... ... as I understand it the complaint stage needs to be worked through the Commission and examined by the Commissioner before formal proceedings are able to be initiated. We have undertaken mediation unsuccessfully. I think that the parties are some great difference apart in terms of the legal basis of the claim, but the mediation did crystallise some of the issues and we would seek that the matter be brought to trial as expeditiously as possible because we see that the trial is the only way to resolve those matters.</text>

<text>8 The trial of the earlier proceeding was held on 5 and 6 October 2006. On 31 May 2007, I made an order that the proceeding be dismissed and I delivered reasons for judgment: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCA 816. I will refer to those reasons as the earlier judgment.

9 One point to note, and the relevance of this will become apparent, is that in the course of the earlier judgment I said (at [4]) that I found the applicant "a most unsatisfactory witness" and that I did not accept his evidence except where it accorded with other evidence which I accepted. I said that the applicant's evidence as to important events changed during the course of the proceeding, that some of his evidence was highly improbable and a good deal of his evidence was inconsistent with evidence which I accepted.</text>

<text>10 On 19 June 2007, I made an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding on an indemnity basis: Rana v University of South Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 941. I said the following (at [6]):
 In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs. Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.</text>
