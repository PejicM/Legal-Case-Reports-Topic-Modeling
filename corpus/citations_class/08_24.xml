<tocase>Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd [2003] FCA 1134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1134.html</AustLII>
<text>10 In Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd [2003] FCA 1134 Sackville J considered it appropriate to award costs against an unsuccessful applicant for an interlocutory injunction where the applicant had failed, not only on the balance of convenience ground, but also on the serious question to be tried ground.

11 Orrcon submits that it succeeded on a substantial matter involved in its interlocutory application in that it succeeded in establishing that there was a serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation that the pipe was defective. (See [42]-[49] of my previous reasons.) However, the fact is that in terms of the interlocutory relief it sought, Orrcon failed to establish a serious question to be tried and, in any event, the balance of convenience favoured the refusal of relief. In addition, my decision means that Orrcon's claim for final relief in relation to the Westpac letter of credit is otiose. In those circumstances, I think it is appropriate to order that Orrcon pay Capital Steel's costs of the application for interlocutory relief.

12 Orrcon submits that if, contrary to its primary submission, I award costs in favour of Capital Steel, then I should reflect in any such order the fact that it succeeded in establishing a serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation that the pipe was defective. Three experts who gave evidence in support of that allegation were cross-examined by counsel for Capital Steel and the issue occupied some time. I could reflect Orrcon's success on that particular matter by making different costs orders with respect to different issues, or I could reduce the costs otherwise payable to Capital Steel by Orrcon.

21 In Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd [2003] FCA 1134 , Sackville J held that the case before him came within the first and third categories. His Honour said (at [14]-[16]):
 
 In the present case, I think the application for an interlocutory injunction can fairly be regarded as a self-contained part of the proceedings. The failure of the application for an injunction effectively means that the claim for this form of relief has been finally disposed of. While it is open to AACo to pursue other relief against AMP, such as its claim for damages, the overwhelming likelihood is that the Stanbroke Shares have now been transferred to Nebo as the purchaser. Moreover, there is nothing in the proceedings to indicate that AACo intends to seek relief against Nebo in these proceedings.
 
 In addition, if AACo does pursue claims against AMP, it would seem that the litigation will take a considerable period of time to resolve. Unless an order is made for the payment of costs forthwith, AMP is unlikely, in the ordinary course of events, to recover its costs in respect of the interlocutory proceedings for a lengthy period.
 
 I think that each of these factors justifies making an order in terms of FCR, O 62 r 3(3). In my opinion, the demands of justice require that there be a departure from the general practice that an order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding should not entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings have been concluded. Accordingly, I propose to order that AACo pay AMP's costs of the interlocutory proceedings forthwith and that AMP be entitled to have its bill of costs taxed forthwith.

22 Capital Steel's success on the application for interlocutory relief means that Orrcon's claim for final relief in relation to the Westpac letter of credit is otiose. That is a significant factor in favour of the order sought by Capital Steel. Capital Steel submits that Orrcon's conduct was unreasonable in the following ways:
 
 1. The refusal, or at least failure, by Orrcon to particularise its plea of unconscionable conduct; 

2. Orrcon's failure to establish a serious question to be tried;
 
 3. The fact that the orders sought by Orrcon would have involved a substantial interference in the commercial relationship between Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank (see [108] of my previous reasons);
 4. The fact (so it is said by Capital Steel) that Orrcon has not quantified its claim against it (see [105] of my previous reasons); and
 5. The fact (so it is said by Capital Steel) that Orrcon has unlawfully refused to make payment of a separate amount due by it to Capital Steel (see [105] of my previous reasons).

23 I do not think that any of these matters constitute unreasonable conduct in the relevant sense.</text>

<tocase>Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/60.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Capital Steel submits that there is no case in which an order that costs be paid forthwith has been refused on the ground that the unsuccessful party may thereby lose a right of set off. Whether that be so or not, there is no doubt that the effect on a possible right of set off is a relevant matter, the precise weight to be placed on it is to be determined having regard to the circumstances of the case. In Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136 the Full Court of this Court said (at 145 [37]):
 
 The applicants must pay the respondents' costs. We also think this an appropriate case for an order under O 62, r 3(2) that these costs be paid forthwith. The policy behind O 62, r 3 is that, in the ordinary course of litigation, costs awarded in interlocutory proceedings need not be paid until the conclusion of the proceedings when set-offs can be made in the light of the ultimate orders for costs. There is an access to justice aspect in this. Impecunious litigants who have a meritorious claim or defence should not be forced out of court because of inability to meet interlocutory costs orders. However, applications for leave to appeal in interlocutory matters of practice and procedure stand on a different footing. There is a strong public policy against the proliferation of such applications, for the reasons given by Jordan CJ and endorsed by the High Court in [ Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170]. The applicants in the present case having failed in this application, the respondents should not have to wait for a year or more before being paid.

26 In my opinion, weighing up the relevant considerations, I do not think an order that the costs be taxed and paid forthwith should be made.

27 I turn now to consider Capital Steel's application that there be an order that the costs be taxed on an indemnity basis.</text>

<text>28 The principles by which a court proceeds in determining whether costs should be awarded on a basis other than a party and party basis are well known and I will not repeat them: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151; NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77 (" NMFM "). Various circumstances have been identified in the cases as warranting a special order. It is trite to say that the discretion is a broad one, no two cases are alike, and the categories or circumstances in which a court will make a special order are not closed.</text>

<text>20 Capital Steel referred to the decision of Barrett J in Fiduciary Limited v Morning Star Research Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 432 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 1. In that case, Barrett J identified three categories of case in which the court might order that costs be paid forthwith under Pt 52A, r 9 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) namely,
 
 1. where the decision on the application determines a separately identifiable matter or the completion of a discrete aspect; 

2. where there has been unreasonable conduct on the part of the unsuccessful party; or
 
 3. where there is likely to be a considerable lapse of time between the application and the final determination of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410</tocase>
<text>35 A person ought to have been joined under this rule if a judgment of the Court will have a direct affect on the rights and liabilities of that person. This is to be contrasted with a judgment which will have an effect which is no more than indirect or inconsequential: News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 523-525.

36 I have no doubt that having regard to the reformulated orders and the matters referred to in my previous reasons, the Commonwealth Bank fell within the terms of this rule. I did not understand Orrcon to suggest the contrary. Orrcon's submission was that the Commonwealth Bank was not required to be present at the hearing and that all submissions which were properly made in opposition to its application for interlocutory relief either were or could have been made by Capital Steel. Orrcon submits that the Commonwealth Bank provided no assistance to the Court.

37 I reject this submission. The evidence filed by the Commonwealth Bank was of considerable assistance as my previous reasons indicate, and in my opinion, it would be a counsel of perfection to say that the Commonwealth should have provided this information to Capital Steel who could have presented it on its behalf. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Bank was entitled to be at the hearing to protect its interests, particularly as the orders sought by Orrcon were reformulated as the hearing proceeded. In my opinion, it cannot be said that it was not appropriate for the Commonwealth Bank to appear and to be heard. In my opinion, it follows that an order should be made that the applicant pay the fourth respondent's costs of and incidental to the application for interlocutory relief. In view of that conclusion, it is not necessary for me to address the rival submissions made by Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank regarding Capital Steel's application for a declaration as against the Commonwealth Bank in the event that I did not order that Orrcon pay the costs of the Commonwealth Bank. In that event, Capital Steel sought a declaration that the Commonwealth Bank was not entitled to recover the costs of the application for interlocutory relief under the securities it holds from Capital Steel.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/480.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The principles by which a court proceeds in determining whether costs should be awarded on a basis other than a party and party basis are well known and I will not repeat them: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151; NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77 (" NMFM "). Various circumstances have been identified in the cases as warranting a special order. It is trite to say that the discretion is a broad one, no two cases are alike, and the categories or circumstances in which a court will make a special order are not closed.

31 Capital Steel submits that Orrcon's case was hopeless and it should have known that. In this context, I am mindful of the following observations of Lindgren J in NMFM at [72]-[73].
 
 In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397, Woodward J stated in an oft-cited passage (at 401):
 
 
 
 "I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding 'solicitor and client' or 'indemnity' costs, whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success. In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion."
 
 
 
 The expression "where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success" should not be allowed to give rise to difficulty. It might be suggested, with the benefit of hindsight, that in every case "proper advice" would be advice in accordance with the reasons for judgment delivered by the Court. Accordingly, it might be suggested in the present case that NM, properly advised, would have been advised in accordance with Reasons for Judgment (No 10). Clearly, this is not what Woodward J had in mind. On the other hand, his Honour's expression "properly advised" was intended to introduce an objective notion: it would "set the bar too high" to insist that the party have actually known that there was no chance of success. Of course, questions will arise in relation to sets of circumstances falling between the two extremes. What assumed knowledge of the facts is the party's litigious conduct to be measured against? What factual inquiries is the party "deemed" to have made? What level of legal advice is the party "assumed" to have had?
 
 I do not attempt to answer these general questions.

32 I would not put Orrcon's application in the category of a hopeless case. The application came on quickly and it was complex, both legally and factually. It has to be said that views may reasonably differ as to the precise scope of the doctrine of unconscionable conduct. I realise there is an element of impression here, but I would not characterise Orrcon's case as a hopeless one for the purposes of a special order as to costs.

33 I refuse to order that Capital Steel's costs be taxed on an indemnity basis.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1319.html</AustLII>
<text>1 Orrcon Operations Pty Ltd ("Orrcon") issued a proceeding in this Court on 13 July 2007. In its application Orrcon sought both interlocutory relief and final relief. The claim for interlocutory relief came on for hearing before me on 14, 15 and 16 August 2007. On 22 August 2007, I made an order that the application for interlocutory relief be dismissed. I delivered reasons: Orrcon Operations Pty Ltd v Capital Steel &amp; Pipe Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1319. I reserved the question of costs and these reasons deal with the question of costs.

2 Capital Steel &amp; Pipe Pty Ltd ("Capital Steel") seeks the following orders:
 
 1. That Orrcon pay its costs of the interlocutory application;
 2. That such costs be taxed and paid forthwith before the principal proceeding is concluded; and

3. That such costs be taxed on an indemnity basis. 

3 In support of its application, Capital Steel tendered an affidavit of Paul Joseph Dillon sworn on 30 August 2007. Mr Dillon is a solicitor acting on behalf of Capital Steel.</text>
