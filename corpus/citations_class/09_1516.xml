<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 94 ALR 11</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>A substantial proportion of Mr Hu's written submissions concerned the alleged failure of his Honour to identify apparently forged documents provided to Mr Hu by Ms Moser of MARA. The first point to note is that it was not the task of the Federal Magistrate to investigate whether documentation provided by MARA to Mr Hu was forged by the migration agent. In the circumstances of this case it was the task of the Federal Magistrate to consider whether there were grounds for an order of review of the decision of the respondent for any of the reasons set out in s 5 of the ADJR Act (cf comments of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 94 ALR 11 at 26).

Mr Hu's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal are, in substance, an attack on the qualifications and professional standards of his Honour in failing to identify forgeries claimed to exist by Mr Hu. In this respect this ground of appeal is completely without merit.</text>

<text>Nonetheless secondly, Mr Hu submits that the respondent failed to take into account relevant considerations in making the decision not to investigate. This is potentially a ground for an order of review in terms of s 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act. In particular I note comments of Dixon J in Avon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360: 
 
 But it is for the commissioner, not for me, to be satisfied of the state of the voting power at the end of the year of income. His decision, it is true, is not unexaminable. If he does not address himself to the question which the subsection formulates, if his conclusion is affected by some mistake of law, if he takes some extraneous reason into consideration or excludes from consideration some factor which should affect his determination, on any of these grounds his conclusion is liable to review.

<tocase>House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>First, on the basis that his Honour had discretion to order discovery in this case, no satisfactory case has been made to me warranting interference with the decision of his Honour in circumstances contemplated by Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.

Second, and in any event, Mr Hu has not established that the interests of the administration of justice would have been served by his Honour making an order allowing discovery pursuant to s 45. I accept the submission of the respondent that, in light of the fact that the first time Mr Hu raised the issue of discovery was at the hearing itself before his Honour, it would not have contributed to the "fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings" for his Honour to have ordered discovery at such a late stage.

<tocase>NAQR &amp; Anor (No. 1) v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FMCA 271</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2002/271.html</AustLII>
<text>In NAQR &amp; Anor (No. 1) v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FMCA 271 Driver FM took the view that there is a rebuttable presumption in proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court that discovery and interrogatories will not be permitted, consistent with Parliament's direction under s 33 of the Federal Magistrates Act that the Court should act informally and use streamlined procedures (at [5]). In my view this accurately represents the position in respect of s 45 of the Federal Magistrates Act .

I also consider however that s 45 of the Federal Magistrates Act vests Federal Magistrates with discretion to order discovery in the circumstances prescribed by the section.

In my view the fifth ground of appeal cannot be substantiated for two reasons.</text>
