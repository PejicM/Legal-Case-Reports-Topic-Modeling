<text>1 The respondent in the proceeding ("ANZ") seeks by motion an order that the statement of claim of the applicant ("ACCC") be struck out pursuant to Order 11, r 16(b) of the Federal Court Rules on the footing that the pleading has a tendency to cause prejudice or embarrassment as it fails to plead as required by Order 11, r 2(a) material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action said to arise under ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act "), having regard to s 45A of the Act . Thus, inconsistent with established principle, the pleading fails to define, it is said, the issues with sufficient clarity to enable the respondent to understand and have the opportunity to meet the case made against it and further, the pleading asserts conclusions unsupported by material facts. As to those principles, see: Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [1997] ATPR 41-591 at 44, 151; Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713; and Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-5.</text>

19 As to MRPL, the ACCC pleads at para 4 that MRPL was a broker and supplier of loan arrangement services to members of the public in Australia including Queensland. By para 4.5, MRPL supplied all of the loan arrangement services described within the definition of that term. By para 4.6, MRPL was not a supplier of loan products and by para 4.7, MRPL was authorised by Australian Finance Group Ltd ("AFG") to submit loan applications on behalf of customers in respect of loan products to loan providers and to supply loan arrangement services to customers in respect of those products. By para 4.8, MRPL was remunerated for its supply of loan arrangement services by commission paid by a loan provider through AFG if the customer acquired the loan product of that provider. By para 4.9, MRPL from February 2003 was accredited by ANZ through AFG to submit loan applications to ANZ for ANZ loan products and by para 4.10, in the case of ANZ loan products, MRPL was paid commission for its loan arrangement services by ANZ through AFG if its customers acquired an ANZ loan product. By para 4.11, MRPL was not an agent of ANZ.

20 As to AFG, the ACCC pleads that it was an aggregator with contracts with loan providers for its accredited member brokers to submit loan applications on behalf of customers for the loan provider's loan products (para 5.2). It contracted with loan providers to ensure member brokers complied with the loan providers' standard procedures and requirements in submitting loan applications (para 5.3). From November 2002, AFG was the aggregator through which MRPL was accredited to submit loan applications on behalf of customers for loan provider's loan products (para 5.4) and from on or about February 2003, AFG was the aggregator through which MRPL was accredited to submit applications on behalf of customers to ANZ for an ANZ loan product (para 5.5). By para 5.6, AFG was remunerated by retaining a proportion of the commission payable by the loan provider to the broker who provided loan arrangement services.

21 As to the market, the applicant pleads: 
 6. At all material times: 
 
 
 6.1 there was and is a demand, from members of the public seeking to choose and acquire loan products, for loan arrangement services in Australia or, alternatively, in Queensland; and
 
 6.2 loan arrangement services are and were supplied by, inter alia, brokers and loan providers, including ANZ
 
 7. At all material times there was a market in which:
 
 7.1 loan arrangement services were supplied to members of the public;
 
 7.2 from February 2003 [MRPL] competed with, inter alia, ANZ to supply loan arrangement services, or alternatively loan arrangement services in respect of ANZ loan products; and
 
 7.3 ANZ competed with, inter alia, [MRPL] to supply loan arrangement services, or alternatively loan arrangement services in respect of ANZ loan products.

27 First, there is a market for services described as loan arrangement services . They are services offered by a supplier to customers . A customer is a potential acquirer of both a residential home loan (a loan product ) from a provider of residential home loans, and a loan arrangement service from a supplier of that service. The content of a loan arrangement service is defined as a service supplied to such customers of assisting them in choosing a particular residential home loan offered by a provider of such loans (i.e., a residential home loan lender). However, that service, by definition (para 1) has a number of component parts. A supplier of a loan arrangement service is someone that does these things: first, advises customers as to the features of available loan products from one or more residential home loan lenders; secondly, advises a customer of the available products that best suit the customer; thirdly, assists customers to complete and lodge an application for a loan which meets the lender's requirements; fourthly, acts as a facilitator or liaison between the customer and the lender in the transaction for the acquisition of a loan; and fifthly, manages the ongoing relationship between the customer and the lender after the loan has been taken up. This definitional statement of the content of loan arrangement services offered by suppliers of such services is expressed to be inclusive of these component parts. There may be other component services making up loan arrangement services but loan arrangement services at least include these elements. MRPL is a supplier of all of these services. ANZ however is not a supplier of loan arrangement services as defined by para 1. By para 3, ANZ is said to be a provider of loan arrangement services confined to its own loan products, their features, availability, terms and conditions, particular suitability to the customer's needs and the provision of assistance in the completion and lodging of applications to ANZ that meet the requirements stipulated by ANZ for such applications and the subsequent management of the banker/customer relationship in relation to that loan.

28 Secondly, the market for loan arrangement services is characterised by demand for these services in Australia or alternatively in Queensland from members of the public seeking to acquire a separate service, i.e., the acquisition of a residential home loan.

29 Thirdly, on the supply side, loan arrangement services are provided to those on the demand side by brokers (that is, a supplier not an agent of the lender, remunerated directly by the customer or by commission from the lender should the customer take up a loan (or a combination of both)) and by ANZ , among others .</text>

<tocase>Sammy Russo Supplies Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-641</tocase>
<text>3 In the alternative, the respondent seeks an order that the applicant provide further and better particulars of various paragraphs of the statement of claim pursuant to a request made by the respondent's solicitors of the applicant's solicitors, said to be the subject of an inadequate response. As to the relationship between the "fundamental rule of pleading" that a pleading contain statements of material facts and the role of particulars, the adoption by Goldberg J in Sammy Russo Supplies Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-641 at 41, 093 (a case in which the applicant asserted contraventions of ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) and in the alternative contraventions of those sections having regard to s 45A) , of Scott J's remarks in Bruce v Odhams Press Limited (supra), remains important:
 The cardinal provision ... is that the statement of claim must state the material facts. The word "material" means necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action; and if any one "material" fact is omitted, the statement of claim is bad; it is "demurrable" in the old phraseology, and in the new is liable to be "struck out". The function of "particulars" is quite different. They are not to be used in order to fill material gaps in a demurrable statement of claim gaps which ought to have been filled by appropriate statements of the various material facts which together constitute the plaintiff's cause of action. The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading, imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant. Their function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial. Consequently in strictness particulars cannot cure a bad statement of claim. But in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between a "material fact" and a "particular" piece of information which it is reasonable to give the defendant in order to tell him the case he has to meet; hence in the nature of things there is often overlapping.

4 The essential criticism of the pleading is that it is impermissibly reductionist. It reduces a structured pleading of material facts to a series of inter-dependent definitions some of which are inclusive of particular matters and thus open-ended rather than an exhaustive statement of the relevant matters. Those definitions are then adopted as defined terms to plead contraventions of the Act . The pleading in that form fails, it is said, to isolate the essential integers of a cause of action derived from ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) and 45A of the Act and, in consequence, fails to isolate and plead material facts establishing those integers. In order to plead to the statement of claim, ANZ is required, it is said, to either deny or admit that a term has the aggregated meaning attributed to it or to deconstruct the definition, isolate its component parts and admit or deny each part and plead contrary facts. This form of pleading is said to raise three faults. First, it fails to plead facts material to the cause of action and adopts or assumes terms the content of which need to be sequentially asserted as facts as their use as a "shorthand" for a collection of elements or notions is confusing contextually in the subsequent pleading. Secondly, the definitional device obscures the case put against ANZ. Thirdly, the device inverts the obligation of the ACCC to plead its case by requiring ANZ to isolate the ACCC's case from a collection of definitional terms, restate the perceived case and plead to that case.

5 In particular, the use of this definitional device is said to obfuscate whether ANZ provides the same, similar or substitutable services as those supplied by the market participant with whom ANZ is said to have imposed an s 45A provision in relation to prices as part of a contended contract arrangement or understanding struck with that participant.</text>

<text>6 The ACCC says its pleading exhibits none of these contended failings. It says the pleading of the contravention of s 45 in reliance upon s 45A is in truth a simple and straightforward matter. It says the adoption of a definitional device does not assume any or a collection of matters but rather asserts as facts that the content of terms are comprehended by the elements of the definition. The subsequent use of those terms in the pleading, although they encapsulate more than one element, makes the contention of contravening conduct plain and clear. As to the obfuscation of the services and whether they are the same, similar or substitutable services provided in competition in a market between ANZ and the relevant participant, the ACCC says that because it relies upon ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) in conjunction with s 45A , it is simply not necessary to plead all of the various layered onion rings of contestable conduct within the relevant market. What is necessary is to plead, at the centre, whether ANZ and the relevant participant are engaged in an identified market in the provision of identified services in competition. Whether others are in competition with those participants and isolating the composition and characteristics of the outer ring of contestable substitution is neither here nor there nor relevant. Pleading the full structural elements of the market and the boundaries of substitution is thus not required in order to establish the cause of action. Such a proposition is said to be supported by the observations of Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1997) ATPR 41-570 at 43, 920 and consistent with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 ; (2004) ATPR 41-996 per Selway J at 48, 671.

42 In analogous circumstances, Heerey J in ACCC v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (supra) at 43, 921 observed in respect of the relationship between ss 45(2)(a)(ii) , 45 (2)(b)(ii) and 45A that:
 If it were established that McPhee and DFE [two providers of express freight transportation services] were offering or contemplating the offer of the same services (express freight transportation services), to the same existing or potential customer (Just Jeans or ACI Florapak) it would be open to a court to conclude that McPhee and DFE were in competition with (at least) each other in a market for the supply (at least) of such services.

43 At 43, 920, his Honour also said this:
 As long as the ACCC can establish that, in connection with the alleged arrangements or understandings, McPhee and DFE were competing in a market it is not to the point that others may have been supplying the same service in that market or that services other than express freight transportation services might have been provided, or that the geographical extent of the market might have been different from that pleaded. To illustrate the point, one might ask rhetorically what would it matter for the purposes of the present case if, after elaborate discovery and issue of many subpoenas, expensive expert evidence, and a trial lasting several weeks, if not months, it were proved that Air Road and COPE were not participants in the alleged market, that some other firms not named in para 10 were participants, or that the alleged market did not cover the whole of Australia but only Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.

44 His Honour further observed that the paragraphs of the pleading before him pleading the structural elements of the market "are prolix, unnecessary and irrelevant and raise false issues which are likely to embarrass and delay the fair trial of this proceeding".

45 With respect, his Honour's observations are undoubtedly correct in that case as there was no contest between the parties that precisely the same service was in issue involving precisely the same customers in respect of a readily identifiable market for express freight transportation services between particular geographic points. Whether the market comprised broader rings of geographic boundary or outer rings of particular participants was irrelevant to the question of whether McPhee and DFE were in competition in the identified express freight transportation market in respect of precisely the same service. However, it is plain from ACCC v McPhee that pleading material facts of the particular market in which there is competition for the relevant services between the participants to the s 45A provision of the pleaded contract, arrangement or understanding, remains fundamental. In principle therefore, having regard to the relationship between contended conduct by the parties to the provision and the market in which the conduct is said to have occurred, the pleading of material facts establishing close competition in the market might well be quite contained, as Heerey J concluded in the circumstances of the case before his Honour.</text>

<text>6 The ACCC says its pleading exhibits none of these contended failings. It says the pleading of the contravention of s 45 in reliance upon s 45A is in truth a simple and straightforward matter. It says the adoption of a definitional device does not assume any or a collection of matters but rather asserts as facts that the content of terms are comprehended by the elements of the definition.

What is necessary is to plead, at the centre, whether ANZ and the relevant participant are engaged in an identified market in the provision of identified services in competition.

Such a proposition is said to be supported by the observations of Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1997) ATPR 41-570 at 43, 920 and consistent with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 ; (2004) ATPR 41-996 per Selway J at 48, 671.

46 Similarly, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (supra) Selway J at 48, 671 noted the precise limitations in the scope of the conduct alleged in that case. The conduct concerned a contended arrangement in relation to a tender price for a specific contract to be let by the Department of Defence arising out of the tender process. The ACCC relied upon s 45A of the Act . Selway J noted:
 [It] relates only to the price of a particular contract let by the Department of Defence and particularised in the statement of claim. The competitors involved in that tender process are specified by name in the statement of claim. So too are those said to be parties to the arrangement or understanding. The price said to be fixed has not been particularised, but is either the price contained in the offer by the fifth respondent (which seems to be the case that the ACCC intends to put) or the price obtained by the Department of Defence. Plainly enough, it is not the price of services generally available in the marketplace.

47 His Honour also noted at 48, 671:
 ... If the allegation related to the effect of an agreement or understanding on the overall operation of the market then it may be necessary for the ACCC to provide quite detailed particulars of that market in order to identify the relevant effect. However, in this case the relevant anti-competitive purpose or effect is strictly limited in scope.

48 Because the conduct involved a quite specific price fixing allegation between particular parties in respect of a particular tender (and consequential contract) let by the Department of Defence in respect of the supply and acquisition of construction services, his Honour concluded that the pleading of those elements, that is, the market, the contract, the participants, the identical services in the context of that transactional arrangement, did not require any greater or more detailed pleading of the market. However, the issue was not whether the applicant was required to plead material facts going to the market for the services and competition between the participants to the contract, arrangement or understanding in respect of those services but whether the material facts pleaded by the statement of claim, in the context of the transaction in question, adequately put the respondent on notice of the case to be met. His Honour concluded that it did. Again, there was no controversy that the service in question was precisely the same service provided in an uncontroversial market for the provision of construction services and the conduct related to a single party, the Department of Defence, in respect of a particular tender transaction. With respect, his Honour was plainly correct in concluding that it was not necessary to plead the market in any broader sense.

49 In simple terms, there is no great leap of pleading faith in either of these cases that the participants to the arrangement containing the s 45A provision were in competition in the supply of the relevant service in a market.

50 The distinction between these authorities and the present case is that here, the very question in controversy, is whether there is a separate market or markets as asserted in which close competition between MRPL and ANZ takes place. The pleader can not simply say there is such a market unless that contention is made good as a logical conclusion drawing together and drawn from material facts that plead the subsistence of the contended markets and contestable participation by MRPL and ANZ in each market. That is not to say that a pedantic or prolix and detailed pleading of the boundary of the entire field of rivalry need be scoped in the pleading or that the outer boundary of contestability between all participants in the market need be framed. It is however important to start at the centre and work outwards by identifying the services which are the subject of one or more markets, the core or emblematic participants in the contended markets for those services (i.e., the core or essential suppliers of the identified services; and the class of acquirers of the service (potential residential home loan borrowers seeking the relevant related services)), the services in fact provided by MRPL and those services in fact supplied by ANZ and the material facts which demonstrate that those services are strong substitutes thus falling within a separate market. Having done so, the pleading, in principle, need do no more so far as the market is concerned. In order to make good the remaining elements of s 45A , the applicant must plead that the provision of the contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose or effect or likely effect of, put in abbreviated terms, fixing a price for the contestable supply of these services.</text>

<tocase>Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd; Re Defiance Holdings Limited [1976] 25 FLR 169</tocase>
<text>9 The pleading of material facts which establish the integers of s 45A give rise to a conclusion, for the purposes of the pleading, drawn from those facts of a contravention of s 45. Pleading material facts which establish the purpose, effect or likely effect of a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding of the kind described in s 45A makes it unnecessary to plead facts going to purpose or effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. Section 45A , if established, effects a deemed contravention of s 45 as the parliament regards arrangements between competitors in relation to prices (of the kind described by s 45A) as perverse to competition as a process, a threat to consumers and inconsistent with the object of the Act (s 2). However, an essential integer of s 45A is whether the parties (or perhaps some of them) to the contract, arrangement or understanding are in competition with each other in the supply or acquisition or proposed supply or acquisition of the identified services. Competition is a "rich" and "dynamic" process which expresses itself as "rivalrous market behaviour". Whether firms compete "is very much a matter of the structure of the market in which they operate" ( Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd; Re Defiance Holdings Limited [1976] 25 FLR 169 at 187, 188 and 189).

10 Section 45(3) provides that "competition" for the purposes of s 45A in relation to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding means "competition in any market in which a corporation that is a party to the contract, arrangement or understanding ... supplies or acquires ... services".

11 Thus, it is necessary to plead material facts which establish that the participants to the contract, arrangement or understanding embodying the s 45A provision are engaged in the supply or acquisition of the identified services in any market in Australia and secondly, that the participants are engaged in rivalry with each other in that market in those services. Rivalry however takes place within a field of transactions between buyers and sellers and the boundaries of the field of rivalry are to be determined by not only the services supplied or acquired by a participant to the contract, arrangement or understanding but also having regard to services that are substitutable for or otherwise competitive with those services (s 4E of the Act ). Section 4E of the Act simply recognises the economic orthodoxy of close competition determined by strong substitution (over the long run two years not simply transient demand or supply responses, given a sufficient price incentive) within a field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers, as the determinant of the boundaries of a market. It is not necessary to repeat the well understood passage from Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (supra) at p 190 adopted with approval by many authorities including Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 and Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374.

52 It seems to me that the pleading as presently formulated fails to clearly plead material facts which establish the market and other elements discussed in these reasons. The failure to plead those material facts can not be cured by an order for particulars ( Bruce v Odhams Press Limited (supra) [3]). Accordingly, it seems to me that the proper course is to strike out the statement of claim and give leave to deliver an amended statement of claim. That is not to say that the contentions advanced by the ACCC are inherently unsound. The contentions however must be framed by material facts going to each of the integers of the cause of action as the foundation on which the claims are to be made good. As to close competition, the Tribunal in Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (supra) said at p 190:
 If the firm were to "give less and charge more" would there be, to put the matter colloquially, much of a reaction? And if so, from whom? In the language of economics the question is this: from which products and which activities would we expect a relatively high demand or supply response to price change, i.e. a relatively cross-elasticity of demand or cross-elasticity of supply? By this pleading, the ACCC contends that MRPL supplied certain services to customers (as defined) and ANZ supplied particular services to the same customers. The pass-through by MRPL to customers of a proportion of a commission fee it received from ANZ so as to reduce the price of activities undertaken by MRPL in connection with an approved ANZ residential home loan below the establishment fee charged by ANZ (whether as part of a loan service or, as contended, a price for separate services) seemed, as pleaded, to produce put colloquially "a bit of a reaction". The reaction, as pleaded, was the withdrawal of accreditation and re-accreditation on terms which involved the price of a service provided by MRPL. Whether MRPL and ANZ are in the same market needs however to be properly pleaded.

53 I do not propose to deal in any detail with the second limb of ANZ's motion seeking, in the alternative, an order that the applicant provide further and better particulars of the statement of claim in response to a request made by ANZ's solicitors. The pleading of material facts by an amended statement of claim ought to deal with many of those matters. However, it may be helpful to say something about the general area of earlier disagreement on those matters which may or may not remain relevant having regard to a re-formulated pleading.

54 First, ANZ sought a statement of the services comprising "loan arrangement services" since the definition was inclusive rather than exhaustive. The ACCC confirmed that the scope of the services was said to be inclusive and as to any other services, the request was not a proper request for particulars. It seems to me, as I have said, that the applicant ought to identify the services comprising of the markets alleged, the services provided by MRPL and those provided by ANZ.</text>
