<tocase>Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/117.html</AustLII>
<text>28 While its burden has been the subject of controversies of recent times: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 ; it is unnecessary that I enter upon them. It is sufficient for me to note that:
 
(i) the effect of s 31A was to soften the test for a successful application for summary judgment as stated by the High Court in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 ; see Kowalski at [25]-[26]; 
 
(ii) As to what is signified by having "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding", in light of what was said in Kowalski at [29]-[30], I am content to adopt what was said by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at [43] - [45] :
 
 
 
 The concept of a party having "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding" has some similarity to the test at common law for determining whether a jury properly instructed could reach a verdict for the plaintiff. That test was authoritatively stated by the Judicial Committee in Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125 at 130 1 ; [1948] 1 ALR 85 at 87 8 ( Hocking (1947)), approving the following statement from the dissenting judgment of Latham CJ ( Hocking v Bell [1945] HCA 16 ; (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 441 2 ( Hocking (1945))): 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 If there is evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff, unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla, the judge should not direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, nor should the Full Court direct the entry of such a verdict. The principle upon which the section is based is that it is for the jury to decide all questions of fact, and therefore to determine which witnesses should be believed in case of a conflict of testimony. But there must be a real issue of fact to be decided, and if the evidence is all one way, so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, there is no function left for the jury to perform, so that the court may properly take the matter into its own hands as being a matter of law, and direct a verdict to be entered in accordance with the only evidence which is really presented in the case. [Emphasis added] 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 In a case to which s 31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. 
 
 

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking (1947), contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A.</text>

<tocase>Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1401.html</AustLII>
<text>29 Because of their present relevance, I will refer to the observations of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] where his Honour said that that judgment may be made:
 
 
 ... by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s31A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established.

30 Order 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules empowers the Court (inter alia) to order that a proceeding be dismissed if satisfied that it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.

31 The Council's grounds for summary dismissal are, as I have said, layered. The first two grounds relate to the competence of the purported s 88 application. The first ground is that Mr Wilkshire is not a "person aggrieved"; the second, that his application has not enlivened any of the grounds specified in s 88(2) which are the only grounds available for making an order under s 88(1). 
 (a) "A person aggrieved"</text>

<tocase>Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Food Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104</tocase>
<text>34 The concept of "an aggrieved person" in this context has been considered in many cases: see the discussion by Sackville J in Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Food Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 at 111-114. For present purposes it is sufficient for me to refer, as others have done, to McLelland J's comment on it in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193:
 
 
 ... the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the Register rectified, or the trade mark removed in respect of any goods, as the case may be, in the manner claimed, and thus would include any person who would be, or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his being, appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense by the Register remaining unrectified, or by the trade mark remaining unremoved in respect of any goods, as the case may be, in the manner claimed.</text>

<tocase>Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/69.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Mr Wilkshire's affidavits are replete with speculations about, and assertions and allegations of, impropriety, be it of the Delegate, the Council's witnesses, or both parties' lawyers. While accepting he may be able to point to inconsistencies in evidence relating to events long prior to the preparation of the declarations of witnesses for the Council, or to the non-production of documents created over a decade earlier, he has provided no plausible justification at all for the regularly made and, at first flush, seemingly preposterous consequential allegations of impropriety. I note in passing the standard of proof s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides for such allegations: see Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 at [123] - [139] .

42 Importantly there is nothing at all to suggest that the very specific matters which were central to his case and in particular the discrepancies in the evidence on the Council's use of its mark as between April and June 1997 were themselves material, or of any causative significance, in the Council obtaining registration of that mark. The supposedly tainted evidence had no bearing on the Delegate's decision.

43 I refer to these matters because what would be involved in allowing Mr Wilkshire to amend his application would be the articulation of an, as yet, indiscernible claim (possibly under s 62A) and a claim, moreover, which there is no reason to believe on the material before me will have any substance, legal or factual.</text>

<tocase>Re South American and Mexican Co [1895] 1 Ch 37</tocase>
<text>48 It is the case generally that the dismissal of a proceeding in this Court by consent can found res judicata and issue estoppels and attract the Anshun doctrine: see generally Maiden, "Recent steps in the evolution of res judicata , cause of action estoppel and the Anshun doctrine in Australia" (2004) 25 Australian Bar Review 130 esp at 138. As was said in Re South American and Mexican Co [1895] 1 Ch 37 at 50:
 
 
 ... a judgment by consent is intended to put a stop to litigation between the parties, just as much as is a judgment which results from the decision of the court after the matter has been fought out to the end. 
 

 
See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) [2001] FCA 1861 ; (2002) 119 FCR 1 at [1148] ; Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (ACT) [1988] HCA 21 ; (1988) 164 CLR 502 at 508. This said, there is real controversy as to the extent to which decisions on appeal in opposition proceedings (whether by consent or otherwise) can found an issue estoppel or attract the Anshun doctrine in s 88 applications given the view of the Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 at [18] that an opposition proceeding had a "quasi summary nature". The Court went on (at [18]) to say that:
 
 
 An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails. In an expungement proceeding, the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored. That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding.

That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding.

<tocase>SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/75.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The Council has sought to outflank these decisions by contending that Mr Wilkshire's proceeding can, in the circumstances, properly be characterised as an abuse of process. The power of the Court to prevent such abuses extends beyond "the strict limits" of res judicata , issue estoppel and the Anshun doctrine: SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410 at [37] - [38] . A considerable body of material was put on to support the contention that Mr Wilkshire was engaging in "unjust harassment of the Council ... with respect to the subject matter of this litigation".

50 Given the view I have already taken of the prospects of this application, I do not intend to enter upon the controversies raised above. 
 The undertakings

51 The final ground, which only came into sharp focus at the hearing of the motion, is a foreshadowed defence to Mr Wilkshire's application. It is founded on the consent undertakings noted with the consent orders. It is appropriate to reiterate their terms at this point:
 
 
 4 The applicant undertakes to the Respondent as follows: 
 

 
 
 (a) not to interfere in any way with the Respondent's application to register trade mark number 942740 (the "Respondent's mark"); and 
 

 
 
 (b) not to threaten the Respondent, any of the Respondent's licenses (whether current or future) or any other person with any form of action (including action for trade mark infringement under the Trade Marks Act 1995 , passing off, breach of section 52 or 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 or related State and Territory Fair Trading Legislation and/or a breach of copyright) in relation to the use of the Respondent's mark. This undertaking applies to existing and future use of the Respondent's mark in relation to all goods and services. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this undertaking restricts the Applicant's right to use trade mark no. 847,229 in relation to the services for which he is registered.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/138.html</AustLII>
<text>52 As I will indicate below, the undertakings are contractual in character and, no less so than the Court orders, they are binding on the parties. In construing the consent orders and the undertakings, like principles are applied and in particular, evidence of the surrounding circumstances, or context, is admissible: see Nokia Corporation v Liu [2008] FCAFC 138 at [29] - [31] .

53 I earlier noted that Mr Wilkshire's legal advisers accepted an offer of compromise made by the Council's solicitors on 9 March 2007. While there may be an outstanding question whether that compromise included a non-disclosure undertaking, there is no doubt that it included the above two undertakings. Whether or not Mr Wilkshire's advisers exceeded their authority in acting as they did is not presently relevant. There can be no doubt that, in the circumstances, they acted within their ostensible authority to compromise the action. Equally there is no doubt that Mr Wilkshire was prepared to accept the compromise in the form offered in the letter of 27 February 2007 from the Council's lawyers. It was, in substance, what is contained in the consent orders and undertakings. Both the evidence and legal principle point in one direction. Whatever grounds for complaint (if any) Mr Wilkshire has against his advisers, he was bound by the consent orders and he remains bound by his contractual undertaking.

54 The remaining question is whether, by the undertakings given, he contractually bound himself not to initiate the present proceedings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/58.html</AustLII>
<text>58 The Council contends that cl 4(b) created an estoppel by convention which barred Mr Wilkshire for instituting the present proceeding. I have some difficulty in understanding how this species of estoppel (on which see generally Handley, Estoppel by Conduct and Election , Ch 8 (2006)) in this setting assists the Council beyond the assistance which it properly can derive from the construction of the undertakings themselves in their setting. The context does provide quite clear indications as to how the language of the undertakings should be interpreted but that conclusion is arrived at by well accepted processes of interpretation. It does not in this matter seem to suggest that the parties adopted some assumption as the "conventional basis" upon which they entered into their compromise and from which Mr Wilkshire should not now be allowed to depart: Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd [1937] HCA 58 ; (1937) 59 CLR 641 at 657.</text>

<tocase>Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 234</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2009/234.html</AustLII>
<text>59 As Allsop P indicated in Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 234 at [3] :
 
 
 ... the identification of ambiguity is not a precondition for examining contextual and background material otherwise legitimate to examine in furtherance of the construction and interpretation of a written contract.

60 It is in my view quite clear that considered together with the consent orders (which, unfavourably to Mr Wilkshire, brought to an end the proceeding that was then on foot), the manifest intent of the two undertakings was to (a) secure that Mr Wilkshire would not interfere with the Council's obtaining registration of its mark (cl 4(a)); and (b) thereafter he would not interfere with the Council's use and enjoyment of its registered mark, directly or indirectly (cl 4 (b)). Likewise the manifest intent of the consent orders, when considered in the context of the undertakings, was not simply to bring to an end a proceeding of "a quasi summary nature". Put shortly, the combined effect of the orders and undertaking was that their dispute over the mark was to be at an end then and thereafter. Order 1 and Undertaking 4(a) were to secure for the Council its registered mark vis-&agrave;-vis Mr Wilkshire; Undertaking 4(b) was to secure the use and enjoyment of that registered mark undisturbed by actions, threatened or initiated, by Mr Wilkshire. In aggregate the parties' compromise agreement was more than the bare compromise on an opposition appeal. In this setting "not to threaten ... with any form of action" manifestly was intended to comprehend "the initiation" of an action. Similarly any action in relation "to the use of" the registered mark encompassed an action in relation to its use as a registered mark.

61 In its setting cl 4(b) is not in my view to be construed as some adaptation of the s 129 "threat action". Rather, it can, and should be, interpreted as I have indicated above. As such, it could be relied upon as a complete defence to the prosecution of the present application. It provides yet another basis for summary judgment against him under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act .</text>
