<tocase>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/10.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The power conferred by s 21 is a discretionary power which is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564. Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed (at 581 2):
 It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief. It is a discretionary power which "[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise." However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. Hence, declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions. The person seeking relief must have "a real interest" and relief will not be granted if the question "is purely hypothetical", if relief is "claimed in relation to circumstances that [have] not occurred and might never happen" or if "the Court's declaration will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties". (citations omitted)

22 Given the functions entrusted to Comcare by the 1991 Act, there can be no question but that Comcare has " a real interest " in securing the relief which is sought. Indeed, cl 5 to sch 2 of the 1991 Act expressly provides that either Comcare or an investigator may apply for a declaration of contravention.

23 The manner in which the Court is to inform itself as to whether or not there has been a breach of the 1991 Act is not surprisingly left unspecified. Whether or not there has been a breach may involve, in some cases, a contested and lengthy hearing. Alternatively, and as in the present proceeding, the parties may provide to the Court a statement of agreed facts and limited further evidence .</text>

<text>36 In the statutory context of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), French J (as he then was) has attempted to summarise some of these considerations: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076. When assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s 76(1) of the 1974 Act His Honour observed (at 52,152 52,153):
 The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases. These include the following: 1. The nature and extent of the contravening conduct. 2. The amount of loss or damage caused. 3. The circumstances in which the conduct took place. 4. The size of the contravening company. 5. The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market. 6. The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended. 7. Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level. 8. Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention. 9. Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 

 
These considerations have since been applied to other legislative contexts: eg, Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [51] , [2004] FCA 1317 ; 136 LGERA 89 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 at [30] ; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [24] .</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/662.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207. A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November 1994 as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise. His Honour there observed:
 [120] Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety; (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable; (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer; (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty. However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety; (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision; (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act; (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. This implies constant vigilance. Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive. In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future. This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety; (viii) regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration; (xi) the neglect of simple, well-known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury, take a matter towards the worst case category; (x) the objective seriousness of the offence, without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties. 
These considerations, it was concluded, " provide [d] useful, analogical, general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act ". His Honour noted that the maximum penalty was 2,200 penalty units, a penalty of less than $250,000. The maximum penalty would be appropriate where there had been a " conscious decision to flout the law ". A penalty of 1,800 penalty units ($198,000) was ordered. His Honour found that there had been " systemic failures of the most serious kind ": at [125].

37 These considerations may also be applied to the task of assessing the penalty to be imposed under the current legislation. To some extent the considerations set forth by Madgwick J overlap with those set forth by French J; to some extent they do not.

39 A final matter of principle should also be noted. It is inappropriate to fix a penalty simply by reference to the quantum of a penalty imposed in another case. It was thus understood to be common ground between the parties to the present proceeding that it was not appropriate to regard (in particular) the penalty of $198,000 in Comcare v Commonwealth as itself fixing a " benchmark " against which other penalties are to be determined in cases involving death. In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed (at 295):
 A hallmark of justice is equality before the law, and, other things being equal, corporations guilty of similar contraventions should incur similar penalties: Trade Practices Commission v Axive Pty Ltd [(1994) ATPR 41-368] (at 42,795). There should not be such an inequality as would suggest that the treatment meted out has not been even-handed: cf the criminal law case Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606. However, other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned. In the present case, differing circumstances, size, market power and responsibility for the contraventions, as well as other factors, complicate any attempt to compare the penalties imposed on the appellant with those imposed on the other corporations. Another form of comparison is not appropriate. The facts of the instant case should not be compared with a particular reported case in order to derive therefrom the amount of the penalty to be fixed. Cases are authorities for matters of principle; but the penalty found to be appropriate, as a matter of fact, in the circumstances of one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in the different circumstances of another case. The point was well made by Spender J in Trade Practices Commission v Annand and Thompson Pty Ltd [(1987) ATPR 40-772] (at 48,394) when he said: 
 
 "Each case must, of course, be viewed on its own facts and facts may be infinite in their variety." 
 
 It follows, as his Honour also said, that "[t]he quantum of penalties imposed in other cases can seldom be of very much direct assistance". 
A comparison of the facts in Comcare v Commonwealth and the facts in the present proceeding only serves to underline the point there being made by Burchett and Kiefell JJ (and by Spender J) -- namely that the facts and circumstances of individual cases are infinitely diverse. The quantum of any penalty to be imposed must necessarily be fixed by reference to the peculiar facts arising in each case as and when they arise.

40 In the present proceeding it is considered that an appropriate penalty is $165,000 -- that being the sum as agreed between the parties.

41 In imposing that penalty, consideration has been given to both:
 
&#8226; the agreement as between the parties; and 
 
&#8226; the facts and circumstances as set forth in the Statement of Agreed Facts and such evidence as has been relied upon.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , 98 ALD 67</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1548.html</AustLII>
<text>33 In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , 98 ALD 67 a penalty of $20,000 had been agreed between the parties and ordered by the Court. Whilst not downplaying the serious risks involved, the injuries sustained by the workers were relatively mild. Gyles J there further observed:
 [8] All things considered, I am satisfied that the pecuniary penalty proposed is appropriate. As the cases indicate, it is not so much a question of me deciding what figure I would independently propose and then seeing whether it accords with the figure proposed. A commonsense approach is to take the agreed figure and give consideration to whether it is within the range of appropriate figures. In my opinion it is. I make the orders set out in the draft order which I have initialled and placed with the papers.

34 Although the particular legislative regime which is being enforced must always remain the source whereby considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty are to be discerned, there nevertheless remain some more general considerations that inform the discretion being exercised.

35 Many other Commonwealth Acts provide for a regulator to approach this Court seeking an order for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty as a means of securing compliance with legislative provisions. A degree of learning has emerged from those authorities dealing with those other legislative provisions as to the matters to be taken into account when assessing a penalty.

42 The extent to which this Court may inform itself as to the appropriate quantification of any penalty to be imposed by reference to any agreement between the parties has been the subject of consideration in the context of other legislation: eg, Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [33] [42]. Reference was there made to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 and to the earlier decision in NW Frozen Foods . The Full Court in Mobil Oil continued on to observe:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another. (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters. (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range.

&#8226; the fact that the breach of the duty occasioned the death of Mr Lapidario;
 
&#8226; the lack of attention previously given to the training extended to supervisors and team leaders;
 
&#8226; the lack of attention previously given to the training of employees and contractors; 
 
&#8226; the fact that there was a degree of " horseplay " engaged in by Mr Lapidario himself;
 
&#8226; the steps which have been implemented since his death in an effort to ensure that the health and safety of employees is now protected; 
 
&#8226; the contrition expressed by the present Respondent; and 
 
&#8226; the fact that the Respondent has been able to reach agreement with Comcare as to those facts considered by the parties to be relevant to the penalty to be imposed, thereby not necessitating a contested hearing.

The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market. 6. The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended. 7. Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level. 8. Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention. 9. Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 

 
These considerations have since been applied to other legislative contexts: eg, Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [51] , [2004] FCA 1317 ; 136 LGERA 89 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 at [30] ; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [24] .

42 The extent to which this Court may inform itself as to the appropriate quantification of any penalty to be imposed by reference to any agreement between the parties has been the subject of consideration in the context of other legislation: eg, Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [33] [42]. Reference was there made to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 and to the earlier decision in NW Frozen Foods . The Full Court in Mobil Oil continued on to observe:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act. (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another. (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters. (v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. 
In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 at [4] , [2007] FCA 1548 ; 98 ALD 67 at 68 Gyles J referred to Mobil Oil and accepted that " that decision does provide appropriate guidance ".</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076</tocase>
<text>36 In the statutory context of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), French J (as he then was) has attempted to summarise some of these considerations: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076. When assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s 76(1) of the 1974 Act His Honour observed (at 52,152 52,153):
 The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases. These include the following: 1. The nature and extent of the contravening conduct. 2. The amount of loss or damage caused. 3. The circumstances in which the conduct took place. 4. The size of the contravening company. 5. The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market. 6. The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended. 7. Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level. 8. Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention. 9. Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 

 
These considerations have since been applied to other legislative contexts: eg, Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [51] , [2004] FCA 1317 ; 136 LGERA 89 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 at [30] ; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [24] .

37 These considerations may also be applied to the task of assessing the penalty to be imposed under the current legislation. To some extent the considerations set forth by Madgwick J overlap with those set forth by French J; to some extent they do not.</text>

<tocase>Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/14.html</AustLII>
<text>46 Consideration has also been given to:
 
&#8226; the two earlier events that took place in November 2002 and July 2003. 
 
It would be inappropriate to increase the penalty now to be imposed by reason of those two earlier contraventions of the New South Wales Act -- to do so " would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences ": Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ. But those events do assume some limited relevance. There was no explanation as to why those steps which have more recently been implemented in order to address the safety of employees working in the vicinity of forklifts were not implemented at a far earlier date. The dangers inherent in working in the vicinity of forklifts had very clearly emerged long ago.

47 It is considered that it is " appropriate " to give effect to the agreement between the parties as to penalty. Whether or not the Court would have reached the same figure is not to the point; the sum of $165,000, as agreed between the parties, is within the " permissible range ".

48 The Court declares that:
 
1. In or about March 2006 and on 25 May 2006 Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd contravened clause 2(1) of Schedule 2 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) by reason of its having breached section 16(1) of the said Act in that:
 
(a) The duties of Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd under subsection 16(1) apply not only in relation to its employees, but also, to the extent provided for in subsection 16(4), in relation to its contractors, as defined in section 9A. 
 
(b) In or about March 2006 its contractor Mr John Lapidario approached a moving forklift operated by its employee Mr Van Trot Tran and disconnected the power on that forklift.
 
(c) On another occasion in or about March 2006 Mr Lapidario, without any qualifications or training to do so, operated a moving forklift in warehouse 1 in the vicinity of Mr Tran.
 
(d) On another occasion in or about March 2006 Mr Lapidario approached an operating forklift operated at the time by Mr Tran and applied the handbrake.
 
(e) At approximately 2.45 pm on 25 May 2006 Mr Tran was operating a forklift from the driver's seat in the vicinity of the work benches and immediately to the south of the southern-most rack of shelving at the Site. In an attempt to engage in horseplay with Mr Tran, Mr Lapidario climbed onto the forklift putting his right hand on Mr Tran's head and neck, and his left hand under Mr Tran's leg. The forklift travelled in reverse and Mr Lapidario was accidentally crushed between a pole and the forklift. Mr Lapidario died at the scene of the accident.
 
2. In this regard Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd breached its duty under section 16(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) to take all reasonably practical steps to protect the health and safety at work of its employee Mr Tran and its contractor Mr Lapidario in that it:
 
(a) failed to provide adequate supervision or instruction to Mr Lapidario so as to ensure that he did not engage in the conduct set out above.
 
(b) failed to ensure that there was an adequate traffic management system in place to prevent or reduce the risk of Mr Lapidario coming into contact with a moving forklift.
 
3. The Commonwealth entity to which the conduct related is Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd.</text>
