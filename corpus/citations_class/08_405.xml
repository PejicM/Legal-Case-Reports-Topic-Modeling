<text>2 On 11 April 2007 I decided an application for security for costs by the two cross-respondents in principle and gave reasons for the decision ( People Telecom Limited v Phatchat Pty Limited [2007] FCA 536). The last substantive paragraph was as follows:
 So, in my opinion, the task at the moment is to fix an amount which would be reasonable for those steps which should be taken to meet the s 45 and s 46 case, pending receipt of the evidence, which will be led by the applicant. It is at that point that both the cross-respondents, and myself, will have a better idea as to what is required for security. I will stand the matter over for further directions to 8 May 2007 at 9.15 am. If, in the meantime, that guidance helps you work something out, so much the better.

3 The amount of $30,000 was subsequently fixed for each cross-respondent. The point has now been reached where the next tranche of security is to be considered in relation to the cross-respondent Optus. After security was ordered and provided, there was a major change in the cross-claim based upon breach of Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) the claim based upon s 46 has been abandoned, leaving a claim of breach of s 45 entirely based upon s 4D. Also, the cross-claimants' evidence has now been filed.

4 The orders for security were intended to provide security for the additional costs that would be incurred by reason of the preparation for the Pt IV cross-claim as such and that principle will govern this application, but with a rider. There are effectively three bases for the cross-claims against Optus breach of Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and interference with contractual relations. There was no particular analysis of these bases on the earlier occasion the principal focus was upon the claims against the other cross-respondent. However, applying the same reasoning, the claim for interference with contractual relations would not attract an order for security. I doubt if the same can be said of the Privacy Act claim. On the face of it, it can be seen as both discrete and offensive (in the relevant sense). However, it arises out of circumstances otherwise in issue and, apart from a possible question of law, it is not suggested that it requires factual preparation not otherwise required.</text>
