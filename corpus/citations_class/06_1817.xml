<text>12 By reason of the way I propose to proceed, those questions do not require my consideration, although I should say that my preliminary view would be that s 79 of the Judiciary Act , in the circumstances of this case, would allow there to be reliance by this Court on s 66 of the Act: Pederson v Young [1964] HCA 28 ; (1964) 110 CLR 162 at 167-8; John Robertson &amp; Co Ltd (in liq) v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 21 ; (1973) 129 CLR 65 at 80-1 and at 94-5; Northern Territory v GPAO [1999] HCA 8 ; (1998) 196 CLR 553 at 587-9, 650-1 and 607-9; Gordon v Tolcher [2006] HCA 62 at [4] .</text>

<tocase>Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3) (2005) 220 ALR 535</tocase>
<text>14 I am informed that there has been an appeal from that decision, but until that appeal is heard and determined, the order of the County Court and the application to VCAT stand as matters of which I should take cognisance. In those circumstances I need to consider, without more, whether or not this action brought by the applicant should be stayed. The principles in relation to a stay were set out, appropriately, in a number of the cases, but conveniently, the principles are set out by Mansfield J in Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3) (2005) 220 ALR 535 at [8]-[21].

15 One starts with the important proposition that it is a fundamental principle that an applicant is entitled to have his or her action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the Court subject only to the exercise of judicial discretion on proper grounds as part of the Court's inherent powers. In this particular case there is already a question of the proper legal representation of the first respondent and in addition also there are the applications of the first and second respondents to have the whole application dismissed. Necessarily, they are matters that need to be determined before the applicant can go to trial in relation to this matter. If a stay is granted obviously it will affect the process by which the first and second respondents seek to have summary judgment and those matters will be stayed as well, as the whole proceeding being stayed itself.

16 In the unusual circumstances of this case, it is my view that a stay should be granted pending the hearing and determination of the matter before VCAT and I propose to so order.



 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice MIDDLETON.
