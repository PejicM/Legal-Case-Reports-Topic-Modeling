<text>3 No point has been taken by the appellant as to the late filing of this Notice and, in light of the first respondent's attitude to the procedural defect identified in the Notice, no point of substance arises from the late filing of that Notice. As I have said, leave to appeal is required (see Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397). In order to secure leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, an applicant must show that there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the judgment below to warrant review and, further, that, if the judgment below is found to be wrong, substantial injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused.

4 I will continue to refer to the appellant as "the appellant" notwithstanding the fact that I propose to deal with the matter upon the basis that the process filed constitutes an application for leave to appeal. Ms Weston, on behalf of the first respondent, accepts that I should approach the matter on the basis that the process filed is an application for leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision and I intend to deal with the matter on that basis.

5 The appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 11 November 2007. On 4 December 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. A delegate of the first respondent refused that application on 16 January 2008. On 31 January 2008 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.

6 In the proceedings before the Tribunal the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her practice of Falun Gong. She claimed before the Tribunal that she was introduced to Falun Gong in 2000, though she later stated she had been introduced to Falun Gong in 1997 by a customer in the shop where she worked. She said that in 2007 she was practising Falun Gong at a friend's house and that the police came and arrested them. She claimed that she had been detained for five days during which time she was tortured. She said that she was released when her husband paid a large sum of money, presumably to the authorities.

7 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a credible witness. The Tribunal found that the appellant's evidence was inconsistent, implausible and confused and noted that in many instances she was not frank or forthcoming in the answers she gave.</text>
