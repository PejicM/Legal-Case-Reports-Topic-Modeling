<text>12 Nevertheless, and this is the third observation, the remedies available under s 1323 are dramatic and the court should exercise care before making any order. While it is not necessary to show that the aggrieved person in fact has a case against the relevant person in order to obtain an interim injunction, the strength of the case is important. If the investigation is in its early stages it may be enough to show a possible case against the relevant person or the person on whose behalf the relevant person holds property. If the investigation is in late stages, or has been completed, probably no order should be made (or continued) unless the evidence suggests a prime facie case of liability: see generally Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Walker (1987) 11 ACLR 884; Corporate Affairs Commission (SA) v Lone Star Exploration NL (No 2) (1988) 14 ACLR 499; Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 459, 511-512.</text>

<tocase>Corporate Affairs Commission v United International Technologies Pty Ltd (1987) 6 ACLC 637</tocase>
<text>13 The final observation concerns the "jurisdictional pre-conditions" that are imposed by s 1323. Here I am not referring simply to the three conditions referred to in s 1323(1) that were commented upon in Corporate Affairs Commission v United International Technologies Pty Ltd (1987) 6 ACLC 637, 642. I have in mind what might also be described as a "jurisdictional pre-condition" namely the requirements in paras (d) (e) and (f) that a protective order can only be made in respect of "[indebtedness]... to the relevant person or [his] associate" (para (d)), "[any] money, financial or products or other property [held] on behalf of the relevant person or [his] associate" (para (e)) and "money of the relevant person [or his associate]" (para (f)). At a final hearing of an application under s 1323 it will be necessary for ASIC to prove on the civil standard that one of these conditions exist. When an interim order is sought this is not a requirement. All the court need do is decide whether it is "desirable" that an interim order be made. And it may be desirable even if ASIC is not able to tender proof that will establish the existence of any one of the conditions. By analogy with cases on interlocutory injunctions, if ASIC can show something like a possible or prima facie case that will usually be enough.

14 Returning to the case at hand, the interim orders were made for the following reasons: As I have said, it appears not to be in dispute that some of the money paid by investors has found its way into each defendant's account. I infer from this that each defendant was either involved in the fraud or holds money on behalf of a person who was involved. The inference is more readily drawn by the fact that neither defendant has gone into evidence to explain how he came by money from the Universal or Capital Marketing Services accounts in Hong Kong. In these circumstances the investors might have good claims against each defendant, or in respect of the funds in each defendant's possession, and are entitled to a protective order to preserve those funds until the matter is more fully investigated at the trial.
