<text>The lack of compliance was not articulated with any great precision or clarity. It was said that the grounds in the amended draft notice of appeal 'are little more than a duplication of the alleged question of law'. Grounds 4(a) to 4(j) differ only from the corresponding alleged questions of law in two ways: first, the word 'whether' is omitted from the opening words so that each paragraph is no longer prefaced as a question and; second, statutory references are inserted. But as the Commissioner acknowledges in his referral to various quotations from cases such as Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [47] (Branson J); Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 523 (Ryan J); Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1908 at [19] (Gilmour J); Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154 ; (2007) 243 ALR 728 at [75] (Greenwood J); and Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 38 AAR 55 at [18] (Branson and Stone JJ), because the existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal, but must be the subject matter of the appeal itself see TNT Skypak International (Aust.) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 (Gummow J) there should be a link or symmetry between the question raised and the ground relied upon. Subject to the question raised being truly a pure question of law (see Birdseye at [18] (Branson and Stone JJ)), the applicant's articulation of the grounds in the manner assailed by the Commissioner may well provide the necessary link or symmetry.

<tocase>Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1784.html</AustLII>
<text>More recently, however, the importance to be attached to the merits of the appeal has, arguably, been downgraded in its ranking among the criteria to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted. For example, in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 at [5] , Jessup J observed: 
 A party to a proceeding in the Tribunal has an appeal as of right on a question of law. Such an appeal is in the nature of a new proceeding in the original jurisdiction of the court. It is unnecessary for an applicant in such an appeal to have grounds of any particular strength or intrinsic merit (although I recognise, of course, the relevance of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in these, as in all other, original proceedings). For this reason (and perhaps the more so because of the availability of s 31A) , I consider that the court should be slow to reject an application for an extension of time under s 44(2A) of the AAT Act, where otherwise the principles in Hunter are appropriately satisfied, for no reason other than that the appeal, if prosecuted, would be unlikely even very unlikely to succeed. I note that this was effectively the approach taken by the court in Mustafa v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2000] FCA 1897 and in Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2005] FCA 1904. I consider that such an approach would be consistent with that taken by Fitzgerald J in Lucic [ v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411] and, because his Honour followed Lucic , by Wilcox J in Hunter .</text>

<text>The Commissioner's opposition to the grant of an extension of time for the applicant to file a notice of appeal from the decision of the Tribunal was mainly, indeed wholly, grounded on the principle in (5), namely, the merits of the applicant's proposed appeal. In submissions, the Commissioner referred to the fact that in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1999] FCA 1198 ; 99 ATC 4852 at [12] a Full Court of this Court referred to that matter as an 'important consideration'; an applicant should show that he or she has an 'arguable case' to warrant an extension of time: Brown , at first instance [1999] FCA 563 ; , 99 ATC 4516 at [56] per Hill J, accepting the view of von Doussa J in Windshuttle v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1993] FCA 553 ; (1993) 46 FCR 235 at 243.</text>

<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/176.html</AustLII>
<text>Although the discretion to extend time to institute an appeal pursuant to O 53 r 7 of the Rules is not expressly confined by specified criteria, there is a range of factors of varying actual importance, which have been developed by the Court in analogous situations. Frequently relied on are the criteria referred to by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 where his Honour was concerned with s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the AD(JR) Act') which, like O 53 r 7, does not set out any criteria by reference to which the court's discretion to extend time for an application for review under s 5 of the AD(JR) Act is to be exercised. At 348 his Honour said: 
 Already there have been a number of decisions of judges of this Court, all sitting at first instance, dealing with the approach proper to be taken. They differ a little, both in language and in emphasis, but I venture to suggest that from them may be distilled the following principles to guide, not in any exhaustive manner, the exercise of the court's discretion ...

His Honour then went on to deal with each of these principles, which, relevantly, may be paraphrased in the following way: 
(1) Special circumstances need not be shown but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied that it is proper to do so. It is a pre-condition to the exercise of discretion in his favour that the applicant for extension show an 'acceptable explanation of the delay' and that it is 'fair and equitable in the circumstances' to extend time.
 
(2) A distinction is to be made between the case of a person who, by non-curial means, has continued to make the decision-maker aware that he contests the finality of the decision and a case where the decision-maker was allowed to believe the matter was finally concluded.
 
(3) Any prejudice to the respondent occasioned by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension.
 
(4) The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension.
 
(5) The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.

More recently, however, the importance to be attached to the merits of the appeal has, arguably, been downgraded in its ranking among the criteria to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted. For example, in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 at [5] , Jessup J observed:

<text>The lack of compliance was not articulated with any great precision or clarity.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/920.html</AustLII>
<text>Nevertheless, his Honour at [6] went on: 
 While it will be apparent that I do not consider that an application for an extension of time is an occasion for any more than the most cursory examination of the merits of the proposed proceeding, nonetheless I recognise that, if such an examination does reveal the proceeding as being conspicuously devoid of merit, the application might well be rejected upon the ground that the prosecution of it would, in effect, be pointless. 

 
In relation to this last observation, see Tey v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 920 at [28] [33] per Gilmour J.

Having regard to the following facts and circumstances, namely: 
(1) That Mr Hua, an unqualified person, appeared on behalf of the applicant at the hearing before the Tribunal;
 
(2) the evidence embodied in Ex. 2, none of which was challenged; and
 
(3) the evidence embodied in Ex. 1, none of which was challenged,
 
I am satisfied that the only relevant consideration, a conclusion on which might militate against an exercise of discretion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, is whether the grounds of appeal as articulated in the amended draft notice of appeal disclose an arguable case, even if it is unlikely to succeed, or whether they are so devoid of merit as to render prosecution of the appeal pointless. Before turning to that issue, it is necessary that I deal with the various bases upon which the Commissioner assailed the amended draft notice of appeal.

The Commissioner assailed the grounds relied on in the amended draft notice of appeal on an holistic basis claiming that they did not comply with O 53 r 3(2)(d) of the Rules which expressly provides that a notice of appeal must state 'briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought'.</text>
