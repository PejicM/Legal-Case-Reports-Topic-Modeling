<text>22 I should add that some of the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant and some of the alleged questions of law would have been more appropriate in a general judicial review application than in an appeal on a question of law. I have remarked in other cases that this situation is unsatisfactory and unnecessary (eg Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 at 45 46). 


 I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

<text>19 The AAT stands in the shoes of the Department and is in precisely the same situation as the decision maker. The fact that, as a practical matter, it chooses to conduct quasi-adversarial proceedings and does not have available direct access to medical specialists for the purposes of investigation, does not change the nature of the function being performed by it. The provisions of s 33 of the AAT Act give ample scope for the AAT to arrange investigation of a claim. The decision maker is bound to use his or her best endeavours to assist the AAT to make its decision (s 33(1AA)). The AAT has inquisitorial powers and may exercise them where appropriate. (See, generally, McDonald v Director-General of Social Security (1984) 1 FCR 354.) It is not, of course, every case that will require such measures. In general, an applicant for a benefit must satisfy the decision maker of the necessary criteria. However, cases such as this may demand such an approach (cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169 170; Luu v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39 at 49 50). The AAT did not arrange investigations to test the validity of the speculation about each condition. It should have made a decision made on the material before it without taking account of hypothetical third party investigations.</text>
