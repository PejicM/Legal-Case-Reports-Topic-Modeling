<text>The scope of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and the requirement that the notice of appeal state a question, or questions of law, have been discussed in the authorities.

<text>The question whether the Tribunal has complied with s 43(2B) in a particular case is, I think, a question of law: Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 253 ALR 263 at 271-273 [30] - [37] per Perram J.</text>

<tocase>Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 137</tocase>
<text>Since writing these reasons, I note that the Full Court of this Court held in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 137 that a failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 43(2) of the AAT Act is an error of law. However, the Court also held that a failure to comply with s 43(2) did not inevitably lead to an order setting aside the decision. Whether the decision is set aside will depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 44(5) of the AAT Act.</text>

<tocase>Lang v Comcare (2007) 44 AAR 370</tocase>
<text>The question whether a failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 43(2B) is an error of law which vitiates the Tribunal's decision is not, as far as I can see, clearly answered by the authorities: Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-446 per Brennan J; Comcare Australia v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 658-659 per Finkelstein J; TelePacific Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 58 ATR 441 at 451 per Sackville J; Lang v Comcare (2007) 44 AAR 370. The answer to the question may turn on an examination of the effect of the particular failure on the Tribunal's decision. I do not need to determine the question in this case because I have decided that the Tribunal did not fail to comply with s 43(2B).

The obligation in s 43(2B) relates to the Tribunal's "findings on material questions of fact". On one view, the material question of fact on the particular issue of whether the applicant was unemployed within s 593(1) was the level or intensity of the applicant's vehicle-related activities judged by reference to the amount of time and effort he expended on those activities. The Tribunal made its decision with respect to that matter by drawing inferences from evidence it accepted. On one view, the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant's evidence on this topic was unreliable was no more than the rejection of an item of evidence which might otherwise have assisted it in making its finding on a material question of fact. On this view, the Tribunal's conclusion on the reliability or otherwise of the applicant's evidence was not a finding on a material question of fact. Without pausing to discuss some of the issues which arise, I refer to Xu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1741 ; (1999) 95 FCR 425 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323. I will not take such an approach because it seems to me that, in a case of this nature the better view is that the question of what is a finding on a material question of fact depends very much on the nature and circumstances of the decision. That was the approach taken by Stone J in Lang v Comcare (2007) 44 AAR 370. In this case, the applicant's evidence as to the time he spent on his vehicle-related activities was an important consideration in terms of a decision as to whether he was unemployed within the meaning of the term in s 593(1) of the Act. He was the only witness before the Tribunal who could and did give direct evidence on the issue.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/483.html</AustLII>
<text>The Tribunal set out the legal principles relevant to a determination of whether the applicant was "unemployed" within the meaning of that term in s 593(1) of the Act. He referred to the decision of Graham J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 ; (2006) 152 FCR 541. One of the principles the Tribunal formulated was that the question of whether a person is unemployed is a question of fact and degree, and regard should be had to the intensity with which the person applies himself or herself to particular work or a particular enterprise. There is no doubt that the question of whether a person is unemployed is essentially one of fact and degree to be decided having regard to the relevant principles: McAuliffe v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1992] FCA 483 ; (1992) 28 ALD 609. It was not suggested on the appeal that the Tribunal had applied the wrong legal test.</text>

<tocase>Suters v Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 28 ALD 320</tocase>
<text>In so far as there was an obligation on the Tribunal, aside from s 43(2B) of the AAT Act, to explain its reasons for rejecting evidence not directly contradicted by other evidence (see Suters v Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 28 ALD 320) , the Tribunal complied with that obligation.

As part of ground one, the applicant submitted that the matters the Tribunal relied on could not justify the finding it made. First, he contended that because his dishonesty did not occur in his claim for the newstart allowance, or in the course of his evidence to the Tribunal, it should have been ignored. That contention is incorrect and his dishonesty was a matter the Tribunal was entitled to take into account. Secondly, he contended that the Tribunal erred in concluding that the total number of vehicles "emerged progressively". However, that is a challenge to a finding of fact and cannot be characterised as an error of law having regard to the fact that there was evidence upon which the Tribunal could make that finding. Ground two

The second ground also relates to the findings of the Tribunal referred to in ground one. It is said by the applicant that an important part of the applicant's vehicle-related activities was the repair work carried out by the applicant himself. The first limb of the second ground is that there was no challenge to the applicant's evidence in this respect and that therefore the Tribunal's finding was made in breach of the rules of procedural fairness. The second limb of the second ground is that the Tribunal's finding that the applicant had underestimated the time he spent on vehicle-related activities was not based on any evidence.</text>
