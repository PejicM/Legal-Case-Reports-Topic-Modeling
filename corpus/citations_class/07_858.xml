<tocase>Downes v Cottam, In re Beddoe [1893] 1 Ch 547</tocase>
<text>There are exceptions to the rule that the company's assets should bear the costs. Broadly speaking, if the liquidator acts unreasonably, recklessly or even negligently and his conduct leads to the unnecessary incurring of costs, those costs ought to be paid by the liquidator: In re Beddoe; Downes v Cottam [1893] 1 Ch 547; Mead v Watson (2005) 23 ACLC 718. In deciding whether the liquidator is acting unreasonably it is necessary to have regard to s 545 of the Corporations Act . Subsection (1) provides that "a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property". (There are certain exceptions in relation to lodging of documents with ASIC: see s 545(3).) The effect of the section is that, apart from lodging certain documents, a liquidator is not required to do anything if he cannot recover his expenses. It means the liquidator commits no wrong in failing to carry out any duties.</text>

<tocase>Marseilles Extension Railway and Land Company, In re (1885) 30 Ch D 598</tocase>
<text>There is a general rule that in a proceeding by or against a liquidator the real party to the action is the company and the company's assets are responsible for the costs: In re Marseilles Extension Railway and Land Company (1885) 30 Ch D 598. Of course if the liquidator is the plaintiff he will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful defendant but has an indemnity for those costs. If this were not the rule a liquidator would be in an impossible position. He would only bring an action if it were bound to succeed. He might not resist claims brought against the company unless they were clearly hopeless. There is also the risk that good people would be deterred from taking on the responsibility of acting as a liquidator: Re Wilson Lovatt &amp; Sons Ltd [1977] 1 All ER 274.</text>
