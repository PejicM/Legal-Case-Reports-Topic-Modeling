<tocase>Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1426.html</AustLII>
<text>There are various considerations that may be relevant in determining an appropriate penalty for a contravention of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . They include: 
(a) the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place;
 
(b) the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches, including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate disregard of the applicable law; 
 
(c) the consequences of the contravening conduct, including the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result;
 
(d) where more than one contravention of the Act is involved, whether the contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct;
 
(e) whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in similar unlawful conduct; and
 
(f) the need for specific and general deterrence.
 
See Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at 69 [40] per Tracey J and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] - [8] per Branson J, both of which have been cited with approval. These factors are relevant in this case.

In Stuart-Mahoney , Tracey J also included a number of other factors, such as the size of the business enterprise involved; whether senior management was involved in the breaches; whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition; whether the party committing the breach had taken corrective action; whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities; and the need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements. As appears in the following discussion, some of these factors have some bearing on the appropriate penalties in this case.

It is convenient to consider the question of penalties, having regard to the various factors falling for consideration.

Similar unlawful conduct in the past is relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed, although not a penalty that is disproportionate to the contravention in question: see Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) 94 IR at 232 [7]-[8] per Branson J. As Tracey J observed in Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR at 70 [44], "[s]imilar previous conduct demonstrates that the respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question, that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re-engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions". Also, as his Honour went on to say: 
 
 Conduct which is of a different character does not assist this assessment: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 389 [67] . Similar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance.

In this case, any previous contraventions by the respondents of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act will be relevant. The applicant submitted that the Union had previously been found to have contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act in Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61. In Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61, the respondent Union admitted (on 16 April 2008) that, in October 2005, it had contravened ss 38 and 43 of that Act. On 19 September 2008, the Court made declarations to that effect and imposed penalties. The respondents noted, correctly in my view, that this contravention of s 43 is not properly treated as a prior contravention: the conduct in question preceded the first contravention here (on 15 February 2006) but was not the subject of judicial decision (or admission) until last year. Stuart-Mahoney shows, however, that the Union did in fact engage in similar conduct prior to 15 February 2006 a fact that may be taken into account although accorded less significance than if the matter had been dealt with by the Court before 15 February 2006.

In Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR at 71 [49], Tracey J held that the Union was a very large national organisation. On the basis of Mr Gregor's affidavit, I would reach the same conclusion. Its financial report for the year ending 31 December 2007 stated that, as at 31 December 2007, the Union had 103,850 members and net assets of $382,393.

Mr Mates stands in a very different position to the Union. He is an individual employed as a worker on a building site.

There was in this case no evidence that any senior official or members of the governing bodies of the Union were involved in the contravening conduct. Accordingly, the present case is distinguishable from the situation in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 ; (2005) 224 ALR 467 , where Merkel J found (at 475 [27]) that CBA acted through senior executives in its contravening conduct. The case is also distinguishable from Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61, where (at 71 [51]) Tracey J noted that the contraventions in that case took place with the knowledge and consent of senior Union officials. This is not an aggravating circumstance in this case.

Section 3(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act specifically states that the main object of the Act is "to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole". The imposition of penalties for contraventions of provisions such as s 43 is one way in which this is achieved. As already noted, the contraventions under consideration were clear. Bearing these factors in mind, the need for general deterrence is plain enough, with the result that penalties should be imposed at what has been termed a "meaningful level" to serve as a general deterrence to others who may be disposed to engage in the conduct in question: see Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61 at 72 [58], citing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] ; Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia 224 ALR at 479 [41]; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd [2001] FCA 383 ; [2001] ATPR 41-815 at [13] .

The respondents argued for lower penalties, bearing in mind Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61, which they noted involved the imposition of an overtime ban over a period of six days for all employees, in response to the builder's refusal to engage apprentices. The trial judge held that the ban was designed to disrupt work, and senior management of the Union knew of and consented to its imposition. The respondents submitted that, in all the relevant circumstances, the appropriate level of penalty that should be imposed on the Union was $10,000, and on Mr Mates, $2,500.

The respondents argued that such a level of penalty was consistent with the fact that what was involved in this case was significantly less serious than the contravening conduct found in Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61 (also a s 43 breach). The applicant replied that this case warranted a significantly higher penalty than in Stuart-Mahoney , noting other alleged features of the respective cases.

Ultimately, whilst consideration of Stuart-Mahoney is helpful, the fact remains that each case must be considered, having regard to its own facts. Unsurprisingly, Stuart-Mahoney was different from this case in a number of material respects.</text>

See Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at 69 [40] per Tracey J and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] - [8] per Branson J, both of which have been cited with approval. These factors are relevant in this case.

Similar unlawful conduct in the past is relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed, although not a penalty that is disproportionate to the contravention in question: see Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) 94 IR at 232 [7]-[8] per Branson J.

Similar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance.

In support of this proposition, the respondents relied on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Temple v Powell 173 IR 189 at 209 [63]. In Leighton Contractors , the Supreme Court of Western Australia was called to fix a penalty for contravention of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . In connection with the Union's prior contraventions, after citing with approval the comments of Branson J in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) 94 IR 231 (see [9] above), Le Miere J said (at 390 [67]) that: 
 
 One matter her Honour considered was whether the respondent had previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of that Act. In my view, that is the correct approach. It is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the first defendant anywhere in Australia. The first defendant is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia. Branches, Divisions, officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day. It is inappropriate to take account of the conduct of the first defendant through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in questions and are contraventions of different legislation.</text>

<tocase>Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 548</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/548.html</AustLII>
<text>I agree with his Honour's observations: compare Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 548 at [16] per Jessup J and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at 209 [64] per Dowsett J.

Further, on 13 March 2009, in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 , Jessup J found that, on 31 July 2006, Mr Mates and the Union had committed two breaches of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act by organising a stoppage of work on a building site and threatening to organise a further stoppage unless the employer engaged a labourer. On 28 May 2009, Jessup J dealt with the matter of penalties: see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. (With the consent of the applicant, the respondents advised me that this last-mentioned judgment was the subject of an appeal.)

Plainly enough, Williams is not to be treated as a prior contravention on the part of Mr Mates or the Union since the conduct in question post-dated the 15 February 2006 contravention in this case and had not been the subject of any judicial decision until this year. Always bearing this in mind, the findings of contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act are not necessarily irrelevant to the assessment of penalty and may be taken into appropriate account.

In addition to these matters, the applicant relied on various other decisions as indicative of a prior history on the Union's part. In particular, the applicant argued that the Union had a substantial history of engaging in similar conduct because it had been found to have engaged in unlawful coercion on numerous previous occasions contrary to:

A lengthier list of judicially determined contraventions of industrial legislation was set out in exhibit MG 2 to Mr Gregor's affidavit, and, as the respondents noted, included matters that were not properly to be treated as prior contraventions. I would not regard this evidence as inadmissible but the matters mentioned are to be accorded substantially less weight than those contraventions specifically mentioned above and, in some instances, virtually no weight at all.

Various other judicial statements have been made concerning the significance of a prior contravention in a different state or territory: see A &amp; L Silvestri v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [13] and Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 at [18] - [19] per Jessup J. Nothing to which I have been referred dissuades me from the view that, whilst prior contraventions in any state and territories may be relevant to fixing the penalty to be imposed on the Union, it will be for the Court in each case to consider the question of weight, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.

Until Jessup J's decision in Williams [2009] FCA 223 , Mr Mates had not been found to have contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act or any other industrial legislation. The applicant referred to Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 178 IR 47, in which, on 28 November 2008, Marshall J found that, in October 2005, the Union had contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Although the report of the case indicates that Mr Mates was involved in the events resulting in the contravention finding against the Union, there was no finding of contravention against Mr Mates. Further, for present purposes, I accept that s 38 involves consideration of facts of a different kind to that involved in a s 43 contravention.

Jessup J's judgment in Williams [2009] FCA 223 was delivered on 13 March 2009, and involved findings that, on 31 July 2006, Mr Mates and the Union had each committed two breaches of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Whilst these breaches cannot be treated as prior contraventions, they can be taken into account in imposing penalties in this case. I note, of course, that they involve judicial findings made earlier this year in respect of conduct five months after 15 February 2006. These considerations affect the weight to be given Williams in imposing penalties here.

The applicant submitted that the three contraventions in question here were distinct, although they all related to the respondents' purpose of coercing Hardcorp to meet their demands regarding the re-employment of Messrs Deans and O'Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and the allocation of particular responsibilities and duties.

Much the same must also be said of Williams [2009] FCA 223 and Williams (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. Consideration of them is helpful, but ultimately the factors relevant to the imposition of penalties differ.</text>

<text>I agree with his Honour's observations: compare Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 548 at [16] per Jessup J and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at 209 [64] per Dowsett J.

In support of this proposition, the respondents relied on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Temple v Powell 173 IR 189 at 209 [63]. In Leighton Contractors , the Supreme Court of Western Australia was called to fix a penalty for contravention of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . In connection with the Union's prior contraventions, after citing with approval the comments of Branson J in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) 94 IR 231 (see [9] above), Le Miere J said (at 390 [67]) that: 
 
 One matter her Honour considered was whether the respondent had previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of that Act. In my view, that is the correct approach. It is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the first defendant anywhere in Australia. The first defendant is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia. Branches, Divisions, officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day. It is inappropriate to take account of the conduct of the first defendant through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in questions and are contraventions of different legislation.

In imposing penalties in respect of admitted breaches of ss 170MN and 178 of the Workplace Relations Act and s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act , Dowsett J said in Temple v Powell 173 IR 189 at 209 [63]: 
 
 The respondents submitted that in a large organisation such as the CFMEU, with autonomous state branches, it is not necessarily appropriate to treat conduct by all branches throughout the country as relevant past conduct for the purpose of fixing a penalty in connection with the unlawful conduct of one branch. There is substance in that submission. Whether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic. In some cases a pattern of conduct across the country may suggest a nationwide plan of action or a national culture of misconduct. In other cases it may appear that a particular branch or geographical region has acted alone in adopting a plan of action or has developed a particular culture. It was also submitted that past conduct cannot operate so as to increase the penalty beyond that which is appropriate to the misconduct in question. That proposition mat be correct, but it should not be taken as implying that past misconduct is irrelevant to the fixing of penalty.

In neither of these passages was the Court laying down a hard and fast rule that prior contraventions of another autonomous division or branch of the Union should never be taken into account. Whether or not prior contraventions will be relevant and, if relevant, accorded any and what weight will necessarily depend on the nature and circumstances, as disclosed in the record of the prior contraventions.

In this context, if it appeared that a series of prior contraventions were part of any nationwide campaign, then this would plainly militate against an offending union. Plainly too, a union, considered as a single entity, cannot shrug off responsibility for prior contraventions just because they were geographically widespread. I accept that, as the relevant legislation provides, an organisation that organises itself into national and state division or branches is accountable for how its representatives operate, whether at divisional or branch level. This does not precisely answer the point at issue, however, because the place where a prior contravention occurred, the status of the Union representative through whom liability arose, and the nature of the organisation (here, including the structure of the Union) are, just like the date and precise nature of the conduct in question, a part of the circumstances to be considered when the weight to be given a prior contravention falls for determination. Prior contraventions may be indicative of a pattern of misconduct on the Union's part or a culture of disregard for the law. Or the circumstances may indicate that care should be taken in giving too much weight to these possibilities, particularly when it is apparent that the liability of the Union has come about through the actions of a site delegate or other local representative or member who may well be more affected by matters close at hand than any shared national interest, culture or concern. In many cases, these may be matters of impression that are not capable of too close analysis.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/497.html</AustLII>
<text>Conduct engaged in prior to 15 February 2006 (when the first contravention occurred) and for which no contravention was recorded until after 15 February 2006 is not treated as a prior contravention: see Alfred v Walter Construction Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 497 at [13] per Branson J. However, similar conduct engaged in prior to 15 February 2006 and for which a contravention was recorded after that date can be taken into account ( Alfred [2005] FCA 497 at [13] ) although will usually be given less weight than a prior contravention as judicially determined: see R v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 at 113 per King CJ and 124 per Cox J. Further, similar conduct subsequently found to have been done after the relevant date (here 15 February 2006) is not irrelevant to the assessment of appropriate penalty.

As the applicant noted, there have been cases involving s 170NC that have, in substance, involved judicial findings of similar unlawful conduct by the Union's representatives prior to 15 February 2006: see Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union , District Court of New South Wales, 5 March 2004 and Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497. Although involving different conduct, these two s 170NC cases may be said to demonstrate a similar modus operandi on the Union's part to this case in which coercion is used to secure control of employees on building site.

I would regard both these prior contraventions as relevant to the imposition of penalties, although I note that in both cases the conduct in question took place in New South Wales, rather than in Victoria. For reasons explained below, this affects the weight I would attach to them. As noted below, the question of weight is an unavoidable one when considering the significance of prior contraventions.

Each of the other s 170NC cases relied on by the applicant is in a different class.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/70.html</AustLII>
<text>The contraventions on 15, 17 and 21 February 2006 had the same purpose, namely, to coerce Hardcorp to re-employ Messrs Deans and O'Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and, amongst other things, to have Ms Singleton appointed as OH&amp;S officer on the Mount Street site. This was the common thread running through the offending conduct of 15, 17 and 21 February 2006. To this extent, the comparison with Hamberger v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 585 is justified. Further, the fact of this common thread should be taken into account in fixing penalties, but, in my view, the contravening conduct is not, for this reason, properly seen as one course of conduct. This is because the conduct comprising each of the contraventions was separate and distinct in time and place, and in the coercion that the Union exerted. The conduct on 15 February 2006 involved demands and threats to cause trouble at the Mount Street site if the demands were not met. The conduct on 17 February 2006 involved similar demands and threats but on a different day and place, and in a different context with different participants in the occasion of the contravention. The conduct on 21 February 2006 involved Mr Mates coming on to the site and shutting down the crane. Therefore, these are three separate and distinct contraventions: compare Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 396-399 [41] - [55] ; [2008] FCAFC 70 at [41] - [55] per Stone and Buchanan JJ.

As noted above, where (as here) penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions, it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case. As Tracey J said in Stuart-Mohoney 177 IR at 73 [60]: 
 
 
 Another factor to be considered is the totality principle. This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [30] referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [89] . The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct. The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 238 ; 145 ALR 36 at 53 and Ponzio at [145] per Jessup J. 
 
 

Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent's contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct. Neither respondent has expressed any contrition.</text>

<text>The totality principle must, however, apply: see Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63. Where penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions, it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case.

Penalties must be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent's contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct. Penalties must also be sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and others who might be tempted to engage in contravening conduct. Deterrence is a primary objective of penalties.

In argument, the parties referred to some considerations beyond those mentioned at paragraph [9] above. I discuss each of these additional matters seriatim before turning to the major issue of deterrence. The first such matter was the size and financial position of the Union.</text>

<text>Until Jessup J's decision in Williams [2009] FCA 223 , Mr Mates had not been found to have contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act or any other industrial legislation. The applicant referred to Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 178 IR 47, in which, on 28 November 2008, Marshall J found that, in October 2005, the Union had contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Although the report of the case indicates that Mr Mates was involved in the events resulting in the contravention finding against the Union, there was no finding of contravention against Mr Mates. Further, for present purposes, I accept that s 38 involves consideration of facts of a different kind to that involved in a s 43 contravention.

Of course, to say the Union is a large national organisation is not to deny that the Union is a non-profit-making enterprise, a consideration that has sometimes been taken into account in the Union's favour: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517 at [8] per Gray J; Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 243 at [44] per Marshall J; and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/336.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant noted that there was no evidence of any regret, contrition or remorse on the part of the Union or Mr Mates for their contravening conduct, and there was no apology. The respondents replied (and I accept) that this was not an aggravating circumstance that justified an increase in the level of the penalty: compare BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 at [10] per Kiefel J.

The applicant further noted that there was no evidence of any corrective action taken by the Union or Mr Mates in relation to the contraventions. Again this is not an aggravating circumstance that would justify a higher penalty.

The applicant submitted that the respondents had chosen not to cooperate with him or the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The applicant further contended that the respondents' lack of cooperation, and failure to make admissions of liability whilst making only limited admissions of facts, necessitated the preparation of a great deal of evidence and led to a lengthy trial. This placed a burden on the limited resources of the Court and the applicant. The applicant further submitted that the respondents' conduct during the proceeding deserved censure. The applicant commented adversely on the respondents' failure to call witnesses after filing and serving witness statements, and the abandonment of their defence (that there was a crane malfunction) on the first day of trial. The applicant claimed "[a] vast amount of work needed to be undertaken ... to respond to [this] Defence".</text>

<text>These factors may be relevant to costs (discussed below) but they do not amount to aggravating circumstances justifying a higher penalty than otherwise. This is consistent with the conclusion reached by the Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at 285 [166] .

The applicant submitted that the respondents' conduct was serious in that, if left unchecked, it would undermine the statutory purposes of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act as set out in s 3 of the Act. In effect, this consideration has previously been considered in connection with the nature and extent of the unlawful conduct.

<text>Section 3(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act specifically states that the main object of the Act is "to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole". The imposition of penalties for contraventions of provisions such as s 43 is one way in which this is achieved. As already noted, the contraventions under consideration were clear. Bearing these factors in mind, the need for general deterrence is plain enough, with the result that penalties should be imposed at what has been termed a "meaningful level" to serve as a general deterrence to others who may be disposed to engage in the conduct in question: see Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61 at 72 [58], citing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] ; Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia 224 ALR at 479 [41]; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd [2001] FCA 383 ; [2001] ATPR 41-815 at [13] .</text>

<text>There was in this case no evidence that any senior official or members of the governing bodies of the Union were involved in the contravening conduct. Accordingly, the present case is distinguishable from the situation in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 ; (2005) 224 ALR 467 , where Merkel J found (at 475 [27]) that CBA acted through senior executives in its contravening conduct. The case is also distinguishable from Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61, where (at 71 [51]) Tracey J noted that the contraventions in that case took place with the knowledge and consent of senior Union officials. This is not an aggravating circumstance in this case.

<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>The usual practice is that costs follow the event, with the result that the Court will order the recovery of costs by a successful party on a party and party basis. The matter of costs is, however, in the general discretion of the Court, although the discretion must be exercised judicially, that is, in a principled way by reference to the litigation: see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 [9]-[10].

In some circumstances, the usual rule will be found wanting and success on a portion only of a claim may make it reasonable for the litigant to bear the expense of the portion in which the litigant failed. Sometimes too, an otherwise successful litigant may be ordered to pay the costs of the other party in respect of the issues on which that litigant failed. As Black CJ and French J said in Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) 115 FCR 229 at 236 [15], "[u]sually the circumstances in which a successful party is denied all or part of its costs have to do with its conduct of the proceedings". Their Honour continued (236-237 [15] and [18]): 
 
 Within the general discretion to award costs, costs may be refused where, for example, the applicant has made an exaggerated claim which has occupied a significant proportion of the proceedings and has succeeded only on a minor aspect of its original claim. Costs may be apportioned according to success or failure on particular distinct or severable issues ... And a trial judge may award only a proportion of the successful party's costs if the conduct of that party at trial was such as to unreasonably prolong the proceedings ... 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 That a proceeding was brought otherwise than for the personal or financial gain of the applicant, and in that sense in the public interest, does not detract from the general proposition that ordinarily costs follow the event and that the primary factor in deciding on the award of costs is the outcome of the litigation.</text>

<text>Bearing in mind matters of the kind referred to by Jacobs J in Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 15, courts ordinarily exercise some care before making an apportionment of costs of the kind the respondents seek. Thus, the Full Court in Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [2000] FCA 62 at [4] declined to make such an order, upon the basis that: 
 
 The appellant succeeded completely in terms of the final orders it secured. The issues it raised in argument on the appeal were not unreasonably raised. The somewhat complex factual background was a matter which had to be considered in relation to all issues. None of the issues raised can be characterised in terms of the time and work involved as distinct and severable from the other issues to the extent that an apportionment would be warranted. 
 

The applicant and the respondents all relied on this passage, pointing to different factors in their favour. In the present case, the key factor is that the applicant has not acted unreasonably in raising any issues in the context of the facts as they understood them.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/107.html</AustLII>
<text>So far as the law permits and is practicable, however, fairness should govern the disposition of costs: compare Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107 at [5] per as Finkelstein and Gordon JJ. The critical factor in support of a departure from the usual order as to costs is that the applicant has failed in respect of his allegations concerning events after the crane incident on 21 February 2006 and following, which turned on additional and different evidence to the earlier events. These allegations were that: (1) on 21 February 2006, Mr Mates telephoned the office of the crane company and said that its crew were not to work on the project at Mount Street; (2) on 21 February 2006, Mr Mates telephoned the Union's offices or a representative of the Union and instructed the person he contacted to instruct Maurie Hill (the Union organiser responsible for mobile cranes in Victoria (FEDFA division)) to ring Sergi Cranes and other crane operators to warn them off working at the Mount Street site; and (3) on 22 February 2006 and following, Mr Mates organised a picket line at the Mount Street site. The applicant further alleged that the Union and/or Mr Mates had contravened s 38 of the Act in that Mr Mates' alleged conduct on 21 February 2006 and in organising a picket line at the Mount Street site between 22 February 2006 and 3 March 2006 constituted "building industrial action" within the meaning of paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition in s 36(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act .

Plainly enough, some significant amount of time and effort was devoted to that part of the applicant's unsuccessful case, although it is difficult to quantify this precisely. In all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to deprive the applicant of a percentage of his trial costs. Having regard to these circumstances, I consider that it would be fair and just to deprive the applicant of 40 per cent of his trial costs. It would be inappropriate to order the applicant to pay any portion of the respondents' costs.</text>
