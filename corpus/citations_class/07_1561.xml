<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>159 I accept the evidence of Mr Mantach as to what he was told by Nicolas Robinson. Although as counsel for the Robinsons stressed, there was no contemporaneous note (other than the reference to 200 acres) and the conversation occurred some ten years ago, the fact that there was a conversation about the cropping area is corroborated by the valuation report itself made at the time, albeit that it creates a misleading impression. Although the Robinson brothers were present in the court for most of the hearing, they did not give evidence. I think the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 entitles me to infer that their evidence on this critical issue would not have assisted them. There is added significance in the fact that the absent witnesses are a party, and a person closely associated with that party in the matters the subject of the litigation: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 410 ; (2006) 150 FCR 494 at [52] .</text>

<tocase>Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 70 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 432</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1907/70.html</AustLII>
<text>194 The answer to this question is: yes. In any case, I note that the Mantach case was not put on the basis that the test of market value as laid down in Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 70 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 432 would have been applied differently if Mr Mantach has known his valuation was for a purchaser rather than a mortgagee. The complaint against Mr Mantach was that his valuations were too high. Understandably, he did not put forward a case along these lines: valuations for mortgagees tend to be low, I thought these valuations were for mortgage purposes, had I known they were for a purchaser they would have been higher.

195 It was put on behalf of Mantach that Mr Macleod admitted in evidence that he expected the valuer would contact the owner to arrange inspections and have discussions and communications with the owners. Counsel also pointed out that Mr Wright was the sole director of the applicant from its incorporation on 5 December 2000 until he was joined by Messrs Cottrell and Andriske on 15 March 2001. Mr Wright remained a director until 23 January 2003.

196 As already mentioned, Mr Wright wrote a letter to Boyds on 25 January 2001 arguing the merits of the Robinson properties, criticising the valuations (particularly those of Cubbins) and asking for a higher price. On 1 February he wrote again answering queries by Boyds about the properties. On 15 February Boyds sent the Letter of Understanding to him.</text>

366 Section 82(1B) of the Trade Practices Act , inserted by Schedule 3 item 5 of the Corporate Law Economic Reform (Audit and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004 (Cth) is concerned with claims in relation to economic loss caused by conduct in contravention of s 52. It provides for reduction of damages to the extent that the Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in responsibility for the loss or damage. It altered the well-established law that contributory negligence is not available in reduction of damages for claims under Pt V of the Trade Practices Act : I &amp; L Securities.</text>

<tocase>Flemington Properties Pty Ltd v Raine &amp; Horne Commercial Pty Ltd (1997) 148 ALR 271</tocase>
<text>322 Counsel for both the Robinsons and Mantach submitted that Broadmoor is now worth what was paid for it and thus there is no capital loss: Flemington Properties Pty Ltd v Raine &amp; Horne Commercial Pty Ltd (1997) 148 ALR 271. The factual basis is not made out: see [306]-[311] above. The submission must therefore be rejected. Nevertheless, since Flemington Properties loomed large, especially in the submissions of Mantach, its application to the present case warrants some discussion.

323 Flemington Properties concerned a valuation of land for a prospective purchaser. The land was subject to a 99 year lease to a statutory authority. The defendant's valuation was $11.5m-$12.9m. The purchaser bought the land for $9.5m. After the purchase the New South Wales Valuer-General valued the land for the purpose of rent calculation at $10.4m. By the time of the trial the purchaser had sold a substantial portion of the land for $13.75m and retained a large parcel valued at $8m. The purchaser claimed as damages the difference between the price paid and the market value at the time of purchase. It is not clear from the report whether, as seems implicit from the argument of the purchaser, there was some valuation at less than $9.5m. In any event, Lehane J found that the valuer had not been negligent, but went on to make observations on other issues, including whether the purchaser had suffered any loss. Since his Honour's observations were obiter, I am not subject to the convention that a judgment of another single judge should be followed unless thought to be clearly wrong.

327 One of the arguments of the valuer appellant was that the courts below should have restricted damages to the difference between valuation and true value at the time of valuation, in accordance with the Potts v Miller line of cases. The valuer's negligence, it was said, was not the cause of the further loss which resulted from a "supervening event", the fall in the market. The case was thus the converse of Flemington Properties where the defendant valuer had sought to claim the benefit of a post-valuation rise in the market.

331 In Flemington Properties at 316 Lehane J disagreed with that statement. But as long as it is kept in mind that the Potts v Miller rule is not a rigid and inflexible one, the negotiability or otherwise of the property in question seems to be both a sensible rationale of the rule and a guide to possible exceptions.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1940/43.html</AustLII>
<text>324 Lehane J analysed a series of High Court, Full Federal Court and New South Wales Court of Appeal authorities: Potts v Miller [1940] HCA 43 ; (1940) 64 CLR 282, Toteff v Antonas [1952] HCA 16 ; (1952) 87 CLR 647, Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215, Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1, Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514, Kizbeau Pty Ltd v WG &amp; B Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4 ; (1995) 184 CLR 281, Morgan Corporate Ltd v GWG Leviny Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-414, Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio Pty Ltd (1988) 58 FCR 274 and Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 26 FCR 305.

327 One of the arguments of the valuer appellant was that the courts below should have restricted damages to the difference between valuation and true value at the time of valuation, in accordance with the Potts v Miller line of cases. The valuer's negligence, it was said, was not the cause of the further loss which resulted from a "supervening event", the fall in the market. The case was thus the converse of Flemington Properties where the defendant valuer had sought to claim the benefit of a post-valuation rise in the market.

328 Two elements of Kenny are relevant for present purposes. First, the retainer of the valuer specifically raised the question of value extending over a period into the future. As McHugh J commented at [59], the terms of the valuation made the case a "poor vehicle" to determine the correctness of the principle for which the valuer contended. Once the true nature of the representation as to value was properly understood, the statements in Potts v Miller , relied on to limit liability to the difference between the loan and the true value at time of the valuation, had no application to the case: at [62]. See also per Gummow J at [80] and per Kirby and Callinan JJ at [121].

330 By contrast, in Morgan Corporate a majority of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Meagher and Handley JJA, Mahoney JA dissenting) held that the Potts v Miller rule applied where units in a property trust bought at 82 cents were worth about that at the time of purchase but declined over three months to three cents and were worth one cent at the time of trial. Liability flowed from the defendant's misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the personal liability of directors of the plaintiff. Thus the wrongdoing in the case did not involve anything in relation to future value. Meagher JA said at 40,592, speaking of a reformulation in Wardley of the Potts v Miller rule, 
 
 
 ...one is conscious that the rule ... has as its fundamental postulate that a purchaser of property can always resell it. One knows that this may not always be so. In the present case, for example, it may have been that if the company sought to resell the units once the price of the units began to slide it would have found itself in the position where it could not have sold without redeeming the mortgage yet been unable to redeem the mortgage without recourse to the proceeds of the resale, which might have been insufficient of [sic] that purpose. Suffice it to say that no such case was pleaded or proved.

331 In Flemington Properties at 316 Lehane J disagreed with that statement. But as long as it is kept in mind that the Potts v Miller rule is not a rigid and inflexible one, the negotiability or otherwise of the property in question seems to be both a sensible rationale of the rule and a guide to possible exceptions.

334 Unlike Henderson, Morgan Corporate , and Kenny , the present case on the respondents' version (which, as it happens, I do not accept) is one of general market increase after the transaction. The transaction, however, was one partly caused by the respondents' wrongful conduct. There seems to be an unfairness in a respondent mitigating or eliminating its liability in such circumstances. Had the representations or valuations been true, at the time of trial the property would have been worth more than the representors' or valuer's figure. This is another way of looking at the point McHugh J makes in Kenny . The "true value" at the time of purchase will include an assessment of the prospects for future increase (or decline) in value. When an increase has in fact occurred by the time of trial, it should not affect the Potts v Miller assessment of the aggrieved party's loss: difference between price paid and true value at time of purchase. The exceptional case of unforeseeable boom between purchase or trial does not arise in the present case there is no suggestion of a property boom in North West Coast farming properties between 2001 and 2007. The evidence is all to the contrary.</text>

325 His Honour at 316 accepted that there was a rule, and certain exceptions to it, where property is acquired as a result of fraud, misrepresentation or misleading and deceptive conduct. The rule is that the usual measure of damage is the difference between the real value of the property at the time of purchase and what the plaintiff paid for it: see eg Gould at 220. An example of an exception is where the purchaser of a business continues to trade, either because he has no real alternative or because he has not become aware of the fraud, and incurs further losses which are not represented by the difference between the price and value of the business: Gould at 221. Lehane J at 316 said that 
 
 
 ...the rule seems really to be based upon considerations of causation and, possibly, foreseeability and to be a rule at least the usual effect of which is to limit the damages recoverable to so much as may reasonably be supposed to have been caused by the inducing conduct; that, of course explains not only the rule itself but also the exceptions. 
 
 
 His Honour concluded at 317 that the Court should not be "over zealous in applying the particular rule [loss is difference between price paid and value at time of purchase] at the expense of the more general principle [limiting damage to that reasonably caused by the inducing conduct]". The cases dealt with how loss was to be measured, rather than the prior question whether any loss has been caused. The money and money's worth which the applicant had obtained within five years of the purchase were to be taken into account and accordingly it had suffered no loss.</text>

330 By contrast, in Morgan Corporate a majority of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Meagher and Handley JJA, Mahoney JA dissenting) held that the Potts v Miller rule applied where units in a property trust bought at 82 cents were worth about that at the time of purchase but declined over three months to three cents and were worth one cent at the time of trial. Liability flowed from the defendant's misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the personal liability of directors of the plaintiff. Thus the wrongdoing in the case did not involve anything in relation to future value. Meagher JA said at 40,592, speaking of a reformulation in Wardley of the Potts v Miller rule, 
 
 
 ...one is conscious that the rule ... has as its fundamental postulate that a purchaser of property can always resell it. One knows that this may not always be so. In the present case, for example, it may have been that if the company sought to resell the units once the price of the units began to slide it would have found itself in the position where it could not have sold without redeeming the mortgage yet been unable to redeem the mortgage without recourse to the proceeds of the resale, which might have been insufficient of [sic] that purpose. Suffice it to say that no such case was pleaded or proved.</text>

<tocase>Kenny &amp; Good Pty Ltd v MGICA (1992) Ltd [1999] HCA 25 ; (1999) 199 CLR 413</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/25.html</AustLII>
<text>326 In Kenny &amp; Good Pty Ltd v MGICA (1992) Ltd [1999] HCA 25 ; (1999) 199 CLR 413 a valuer valued a property at $5.5m and recommended it as suitable for the investment of trust funds on mortgage to the extent of 65 per cent of its valuation for a term of three to five years. A mortgage insurer insured a mortgage for that percentage of the valuation. Upon default by the mortgagor, the property was sold for $2.65m. The trial judge (Lindgren J) found the valuer to have been negligent and that the true value at the time of valuation was $3.9m-$4m. The High Court held that the insurer could recover the full amount of the loss, and not just the difference between the valuation and the true value.

328 Two elements of Kenny are relevant for present purposes. First, the retainer of the valuer specifically raised the question of value extending over a period into the future. As McHugh J commented at [59], the terms of the valuation made the case a "poor vehicle" to determine the correctness of the principle for which the valuer contended. Once the true nature of the representation as to value was properly understood, the statements in Potts v Miller , relied on to limit liability to the difference between the loan and the true value at time of the valuation, had no application to the case: at [62]. See also per Gummow J at [80] and per Kirby and Callinan JJ at [121].

329 Another example of a wrongdoer being liable for fluctuations in value over a period was Henderson v Amadio Pty Ltd (No 1) (1995) 62 FCR 1. That case concerned an investment scheme for a purchase of a building leased to Coles Myer financed by a mortgage back to the vendor for a three year term, the scheme being sold on a promise of consistently increasing value over a much longer period; see at 198. Investors were hit by the catastrophic collapse of the Melbourne commercial property market in the early 1990s. In declining to apply a strict price less true value at time of purchase approach I relied on the English Court of Appeal decision in Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1995] QB 375. (Subsequently that decision was reversed by the House of Lords: Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1996] UKHL 10 ; [1997] AC 191. However, in Kenny the High Court preferred the Court of Appeal's decision.) In Henderson at 199 I characterised the scheme and its future value elements by a nautical metaphor: 
 
 
 The Coles Myer building investment scheme was like an overloaded and unseaworthy ship setting out on a long voyage. Given exceptionally fair winds and calm seas she might conceivably have reached her destination. However, she was always to be at severe risk from ordinary perils of the seas. The fact that what sunk her was a cyclone of 50-year severity hardly absolves those who caused her to be put to sea.

332 The second Kenny element is related to the first. It turns on the nature of a valuation. As already noted, that case concerned a market decline between transaction and trial. McHugh J at [48] pointed out that insofar as a decline in the market was reasonably foreseeable, it will already be factored into the assessment of the true value of the property as at the date of valuation. Present value cannot be divorced from future prospects: at [52]. His Honour observed (ibid): 
 
 
 The true value of a property on a particular day therefore reflects the likelihood of any risk that the price for the property in the reasonably foreseeable future will rise or fall on what it would have fetched the day before. 
 
 
 
 If not reasonably foreseeable, any loss arising from the decline must be regarded as outside the contemplation of the parties to the valuation arrangement and not recoverable. However, the particular arrangements in that case meant that the valuer was giving a warranty as to the value of the property over the next five years. This took the case out of the general rule: see at [58]-[62]. See also per Gummow J at [80].

333 In the present case the property in question was a freely negotiable commodity, farming land in a well established farming area. True it is the purchase of the Robinson properties was part of a larger joint venture arrangement. However, this did not impose any restriction on the purchaser's reselling.

334 Unlike Henderson, Morgan Corporate , and Kenny , the present case on the respondents' version (which, as it happens, I do not accept) is one of general market increase after the transaction. The transaction, however, was one partly caused by the respondents' wrongful conduct. There seems to be an unfairness in a respondent mitigating or eliminating its liability in such circumstances. Had the representations or valuations been true, at the time of trial the property would have been worth more than the representors' or valuer's figure. This is another way of looking at the point McHugh J makes in Kenny . The "true value" at the time of purchase will include an assessment of the prospects for future increase (or decline) in value. When an increase has in fact occurred by the time of trial, it should not affect the Potts v Miller assessment of the aggrieved party's loss: difference between price paid and true value at time of purchase. The exceptional case of unforeseeable boom between purchase or trial does not arise in the present case there is no suggestion of a property boom in North West Coast farming properties between 2001 and 2007. The evidence is all to the contrary.

354 In MGICA (1992) Ltd v Kenny &amp; Good Pty Ltd (1996) 140 ALR 313 at 356 ( Kenny at first instance) Lindgren J held that a valuation report in that case conveyed representations not only that the opinions expressed in them were held but also (a) that the opinions were based on reasonable grounds, (b) were the product of the exercise of due care and skill and (c), after making due allowance for their nature as opinions as to the market value of real estate at a particular time, safe to be relied upon and not outside the range of latitude properly to be allowed to them. The same can be said of the Mantach valuations in the present case.

356 The valuations of Mr Austin, which I accept, and even Mr Cripps, establish that there was here a gross overvaluation, which in itself is evidence of negligence: Baxter v F W Gapp Co Ltd [1939] 2 KB 271 at 277, Kenny (at first instance) at 335-337. This is confirmed by what happened when the properties were put up for sale in 2004: [139]-150] above. There were also identifiable errors, especially in the assessment of the croppable areas, but also in the use of some of the comparable sales and the inherently unreliable "catch-all" approach.

375 Gaudron A-CJ and Hayne J pointed out at [19] that if regard were to be had to culpability there would be "much to be said" for the view that the vendor's culpability and its causal significance were of such a different order from the conduct of the solicitor that no contribution should be ordered. The vendor's misleading conduct was a positive inducement to the purchaser whereas the solicitor's omission to advise further enquiries "merely had the consequence that (the vendor's) misleading conduct remained undetected". In similar vein McHugh J observed at [59] that it would be "absurd" to suggest that a person who stole money and was ordered to repay it could obtain contribution from a person who negligently failed to safeguard the money. In substance, his Honour thought, there was no difference between that example and the instant case.

376 A factor which much influenced the majority's approach was that the contribution would have the effect of repaying to the vendor half of the ill-gotten gains which he had to disgorge to the purchaser: per Gaudron A-CJ and Hayne J at [22], per McHugh J at [65]. Also, as the latter pointed out at [66], contribution would be inconsistent with the policy considerations behind Pts V and VI of the Trade Practices Act . Contribution would enable a person in breach of s 52 to profit by its contravention of the Act. The vendor would be able to obtain $375,000 from the solicitor even though its misleading and deceptive conduct had misled him (as well as the purchaser).

377 In the present case the application of those principles mandates a conclusion that the Robinsons, whose conduct misled and deceived Mantach as well as the applicant, are not entitled to contribution from the former.

378 Mantach is entitled on its cross claim to recover from the Robinsons the amount of its liability to the applicant. However, this liability would not extend to the third respondent Robertson Investment Capital, whose only role has been the passive one of lessee of the Broadmoor homestead block.

379 The applicant is entitled to judgment against Kestrel Holdings, Nicolas Robinson and Mantach for damages being the difference between the price paid for Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot and the true value of those properties at the time of purchase as assessed by Mr Austin, together with expenses and interest as detailed above.

380 The claim to set aside the lease of the Broadmoor homestead block is dismissed.</text>

<tocase>Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/8.html</AustLII>
<text>337 In Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241, a claim brought by a financier against the auditors of a borrower corporation, the High Court held that the statement of claim did not disclose a cause of action in negligence against the auditors. Brennan CJ said at 252 
 
 
 ...that mere foreseeability of the possibility that a statement made or advice given by A to B might be communicated to a class of which C is a member and that C might enter into some transaction as the result thereof and suffer financial loss in that transaction is not sufficient to impose on A a duty of care owed to C in the making of the statement or the giving of the advice. 
 
 
 

However his Honour went on to say:
 
 
 But, in every case, it is necessary for the plaintiff to allege and prove that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the information or advice would be communicated to the plaintiff, either individually or as a member of an identified class, that the information or advice would be so communicated for a purpose that would be very likely to lead the plaintiff to enter into a transaction of the kind that the plaintiff does enter into and that it would be very likely that the plaintiff would enter into such a transaction in reliance on the information or advice and thereby risk the incurring of economic loss if the statement should be untrue or the advice should be unsound. If any of these elements be wanting, the plaintiff fails to establish that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in making this statement or giving advice. The statement of claim does not plead these elements.

338 The significance of the pleading in that case was pointed out by Gaudron J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 where her Honour said at [30] that in Esanda : 
 
 
 ...it was not pleaded that the auditors in question knew or ought to have known that a finance provider would rely on their audited statement of accounts and thus, it was held, on the pleadings, that no duty of care was owed by the auditors to the finance provider. 
 
 
 

In the present case that matter has been pleaded in par 39A of the statement of claim.

339 An identified class in the sense used by Brennan CJ would include the class of persons who were clients of Boyds and who had requested Boyds to seek the advice of valuers in relation to these particular properties, where Boyds themselves were providing other financial advice. The circumstance that a Melbourne firm of accountants was seeking valuations of farming properties in Tasmania itself tends to show that the valuations were not being sought by the accountants themselves acting as principals.

340 In Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen [1999] NSWCA 202 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 1 Giles JA said at [17]: 
 
 
 So a valuer who puts out a negligent valuation does not incur an open ended liability to any and every financier who relies on it, even if it was reasonably foreseeable that the financier would rely on it. The particular financier may be outside the class of person to whom the valuer owes a duty to take care in making the statement in the valuation, in the same manner as Esanda was outside the class of persons to whom the auditors owed a duty of care on the case as pleaded in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241; the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel, but not to Esanda.</text>

It was held that the defendant, which brought infected seed potatoes on to a farm in South Australia, owed a duty of care to growers within 20 kilometres of the farm because such persons would be prevented by Western Australian law from exporting potatoes to that State. The plaintiffs "were members of a class whose members, whether numerous or not, were ascertainable by (the defendant)": per McHugh J at [50].</text>

<text>340 In Ta Ho Ma Pty Ltd v Allen [1999] NSWCA 202 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 1 Giles JA said at [17]: 
 
 
 So a valuer who puts out a negligent valuation does not incur an open ended liability to any and every financier who relies on it, even if it was reasonably foreseeable that the financier would rely on it. The particular financier may be outside the class of person to whom the valuer owes a duty to take care in making the statement in the valuation, in the same manner as Esanda was outside the class of persons to whom the auditors owed a duty of care on the case as pleaded in Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords [1997] HCA 8 ; (1997) 188 CLR 241; the auditors owed a duty of care to the members of Excel, but not to Esanda.

341 In Ta Ho Ma an owner of property obtained a valuation from the defendant. Some 81/2 months later the owner telephoned a solicitor (apparently not the owner's own solicitor) seeking a loan and advising of the valuation. The solicitor in turn contacted the plaintiff who advanced a loan on the basis of the defendant's valuation which by this time was 91/2 months old. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff because, having regard to the age of the valuation, there could be no expectation of reasonable reliance by the plaintiff: see per Handley JA at [12]-[14], per Giles JA at [18], [24], [28], per Sheppard AJA at [105].

342 The case is certainly not authority for any proposition that a valuer only owes a duty of care to the client who directly retains him or her. If that were the law, there would have been a short answer to the plaintiff's claim since the chain went from valuer defendant to owner to solicitor to lender plaintiff. On the facts, as Handley JA noted at [6], it was not a case where the valuer contemplated that a class of persons might rely on his valuation. Giles JA at [24] pointed out that where a valuer puts out a negligent valuation the class of persons to whom to whom the duty of care 
 
 
 ...will normally be confined, apart from any other considerations, to those persons whom the valuer knows or ought to know will reasonably rely on the valuation. [Emphasis in original] 
 
 
 
 In other words, given expectation of reasonable reliance, there can be a duty owed by a valuer to a class of persons. The identification of that class will obviously depend on the circumstances.

343 Perre , a decision of the High Court handed down shortly after Ta Ho Ma , demonstrates the flexibility and pragmatism of the law of negligence in identifying the class of persons to whom a duty of care is owed in a particular case and the absence of any bright line rule: see per Gleeson CJ at [7].

<text>348 A disclaimer in almost identical terms was relied on by a valuer defendant in BT Australia Ltd v Raine &amp; Horne Pty Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 221. The first plaintiff (BT) was the trustee of a property trust, the second plaintiff was the custodian trustee of assets of superannuation funds of which BT was manager, and the third plaintiffs were the trustees of various superannuation funds which had invested in the trust. Wootten J at 236 held that the first part of the disclaimer impliedly accepts responsibility for the use of the valuations by BT, but not for its use for any other purpose. The second part disclaimed responsibility to any third party. The second part was to be read as not disclaiming responsibility for damage to a third party by the very use of the valuation by BT for which the valuer in the first part of the clause impliedly accepted responsibility.

349 His Honour noted that the disclaimer clause was unilaterally framed and inserted by the valuer, and if it was intended to disclaim responsibility for the consequences of its use for the very purpose for which it was obtained it was reasonable to expect the valuer to say so in clear words.

350 I think the same conclusion is to be reached in the present case. Also, by a slightly different route it can be said that, construing the clause contra proferentem , "the party to whom it is addressed" comprehends Boyds and also its clients, given the circumstance that, as already discussed, the obvious inference is that the firm is acting on behalf of clients.

351 As to the misleading and deceptive conduct claim ([35]-[38] above) it was submitted that Mr Mantach simply stated what he had done and what he had been told: he had scaled off the map and the owner had instructed him that the area of land used for cropping purposes was 82 ha. His statements of value were expressions of opinion. Valuation, it was said, is an art not a science.</text>

<text>354 In MGICA (1992) Ltd v Kenny &amp; Good Pty Ltd (1996) 140 ALR 313 at 356 ( Kenny at first instance) Lindgren J held that a valuation report in that case conveyed representations not only that the opinions expressed in them were held but also (a) that the opinions were based on reasonable grounds, (b) were the product of the exercise of due care and skill and (c), after making due allowance for their nature as opinions as to the market value of real estate at a particular time, safe to be relied upon and not outside the range of latitude properly to be allowed to them. The same can be said of the Mantach valuations in the present case.</text>

<tocase>Baxter v F W Gapp Co Ltd [1939] 2 KB 271</tocase>
<text>356 The valuations of Mr Austin, which I accept, and even Mr Cripps, establish that there was here a gross overvaluation, which in itself is evidence of negligence: Baxter v F W Gapp Co Ltd [1939] 2 KB 271 at 277, Kenny (at first instance) at 335-337. This is confirmed by what happened when the properties were put up for sale in 2004: [139]-150] above. There were also identifiable errors, especially in the assessment of the croppable areas, but also in the use of some of the comparable sales and the inherently unreliable "catch-all" approach.</text>

<text>145 In June 2004 Mr Medwin submitted a marketing proposal to Mr MacDonald. It stated that Broadmoor had "40 hectares of pine [ sic ] cropping land in a sort [sic] after area" and that at Lower Wilmot "52 hectares is prime cropping land". The proposal gave estimated prices of $600,000 to $650,000 for Broadmoor and $420,000 to $460,000 for Lower Wilmot.

146 The proposal recommended sale by auction with advertising over a five week period in specified Tasmanian newspapers and internet display. In his evidence Mr Medwin defended the length of the advertising campaign, saying 
 
 
 the longer you give purchasers, the more likely they are to procrastinate. Intensive and short advertising campaigns are more likely to attract the market.

147 On 19 June 2004 Mr Medwin received an email from Mr Youl in which Mr Youl calculated the "total cropping area" for Broadmoor as approximately 40 hectares plus probably 5 to 7 hectares taken up with the dam gully, existing dam chemical storage area sheds and access roads, the balance of the 122.43 hectares being existing forest and a small mix of potential cropping land now planted with trees by FEA with the remaining steeper land not suitable for cropping now also planted out with trees. Mr Youl calculated the total cropping area for Lower Wilmot as approximately 60 hectares with the balance of 147.05 hectares taken up with existing forest and non-cropping ground now committed to trees planted by FEA, existing dam areas, ground storage areas, chemical wash down area with evaporation pit, overhead tank and access roads.

367 However, the provision applies only to causes of action that arise on or after the day on which Sch 3 to the amending Act commenced, which was 26 July 2004. Here the cause of action arose in August 2001 when the purchases were completed and the applicant, in exchange for money, acquired properties worth substantially less than their true value. At that moment the applicant suffered actual loss, not just the possibility of future loss, however likely. The case is therefore different from cases of contingent loss such as Wardley and King v Yurisich [2006] FCAFC 136 ; (2006) 153 FCR 78 at [67] .

368 In respect of the claims under ss 14 and 17 (1)(b) of the Fair Trading Act 1990 (Tas), the reduction provision in s 4 of the Wrongs Act 1954 (Tas) would apply. However, if the applicant has a non-reducible claim under the Trade Practices Act , this would have no practical effect.

369 In any case, I see no factual basis for a finding of contributory negligence. As counsel for the applicant fairly put it, his client was firmly in the hands of vendors who were dishonest and professional advisors (ie Mantach) who were negligent. There was nothing to put them on notice as to these dangers. In the resale or attempted resale of the properties, the applicant acted reasonably. It retained Mr Medwin, a very experienced and reputable local agent. The marketing program was, for the reasons explained by Mr Medwin, reasonable and appropriate for properties of this kind [146-150] above.</text>

<text>374 Apportionment between a misleading and deceptive vendor and a negligent professional advisor of a purchaser was the subject of the High Court's decision in Burke v LFOT Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 17 ; (2002) 209 CLR 282. The vendor of a commercial property had made misleading and deceptive representations to a purchaser concerning the reliability and solvency of a tenant of the property. The purchaser was awarded damages of $750,000 being the difference between the price and the true value of the property at the time of purchase. The vendor sought contribution from the purchaser's solicitor who was found to be negligent in not advising the purchaser to inquire about the financial standing of the tenant. The trial judge held that the vendor was entitled to 50 per cent contribution from the solicitor. A majority of the Full Court upheld this order but it was set aside by a majority of the High Court: Gaudron A-CJ, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ, Kirby J dissenting.</text>
