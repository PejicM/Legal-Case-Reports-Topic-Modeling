<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Mutton (1988) 79 ALR 509</tocase>
<text>In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Mutton (1988) 79 ALR 509 at 512 Mahoney JA said: 
 In the end, what the court does when it decides whether there is a 'contrary intention' is to decide whether it was the intention of the legislature that the statutory provision as to interpretation or definition should apply to the particular section: see Gibb v FCT [1966] HCA 74 ; (1966) 118 CLR 628 at 635. The legislative intention may, perhaps, be more easily seen ... where the statutory definition adds to or subtracts from what, apart from the definition, would be the meaning of the particular word in the statutory command: see, eg, R v Brewer [1942] HCA 33 ; (1942) 66 CLR 535 ; YZ Finance Co Pty Ltd v Cummings [1964] HCA 12 ; (1964) 109 CLR 395.

Aided by the 1999 Memorandum, I have determined that the entity referred to in s 152-30(2)(a) as "the other entity" does not include a partnership. Since s 152-30 defines when one entity is connected to another for the purposes of s 152-15(a)(ii), a partnership is not an "entity" for the purposes of par (a)(ii). It follows from the determination that a partnership is not an entity for the purpose of those provisions, that it was not the intention of the legislature that par (d) of the definition of "entity" in s 960-100 should apply to those provisions. Accordingly a contrary intention appears for the purposes of s 995.

I answer the preliminary question: 
 Is a partnership an "entity" within the meaning of that term as used in s 152-15(a)(ii) of the Act? 

 
 No.
