<text>Undoubtedly, where a large number of documents or extensive information is sought within a short period of time, and where an extension of time is not possible, the specification of a short period of time may reflect upon whether the power was exercised in good faith, for a collateral purpose or was unreasonable: see, eg, A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 at [65] per Flick J. In fact, it was alleged that the burden imposed on the applicants was of such a magnitude that no reasonable person exercising the power under s 155 would have made the decisions giving rise to the issue of certain of the Notices. Reliance was placed on the principles stated by Lord Greene MR in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 and s 5(2)(g) of the ADJR Act.</text>

<tocase>Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1458.html</AustLII>
<text>A preliminary attack was made on the use of the concept of point of origin or destination of a service as a reference point able to be used in the Notices. It was contended that the Notices (even if confined to outbound services) did not sufficiently describe a matter involving a contravention of the Act, particularly in failing to describe the market in Australia. I accept that just because services cover the movement of goods in or out of Australia, does not necessarily indicate that there is a relevant market located in Australia in respect of those services: see Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [19] and [21] per Tracey J. However, as I mention later, the Notices when properly construed adequately describe matters capable of involving a contravention of the Act and by reference to a market in Australia.

I make one further observation as to the Notices. The identified matters concern the alleged contravention of s 45 of the Act and concentrate on the supply of the international air cargo services. However, as I have alluded to earlier, it is important to observe that the description of the matters in the Notices concern price fixing as defined by s 45A of the Act, and it is upon that provision attention should be focussed in interpreting the Notices.

Justice Tracey in Auskay FCA 1458 did observe that '[b]uyers and sellers of goods and services must negotiate and enter transactions in an area in which suppliers are engaged in close competition with each other' and '[t]hat area must be located within Australia' (at [19]). However, his Honour also referred to the importance of the place where the relevant competition takes place, and where parties compete to obtain contracts (at [21]). I do not read his Honour's comments (made in the context of a pleading dispute) as dictating that in determinating the geographic location of the market one is confined by the location of the making of the contract for the subject services.

Once it is accepted that the place of contracting is not determinative, then in view of the above reasoning, it cannot be concluded that the particular conduct complained of is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. We are not then dealing with a market that is wholly outside Australia, but rather, with a possible contravention s 45 of the Act in relation to inbound and outbound services in a market in Australia.

Therefore, upon construing the Notices in the manner indicated, I do not regard them as invalid on the ground that the matters the subject of them extend beyond conduct that is capable of constituting a contravention of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1976.html</AustLII>
<text>The notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): 
 Although the notion of a "market in Australia" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. 

 
 In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a "market in Australia" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era.

Justice Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of "market in Australia" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).</text>

<tocase>Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127</tocase>
<text>The principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: 
(a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. 
 
(b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. 
 
(c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J.
 
(d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]).
 
(e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein.
 
(f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J).
 
(g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468):
 
 It is for an applicant to make out its case of "failure to take into account", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them.</text>

<tocase>Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1707.html</AustLII>
<text>I accept that evidence that was not before the decision-maker may be admissible if it is relevant to a particular ground of review, such as unreasonableness: see, eg, Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 , 564-66 per Weinberg J; but see Aronson M, Dyer B, and Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2009) at 256-58. In addition, sometimes it will also be necessary to have established the facts upon which legal issues can be resolved.

In the Singapore Airlines proceeding, the parties filed a statement of agreed facts concerning the supply of international air cargo services, which included the following statements and facts: 
 The following facts are agreed between the parties for the purpose of s 191 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Unless stated otherwise, the facts are applicable as at all relevant times, being the period 1 January 2000 to date. 

 
 1. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) is incorporated in Singapore. 

 SIA supplies international air transport services to passengers on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. The hub of SIA's international passenger services is in Singapore. 
 Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA operated a Cargo Division which supplied air transport services for cargo on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. Air freight is transported either in the 'bellyhold' or lower deck of passenger aircraft or in cargo 'freighters', i.e. planes dedicated to carrying cargo. Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA's Cargo Division supplied international air freight services using both passenger aircraft and cargo freighters. 
 Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd (SIAC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIA. It is incorporated in Singapore. With effect on 1 July 2001, SIA transferred to SIAC the assets, liabilities, cargo-related contracts, operations and business activities of the Cargo Division of SIA. With effect on 3 July 2001, employees of the Cargo Division of SIA ceased to be employed by SIA and were transferred to SIAC. Since that time, only SIAC has supplied international air transport services for cargo within the Singapore Airlines group of companies. 
 SIAC conducts business in 57 countries worldwide including Australia and SIA or SIAC operate aircraft in 38 countries. SIAC or its general sales agents operate out of 76 stations located at international airports to or from which SIAC will carry or arrange for the carriage of cargo. A list of those countries and stations is annexed and marked "A". Each station provides services in relation to the airport at which it is located. 
 In Australia, SIAC currently operates stations at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth international airports. The stations that SIA previously operated at Cairns and at Darwin were closed in March 2001. 
 To supply international air transport services for cargo, SIAC purchases from SIA all non-passenger baggage space in the bellyhold of SIA's passenger airplanes and also operates cargo freighters. The operating fleet of SIAC as at 31 March 2007 comprised 14 B747-400 cargo freighters. SIAC also purchases cargo space from other carriers, or carriage services by road transport operators. Typically SIAC will do this in order to deliver freight to airports which are not serviced by either SIA or SIAC aircraft or to allow stations to access available cargo space on SIA or SIAC aircraft which are operated from another station. 
 Singapore is the main hub and freight distribution centre for SIAC. Charts depicting the routes flown by SIAC freighter aircraft and SIA passenger aircraft as at March 2007 are shown in the routing charts annexed and marked "B". SIAC can offer a freight service from any of its origin ports to Australia, routed through Singapore. 
 The types of freight that are shipped from different countries and different cities can differ substantially. Carriers offer different types of air freight services from different locations in order to meet the requirements of the particular types of freight that are transported from those locations. For example, much of the freight shipped out of Melbourne is perishables such as meat, fruit and vegetables. This type of freight may need to be transported quickly and kept at special temperatures. ... 
 (The annexures referred to above are not annexed to this judgment.)

A substantial amount of additional evidence was adduced by the parties in both proceedings, and the ACCC cross-examined a number of witnesses called by Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Evidence received in each proceeding was to be treated as evidence in the other. Some objections were taken to certain evidence sought to be tendered by the parties, which in light of the approach I adopt, need not be ruled upon. No attack was made upon the credit of any witness, although the ACCC submitted that the evidence was far from conclusive and should not be relied upon as contended for by the applicants.

Some of the evidence was of a confidential nature and appropriate orders were made under ss 17 and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In giving these reasons for judgment I have not found it necessary to refer to this evidence other than in a general way.

The primary purpose of the evidence led was to provide the factual background concerning the markets in which international air cargo services are ordinarily supplied. Such evidence was said to support the argument that the Court could be satisfied that international air cargo services on routes into Australia, and between two points outside Australia, are not competitively provided in a market in Australia. Evidence was also led concerning what became known as the 'burden issue'. That evidence dealt with the steps required to be taken by Singapore Airlines and Emirates to comply with some of the notices. It also concerned the manner and extent to which Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the recipients, and what considerations he took into account in deciding to issue the Notices.</text>

<tocase>Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/156.html</AustLII>
<text>There is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): 
 The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: 

 
 (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: 

 (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and 
 
 (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: 
 
Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. 
 
 
 (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information "relating" to one or more "matters" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary "relatedness" is not to be approached in an "over-technical or hypercritical way": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the "relatedness" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. 

 
 (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have "reason to believe" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. 

 
 (iv) The word "matter" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words "may constitute" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not "idly speculate" or "draw on improbable circumstances" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may "reasonably be suspected" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. 

 
 (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an "over-technical or hypercritical approach" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice "plead" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. 

 
 (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180.

This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74

If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333.</text>

<text>As a prefatory matter, a few words must be directed to the question of the reach of the Act. Initially, it appeared that these proceedings were going to concern the extent to which the Act extended to extraterritorial conduct. It has long been accepted in the United States that a court may assert jurisdiction under the Sherman Act 15 USC &#167; 1 for anticompetitive conduct occurring wholly outside the territory of the United States, provided that the conduct has effects felt in the United States: see F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v Empagran S.A. [2004] USSC 2381 ; 542 US 155 (2004); Hartford Fire Insurance Co v California [1993] USSC 100 ; 509 US 764 (1993). That s 45 of the Act should be read similarly, at least with respect to corporations carrying on business in Australia, was considered by Merkel J in Bray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd [2002] FCA 243 ; (2002) 118 FCR 1 , at 15-16, and affirmed by the Full Court in Bray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317.</text>

In any event, for the reasons I have already given, whilst the burden of some of the Notices, having regard to the original time limit, was objectively harsh and oppressive, the decision to issue such Notices was not so unreasonable (or illogical or irrational) that it could not have been made in the circumstances. Even if I looked to the question of 'proportionally', it seems to me that having regard to the very nature, breadth and extent of the investigation, the consequences of the burden were not such as to demonstrate unreasonableness so as to impugn the decision: see discussion in Bruce 45 NSWLR 163, at 184-5 per Spigelman CJ. I would reach this conclusion even on the basis of the evidence sought to be tendered by the applicants on the burden issue, although its relevance may be questionable&#8212;see above [13].

A final point was raised by the ACCC that if the applicants succeeded only in relation to their arguments on burden, I should not grant the relief sought as the initial time frame for the Notices in contention has been extended by a variation to the Notices. That such variations have occurred is not in contention.

The only attack of the applicants is on the decision to issue the Notices and the Notices in their original form. No complaint is now made as to the extended time frame, there being no attack on the decisions varying the Notices.</text>

<tocase>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453</tocase>
<text>The principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: 
(a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. 
 
(b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. 
 
(c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J.
 
(d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]).
 
(e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein.
 
(f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J).
 
(g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468):

<text>There was no direct evidence from Mr Samuel that he had regard to the burden imposed on the applicants when deciding to issue the Notices. In proceedings of this nature I would not expect Mr Samuel to provide direct evidence: see eg Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 at [116] per Jacobsen J. The only available evidence suggesting that Mr Samuel might have taken into account the effect of issuing the Notices on the applicants is derived from the Reason to Believe papers, and the objective matters available to Mr Samuel at the time of the issuing of the Notices, including the Notices themselves.

Many identical s 155 notices were issued at the same time to many airlines. The Reason to Believe papers seemed to be prepared in standard form for each such notice. This also applied to the 'burden' of the Notices. No allowance seems to have been made for the different burden that may have been imposed on different airlines by reason of the fact that their operations differed in scale and geographic scope.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1980/94.html</AustLII>
<text>It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ).

It is important to keep in mind that it is an investigative power which is under consideration in these proceedings. As stated by the Full Court in Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd [1980] FCA 94 ; 47 FLR 163 (at 174): 
 The investigative power may properly be exercised by inquiring into the existence of facts which do not themselves constitute a contravention or deny the possibility of a contravention. The power may properly be exercised to ascertain facts which may merely indicate a further line of inquiry, or which may tend to prove circumstances from which an inference can be drawn as to the existence of other facts which have a more immediate and proximate relationship to the matter under investigation.

The applicants are involved in international activities, and decisions and discussions concerning the matter under investigation may readily be accepted as having occurred overseas, as well as in Australia. The conduct of the applicants wherever occurring could be relevant to the investigation of the matter as defined in the Notices. It is not for this Court to confine or restrict the course of an investigation if the powers conferred by s 155 have not been exceeded.

In relation to the interpretation of the Notices, the applicants allege that the definition of 'Fuel Surcharge' is wide and unclear. However, to the extent that the applicants have responded to the Notices, they appear to have had no difficulty at all in understanding the meaning of the term. It seems to me that the applicants should be, and in fact are, well versed in the concept of 'Fuel Surcharge'.</text>

<text>The principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: 
(a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision.

Similarly, Mason J in Peko Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; 162 CLR 24 said (at 40): 
 The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: ( Wednesbury Corporation , at 228).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>It seems to me that the 'burden' sections of the Reason to Believe papers were pro-forma statements. This is not necessarily to be unexpected. The use of such standard paragraphs is not fatal in itself. However, if a verbal formula is used 'to cloak the decision with the appearance of conformity with the law', the use of that formula will not save the decision from invalidity: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 266 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

The 'burden' sections of the Rason to Believe papers in dealing with the time for compliance specifically refer to the magnitude of the burden imposed and to the time in which the recipient could provide the information and documents. Consideration was then given to the burden generally and, specifically, to the time in which a recipient would need to make the necessary searches and enquiries, collate the material necessary and obtain legal advice. Significantly, Mr Samuel was reminded that he needed to consider the magnitude of the burden. This indicates that the Reason to Believe papers did not contain the only information relied upon by Mr Samuel, although they contained recommendations.

I am not satisfied that the requirement to comply within a certain limited time was imposed without regard to the ultimate burden which it would impose on the recipient, even on the facts as I have found as to the burden objectively imposed.</text>

<text>In the operation of s 45 of the Act, a key concept is 'market'. There is a plethora of case law regarding the meaning of that term, but the High Court has warned that attempts to define 'market' too precisely are dangerous. In NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority (2004) 219 CLR 90 , the High Court advocated a broader approach, stating (at 117): 
 The Act is seeking to advance the broad goal of promoting competition. Certain provisions of the Act, particularly in Pt IV, necessarily turn to a significant degree on expressions which are not precise or formally exact. One example is "market": there can be overlapping markets with blurred limits and disagreements between bona fide and reasonable experts about their definition, as in this case. Other examples are "substantial", "competition", "arrangement", "understanding", "purpose" and "reason" (which need only be a "substantial" purpose or reason: s 4F). It is not appropriate to subject the application of this type of legislation to a process of anatomising, filleting and dissecting... .

<text>As observed by Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460 , '[t]he power [under s 155] is a drastic power and is capable of abuse and must be exercised with care' (at 468). The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1982/17.html</AustLII>
<text>There is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): 
 The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: 

 
 (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: 

 (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and 
 
 (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: 
 
Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. 
 
 
 (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information "relating" to one or more "matters" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary "relatedness" is not to be approached in an "over-technical or hypercritical way": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the "relatedness" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. 

 
 (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have "reason to believe" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. 

 
 (iv) The word "matter" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words "may constitute" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not "idly speculate" or "draw on improbable circumstances" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may "reasonably be suspected" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. 

 
 (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an "over-technical or hypercritical approach" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice "plead" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. 

 
 (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180.

This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74

If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333.

It then remains to address the application of the principles enunciated in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 . Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ there observed (at 377-8): 
 There remains to be considered the availability to the appellants of the grounds upon which they object to a particular requirement to produce documents, namely, that it is harsh, oppressive and unreasonable. 

 
 The mere fact that compliance with a requirement to furnish information or to produce documents would be burdensome will not invalidate that requirement in a s.155 notice (see Melbourne Home of Ford v Trade Practices Commission (No. 3) ; Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman ). Nor will objective harshness, unreasonableness or oppressiveness of a requirement in such a notice constitute an independent ground of invalidity. If invalidity by reference to these qualities is to be established, it must be by reference to the implied general limitation upon the power conferred by s 155(1) of the Act to which reference has already been made, namely, that it is a condition of a valid exercise of the power that it be used in good faith for the purpose for which it was conferred and with regard to the effect that the exercise of the power will have upon those affected thereby. It is only if the harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness of a requirement in a s 155 notice is, in all the circumstances, such as to warrant the conclusion that the requirement could not have been imposed in good faith or could only have been imposed to achieve a collateral purpose or without regard to the burden which it would impose upon the recipient, that harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness will result in invalidity. 
 (Emphasis added, citations omitted.)

I have already concluded that Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the applicants. It now remains to consider the question of good faith, and a possible separate issue of unreasonableness. To a certain extent, the issues of failing to take into account the burden, good faith and unreasonableness overlap. Obviously, a requirement may be harsh, unreasonable and oppressive, and still not result in invalidity.

As observed by Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460 , '[t]he power [under s 155] is a drastic power and is capable of abuse and must be exercised with care' (at 468). The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further.

I now turn to the separate ground relied upon of unreasonableness. It may be that the concept of unreasonableness is caught within the principles of Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368. Nevertheless, I do not consider that approaching the matter on the basis of unreasonableness, even if a separate ground to consider apart from the approach taken in Pyneboard , further advances the arguments of the applicants in support of their applications.</text>

<text>In addition Dawson J observed in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 (at 198-99): 
 Lying behind both of those questions is the concept of the market, a concept which is sometimes dealt with in a more complex manner than is necessary. A market is an area in which the exchange of goods or services between buyer and seller is negotiated. It is sometimes referred to as the sphere within which price is determined and that serves to focus attention upon the way in which the market facilitates exchange by employing price as the mechanism to reconcile competing demands for resources: see Stigler and Sherwin, "The Extent of the Market", (1985) 28 Journal of Law and Economics vol 28 (1985) 555 at p. 555. In setting the limits of a market the emphasis has historically been placed upon what is referred to as the "demand side", but more recently the "supply side" has also come to be regarded as significant. The basic test involves the ascertainment of the cross-elasticities of both supply and demand, that is to say, the extent to which the supply of or demand for a product responds to a change in the price of another product. Cross-elasticities of supply and demand reveal the degree to which one product may be substituted for another, an important consideration in any definition of a market. This is reflected in s 4E of the Trade Practices Act which provides: 

 
"For the purposes of this Act, 'market' means a market in Australia and, when used in relation to any goods or services, includes a market for those goods or services and other goods or services that are substitutable for, or otherwise competitive with , the first-mentioned goods or services" (My emphasis.)
 
 
 Important as they are, elasticities and the notion of substitution provide no complete solution to the definition of a market. A question of degree is involved &#8212; at what point do different goods become closely enough linked in supply or demand to be included in the one market &#8212; which precludes any dogmatic answer. See Times-Picayune v United States .

<text>Any separate allegation of unreasonableness, particularly in the statutory context of s 155 of the Act, needs to be approached with caution. As Gleeson CJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [5] : 
 ... to describe reasoning as illogical, or unreasonable, or irrational, may merely be an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with it. If it is suggested that there is a legal consequence, it may be necessary to be more precise as to the nature and quality of the error attributed to the decision-maker, and to identify the legal principle or statutory provision that attracts the suggested consequence.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1978/9.html</AustLII>
<text>In my view, the Court does have a discretion to refuse relief in such circumstances, even to the extent the application is brought under s 163A of the Act: see, eg, Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314.

As I have said, time for compliance has been extended. This time frame is not in dispute. Documents have been delivered by the applicants to the ACCC by reason of some or all of the Notices. The applicants did not challenge the decision to issue the Notices or the Notices before supplying those documents. Some delay occurred before the applicants brought their applications in this Court. There is no suggestion that any prosecution is intended based upon the Notices and the original time frame for compliance. These would all be reasons for refusing as a matter of discretion the substantive relief sought by the applicants.

In view of the above reasons, the applications should be dismissed. I will make orders to facilitate the parties reaching an agreement as to costs. In the event that no agreement is reached, then orders will be made as to the exchange of submissions on the issue of costs.

<tocase>Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1608.html</AustLII>
<text>The notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): 
 Although the notion of a "market in Australia" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. 

 
 In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a "market in Australia" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era.

In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services).

However, I do not take the reference by Hill J to a global market which includes Australia as arguably a market in Australia 'if sales are made [in Australia]' ([2002] FCA 1608 at [22] ) as making it a requirement that the contract under which services are supplied in Australia must be entered into in Australia or that the transactions themselves must be entered into in Australia. In my view, Hill J was simply proffering an example of how one might identify the possible location of competition, and was not providing a definitive statement that buyers and sellers of services must enter into transactions in Australia.</text>

<text>Justice Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of "market in Australia" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).</text>

<tocase>S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357</tocase>
<text>At the outset I indicate that 'as a matter of logic and without the necessity to have all of the facts' it may be concluded in any given case that particular conduct is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act: see S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 377 per Wilcox J. Evidence may be admitted to show conclusively that, even without all of the facts, the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice would not be capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. However, evidence could not be led to show that there is in fact no contravention, assuming the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice was capable of constituting a contravention of the Act.

It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ).

The applicants' evidence does not eliminate (as it must) any reasonable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the contention that the market is wholly outside Australia even if one focuses on the inbound services in isolation: see S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 370 and Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at [9] and [52]. There are many reasons for this, but I provide a non-exhaustive list:</text>

<tocase>Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/267.html</AustLII>
<text>There is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): 
 The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: 

 
 (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: 

 (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and 
 
 (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: 
 
Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. 
 
 
 (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information "relating" to one or more "matters" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary "relatedness" is not to be approached in an "over-technical or hypercritical way": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the "relatedness" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. 

 
 (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have "reason to believe" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. 

 
 (iv) The word "matter" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words "may constitute" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not "idly speculate" or "draw on improbable circumstances" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may "reasonably be suspected" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. 

 
 (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. 

 
 (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an "over-technical or hypercritical approach" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice "plead" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. 

 
 (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180.

This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74

The correct starting point is to determine whether the matters identified in the Notices are incapable, after allowing for undiscovered facts, of constituting a contravention of s 45 of the Act by reference to the deeming provision of s 45A. As noted by Sackville and Emmett JJ in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 '[u]ltimately, the question is whether the matter identified in the Notices "may constitute" a contravention of the [Act]' (at 184).

The substantial challenge to the decision to issue the Notices, and to the Notices themselves, seized upon this concept of 'matter'; specifically, Emirates argued that the Notices should be set aside because they: 
 relate to, and purport to require [the applicants] to furnish information and produce documents relating to, matters that cannot constitute a contravention of s 45(2) of the [Act] . Those matters concern alleged agreements or understandings relating to the supply of air cargo services on routes into Australia and routes between two or more points outside Australia. Such services are not supplied in competition in a market in Australia. By virtue of s 45(3) and 4E of the [Act] , it is only services supplied in competition in a market in Australia that can possibly found a contravention of s 45(2). 

Singapore Airlines essentially made the same submission.

It was accepted by Emirates and Singapore Airlines that the evidence adduced in these proceedings was not intended to, nor would it enable, the Court to conclude whether all international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or in many different markets and the boundaries of those markets. It was said by Emirates, at least, that: 
(a) the Notices allege an arrangement containing provisions that fix the price of international air cargo services supplied by the parties throughout the world;
 
(b) regardless of whether a conclusion is ultimately reached that international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or many different markets, the supply of those services outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia cannot occur in a market in Australia within the meaning of the Act;
 
(c) in so far as the alleged arrangement contained a provision fixing the price of international air cargo services supplied outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia, it does not satisfy the elements of s 45A; and
 
(d) the conclusion in para (c) holds regardless of whether the parties to the arrangement also supply international air cargo services of the same kind in Australia to acquirers in Australia.

It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ).

The applicants' evidence does not eliminate (as it must) any reasonable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the contention that the market is wholly outside Australia even if one focuses on the inbound services in isolation: see S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 370 and Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at [9] and [52].

<text>In Singapore Airlines Ltd v Taprobane Tours WA Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 621 ; (1991) 33 FCR 158 French J (Spender and O'Loughlin JJ agreeing) said in relation to market identification (at 174): 
 In competition law it has a descriptive and a purposive role. It involves fact finding together with evaluative and purposive selection. In any given application it describes a range of economic activities defined by reference to particular economic functions (eg manufacturing, wholesale or retail sales), the class or classes of products, be they goods or services, which are the subject of those activities and the geographic area within which those activities occur. In its statutory setting the market designation imposes, on the activities which it encompasses, limits set by the law for the protection of competition. It involves a choice of the relevant range of activity by reference to economic and commercial realities and the policy of the statute. To the extent that it must serve statutory policy, the identification will be evaluative and purposive as well as descriptive.</text>

<tocase>Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323</tocase>
<text>The principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: 
(a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. 
 
(b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. 
 
(c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J.
 
(d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]).
 
(e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein.
 
(f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J).
 
(g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468):
 
 It is for an applicant to make out its case of "failure to take into account", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them.</text>

<text>Then in Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1979) 40 FLR 83 Fisher J said (at 111): 
 The Trade Practices Tribunal considered the concept of market in some detail in Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (1975-6) 8 ALR 481 at 517, where the members said: "A market is the area of close competition between firms or, putting it a little differently, the field of rivalry between them. ... Within the bounds of a market there is substitution substitution between one product and another, and between one source of supply and another, in response to changing prices. So a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive".

It is significant to note that consideration must be given to both actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers in identifying the 'field of rivalry' between competitors.</text>
