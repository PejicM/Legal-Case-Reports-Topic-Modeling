<tocase>Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory On The Relation of Olaseat Pty Ltd v The Australian Capital Territory Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning (1993) 43 FCR 329</tocase>
<text>65 Although Mr Hahnheuser has pleaded reliance on s 45DD(3) of the Trade Practices Act in his amended defence, there is a question whether he is entitled to rely on that provision when he has not participated in the trial of the proceeding. In other words, there is a question as to whether the onus of proof of the elements of s 45DD(3) falls on the person seeking to rely on it, or whether the party contending that a contravention of s 45DB(1) has occurred carries the onus of proving that the elements of s 45DD(3) did not exist. The resolution of this question must lie in ascertaining the intention of the legislature from the provisions of the legislation. Often, the fact that a provision is expressed as an exception to a general provision, whether or not it appears in the same section as the general provision, will be a significant indicator that the onus lies on the party seeking to take advantage of the exception. This is not a conclusive rule. See Vines v Djordjevitch [1955] HCA 19 ; (1955) 91 CLR 512 at 519 and Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory On The Relation of Olaseat Pty Ltd v The Australian Capital Territory Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning (1993) 43 FCR 329 at 335-336.</text>

<tocase>Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia (1991) 32 FCR 318</tocase>
<text>31 So far as the evidence goes, the acts of the persons accompanying Mr Hahnheuser were not identical to those of Mr Hahnheuser. He appears to have been the one mixing the ham and water, and the one placing the ham and tainted water in places from which the sheep would be expected to feed. Mr Hahnheuser was the one who gave the television interviews. The evidence does not disclose that any of the other persons did any of these things. There may be cases in which different people perform different acts, all directed towards achieving the same end, but the differences are so great as to prevent the conduct of the different persons being described accurately as conduct "in concert". See the discussion in Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia (1991) 32 FCR 318 at 328-329 per Gray J. Nevertheless, in the present case, the extent of the collaboration is sufficient to support a finding that Mr Hahnheuser and at least one of the persons with him were engaging in conduct in concert. An integral part of the end that they sought to achieve was that there should be proof of the adulteration of the sheep feed, so that the shipment of the consignment of sheep could not go ahead and there would be media coverage, informing the public of the frustration of the attempt to ship those sheep to the Middle East. Thus, recording the videos was an essential part of the conduct. Mr Hahnheuser was assisted in making his point in some of the interviews by the other person holding signs so that they would be visible to the television camera. The result is that at least one other person was actively assisting Mr Hahnheuser to achieve the end that he sought, and was doing so by practical means calculated to complement the acts of Mr Hahnheuser. This fact justifies the finding that there were two persons acting in concert to perform the conduct complained of, and that one of them was Mr Hahnheuser.</text>

<text>30 Mr Hahnheuser was the principal actor in the three episodes that made up the conduct. He was the one mixing the ham and water in the bathroom, putting the mixture into the water container, distributing the ham and tainted water in the feedlot and giving the interviews. His name appears on the Press Alert. He did not act alone, however. At least one other person was present in the bathroom at the motel, to operate the video camera. At least two other persons were present with Mr Hahnheuser in the feedlot, one operating the video camera and one shown in the video walking with Mr Hahnheuser, wearing a tee-shirt similar to that worn by Mr Hahnheuser. In some of the television interviews, there are two people shown standing behind Mr Hahnheuser, holding up signs shaped like animals, with slogans written on them. The person whose name was given as Diana Simpson made the booking for the motel room used, and was present at the time. The person whose name was given as Mark Pearson paid for the room. The name Mark Pearson also appears on the Press Alert. In the course of his interviews, Mr Hahnheuser made admissions that there were other persons with him in the feedlot. He described what had happened as an operation that was carefully designed and planned, involving detailed investigations in advance and reconnaissance over a number of days, and as being "highly organised". It is clear that the other persons involved were willing participants; there is nothing to suggest that they were coerced, so as to prevent them from being taken to have acted in concert with Mr Hahnheuser. See Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55 at 61-63. The activities of Mr Hahnheuser and the other persons with him had the element of contemporaneousness sometimes said to be necessary for a finding of conduct in concert to be made.

<tocase>Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited (1993) 42 FCR 452</tocase>
<text>45 What s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act requires is that trade or commerce be prevented or substantially hindered. It appears to be accepted generally that "hindering" in this context must be given a broad meaning, so that it conveys in any way affecting to an appreciable extent the ease of the usual way of performing the activity concerned. The authorities are referred to in Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers &#8722; Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited (1993) 42 FCR 452 at 459-460 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ, especially the passage quoted there from the judgment of Mason CJ in Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; (1991) 172 CLR 32 at 45-46. There is no suggestion in the present case that the ease with which Rural Export ensured the supply of feed to the feedlot was affected in a negative way to any extent. It simply had to do more of what it would normally have been required to do, during a longer period than it would have been required to do it. It is possible that Rural Export's capacity to do other things in conducting its trade or commerce might have been affected by the need to spend extra time ordering and directing the delivery of extra feed. There is no evidence to this effect, however. It is said that Rural Export had to spend more money on feed than it otherwise would have in respect of this consignment of sheep. On that basis, it appears to me that the only way in which it could be said that Rural Export's trade or commerce has been hindered would be if it were to be accepted that being obliged to spend more money and to carry out the actions necessary to order and procure the delivery of further feed, in order for Rural Export to discharge its responsibilities with respect to the particular consignment of sheep, amounts to having its trade or commerce hindered. This may require an expansion of the concept of hindering beyond that with which the authorities seem to deal. As the authorities stand, I am unable to say that the trade or commerce of Rural Export was hindered, whether substantially or otherwise.</text>

<tocase>Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/290.html</AustLII>
<text>48 The only other relevant authority appears to be Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk (No 2) [2005] FCA 1307. That case involved an attempt to strike out a statement of claim in which reliance was placed on s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act , among other causes of action. Hely J struck out those parts of the statement of claim based on s 45DB. The relevant passages in his Honour's judgment are found at [56]-[65] and cast light on the question of interpretation that arises in the present case. It is not clear from the reasons for judgment what trade or commerce the applicants in that case carried on. Reference to an earlier judgment in the same proceeding, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 at [1] and [3], reveals those applicants to have been a corporation claiming to represent some 30,000 Australian woolgrowers, and persons or companies who were Australian woolgrowers represented by that corporation. In Australian Wool Innovation (No 2) at [57], Hely J pointed out that about 95 per cent of the annual production of Australian wool is exported to places outside Australia. The respondents in that case were alleged to be conducting a campaign against a practice known as mulesing, a practice involving the surgical removal of folds of skin in the breech of a ewe as a measure against flystrike. At [57], his Honour described this as a campaign that could be seen as conduct designed to hinder or prevent the export of Australian wool. His Honour said:
 On a broad reading of s 45DB , conduct which prevents an export sale of wool is at least arguably conduct which prevents the putative vendor from engaging in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia because, as a result of the frustration of the intended sale, there will be no movement of those goods overseas.

50 As his Honour pointed out at [59], the original form in which s 45DB(1) passed through the House of Representatives contained a prohibition on persons, acting in concert, from engaging in conduct where the purpose and effect or likely effect of the conduct was to prevent or substantially hinder a third person from engaging in trade or commerce between Australia and other countries, among the States and Territories or within a Territory. The final form of the provision resulted from an amendment sponsored jointly by the Government and the Australian Democrats, and moved in the Senate. The form of the amendment appears to have provoked some controversy, because a document recording arguments of the Government in favour of the amendment was incorporated into the parliamentary record (Australia, Senate, Debates , (1996) Vol S180, p 5606). That document contained the following passage, which Hely J quoted in Australian Wool Innovation (No 2) at [60]:
 Some concern has been expressed that the provision, as amended, still imposes a very broad prohibition on conduct that constitutes a primary or second boycott. The concern appears to be based on a view that the expression "trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia" covers a very broad range of activities, because a great many manufacturing and distribution operations have some connection with the export of goods. 
 
 The concern is ill-founded. The intention of this amendment is that the prohibition in section 45DB will not apply in respect of the production and distribution of goods within Australia. 
 
 The boycott conduct that the section is designed to prohibit is conduct that has been undertaken for a particular purpose and which has, or is likely to have, a particular effect. The purpose and effect of the conduct must be to prevent or substantially hinder a third person from engaging in a particular type of trade or commerce. That is, trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia. In this context, the use of the expression "trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia" does not mean merely that the trade or commerce affected includes the movement of goods into or out of Australia, or that the movement of goods into or out of Australia forms some part of, or is related to, the trade and commerce. Rather, it means that the trade or commerce that is affected must entail, or be rolled up with, the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia.

51 In addition, at [61], Hely J quoted from the speech of Senator Murray, a joint mover of the amendment motion, in the following terms:
 These amendments represent a signification modification of the original bill ... Instead of a general prohibition on primary boycotts affecting trade and commerce, the prohibition will extend only to trade and commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside it. This provision will pick up only the act of movement; it will not pick up any other aspect of trade and commerce. 
 
 Some commentators have suggested that it will pick up any aspect of trade and commerce if some aspect of that trade and commerce were to involve the movement of goods. I wish to state categorically, as a joint mover of the motion, that this is clearly not the intention of that provision. This provision is targeted purely and solely at movement, at shipping, for example. The reason for that is that primary boycotts on the wharves affect many other people. The effect is not limited to the immediate parties involved. If the waterside workers refuse to load perishable goods, the supplying factory might be forced to suspend operations and stand down workers, resulting in innocent employers and employees being hurt.

52 At [62], Hely J expressed the view that it was clear that s 45DB(1) as enacted was intended to have a much narrower field of operation than the form originally proposed. At [63]-[64], his Honour rejected an argument that the provision was ambiguous and might, on one view, be broad enough to encompass the claim made. His Honour decided to resolve the question of construction then and there, rather than to leave it to the trial. He expressed the view that the words "involving the movement of goods" are "obviously words of limitation intended to narrow what would otherwise have been the scope of the s 45DB prohibition." It is noteworthy that his Honour appears to have regarded the issue as so clear as to warrant the striking out of the claim.

53 In the present case, counsel for the applicants objected to reliance being placed on the parliamentary materials on which Hely J relied. The objection was obviously untenable. Section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) permits the use of material not forming part of an Act if that material is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision. Among the material specified in s 15AB(2) as materials that may be considered are:
 (e) any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the 
 provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or 
 furnished to the members of, either House of the Parliament by a 
 Minister before the time when the provision was enacted; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and 
 Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record 
 of debates in the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.

54 In a case such as the present, the history of a provision can be of great importance in construing its meaning. It is possible to see, as Hely J did, that the operation of the provision has been narrowed substantially when compared with the form in which it was first passed by the House of Representatives and transmitted to the Senate. It is significant that the amendment proposed was supported by the Government. The document incorporated into Hansard, on which Hely J relied, falls squarely within s 15AB(2)(e) and the remarks of Senator Murray, a joint mover of the amendment, fall within s 15AB(2)(h).

55 I respectfully adopt Hely J's reasoning in relation to s 45DB(1). His Honour's judgment was a considered one. To the extent to which Hely J's view is inconsistent with the views of Drummond J in F H Transport and Sackville J in Farah , Hely J's view is to be preferred. There is nothing in the reasons of Drummond J and Sackville J in those two cases to show that their Honours even considered the possibility that the words "involving the movement of goods" should be regarded as narrowing the operation of s 45DB(1), or that either of them considered the parliamentary materials.</text>

<tocase>Farah (Australia) Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers NSW Branch (No 1) (1997) ATPR 41-583</tocase>
<text>47 In this respect, there is some authority, which may shed light on the meaning of s 45DB(1). In F H Transport Pty Ltd v Transport Workers' Union of Australia (1997) 75 FCR 480, Drummond J considered whether to grant an interlocutory injunction to restrain industrial action interfering with the delivery of goods to, and the collecting of goods from, terminals operated by several transport companies. The interlocutory injunction was sought on a number of grounds, including alleged contravention of s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act . At 490, his Honour suggested, in a single sentence, that the existence of evidence that part of one transport company's activities involve the movement of containers committed to international trade showed that there was a strong arguable case of infringement of s 45DB. His Honour did not discuss specifically whether the trade or commerce of a transport company, being the carriage of containers by road, was trade or commerce "involving" the movement of goods between Australia and a place outside Australia. He appears to have assumed that this was so. In Farah (Australia) Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers NSW Branch (No 1) (1997) ATPR 41-583, Sackville J rejected a claim for an interlocutory injunction, which was based on s 45D(1) and s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act . In that case, a picket line was preventing the delivery of goods to premises in Sydney, occupied by an importer and wholesale distributor of clothing products, some of which were manufactured in Fiji. At 44,066-44,067, his Honour expressed a tentative view that there was not a serious issue to be tried in relation to s 45DB(1) , because there was little or nothing in the evidence suggesting that any of those involved in the picket had in mind the purpose of preventing or substantially hindering the Fijian supplier from engaging in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia. His Honour did express the view that the evidentiary position may change on a final hearing. It therefore appears that his Honour took the view that it was at least possible that the Fijian manufacturer and exporter to Australia was engaged in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods from a place outside Australia to Australia.

55 I respectfully adopt Hely J's reasoning in relation to s 45DB(1). His Honour's judgment was a considered one. To the extent to which Hely J's view is inconsistent with the views of Drummond J in F H Transport and Sackville J in Farah , Hely J's view is to be preferred.

<tocase>Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131</tocase>
<text>72 The amended statement of claim contained an alternative allegation of trespass to Samex's sheep, said to have been constituted by entering the feedlot and placing pig meat in the feeding and drinking systems. Counsel for the applicants made no submission on this trespass claim. This is probably because trespass to goods is limited to direct and immediate interference with possession of a chattel. Although owned by Samex, the sheep concerned were in Mr Peddie's possession at the time when Mr Hahnheuser engaged in his conduct. Further, there is no evidence that Mr Hahnheuser interfered directly with the sheep. There is an obvious distinction between direct interference of the kind required to constitute a trespass and leaving something that sheep might or might not choose to eat in a place where they might or might not choose to go for the purpose of eating. It has been held that laying baits for dogs, which were subsequently taken by the dogs of a passing drover of sheep, did not amount to trespass to the dogs. See Hutchins v Maughan [1947] VLR 131. Indeed, the evidence, so far as it goes was that there was untouched matter found in at least one of the feeding troughs, which the sheep had apparently chosen not to eat. Whether any sheep actually ingested any adulterated feed must remain a matter of speculation.

73 For reasons I have already stated in [3], there must be an order dismissing the application as against the second respondent, with no order as to costs. That order is made by consent of the applicants and the second respondent. As a result of the conclusions I have reached, there must also be an order dismissing the application as against Mr Hahnheuser. In my view, there should be no order as to costs. In particular, costs should not follow the event because Mr Hahnheuser received the benefit of pro bono legal representation (not organised through the legal referral scheme operated by the Court under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules ) until he declined to avail himself of it any further. It is not even altogether clear that the Court would have any power to award costs in his favour in those circumstances.

74 I should also say that, if I had been satisfied that there had been a contravention of s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act , I should certainly not have been prepared to make a declaration, or to grant an injunction, in any of the forms specified in either of the application or the applicants' outline of argument. All of the suggested forms of both orders are inadequate to specify with the precision necessary the conduct in which Mr Hahnheuser has engaged or the conduct he would be required to refrain from engaging in. It is unnecessary to say more than that.</text>

<tocase>Pollard v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 659</tocase>
<text>56 The view expressed by Hely J, that s 45DB(1) does not apply to acts anterior to the movement of goods from Australia to a place outside Australia, is consistent with dictionary definitions of the word "involving" and authorities dealing with the use of that word in other statutory contexts. The Macquarie Dictionary (revised edition) defines "involve" relevantly as follows: "to include as a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence; imply; entail" and "to include, contain or comprehend within itself or its scope." The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition) defines "involve" relevantly as: "to enfold, envelop, entangle, include"; "to include; to contain, imply"; and "to contain implicitly; to include as a necessary (and therefore unexpressed) feature, circumstance, antecedent condition, or consequence; to imply, entail." In Rimanic v Business Licensing Authority [2001] VSC 400 , Habersberger J had to consider whether a conviction for making a threat to kill was a conviction "of an offence involving violence", disqualifying a person from obtaining a licence as a motor car trader. At [19], his Honour referred to dictionary definitions. At [45]-[46], his Honour referred to Pollard v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 659, in which the question was whether certain statutory offences were offences "involving fraud or dishonesty". In Pollard , the argument that such an offence was limited to an offence "of" fraud or dishonesty was rejected, on the basis that the substitution of the word "of" for the word "involving" would fail to give the relevant provision its ordinary meaning. At [48], Habersberger J expressed the view that an offence involving violence is something less than an offence of violence, relying on Pollard . Relying on R v McCrossen [1991] Tas R 1, his Honour also expressed the view that an offence involving violence is also something less than an offence one of the essential ingredients of which is violence. As one of the relevant meanings of the word "involving" was "implying", and a threat to kill implied violence, a threat to kill was an offence involving violence.</text>

<text>59 In Queensland v Murphy [1990] HCA 42 ; (1990) 95 ALR 493 at 498, the High Court commented on the ordinary meaning of the term "environment" as follows:
 In its ordinary meaning "environment" signifies that which surrounds and has long been understood to include "the conditions under which any person or thing lives": Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed (1989). The latter usage dates from 1827 when Thomas Carlyle used the word to mean "the aggregate of external circumstances, conditions, and things that affect the existence and development of an individual, organism, or group". See Hendrickson, The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, (1987).

60 There can be little doubt that "environmental protection" means the protection of the environment. There is nothing in s 45DD(3) of the Trade Practices Act to indicate that the word "environmental" is used in a more narrow sense than its ordinary meaning. Indeed, the legislative history of the Act by which s 45DD was inserted into the Trade Practices Act (the same Act as that which inserted s 45DB) suggests to the contrary. Like s 45DB(1) in its present form, s 45DD(3) was the subject of an amendment moved in the Senate jointly by the Government and the Australian Democrats. One of the joint movers, Senator Murray, told the Senate:
 In drafting exclusions, the Democrats have opted not to define what is meant by environmental protection or consumer protection. It is our clear intention in moving these amendments that the clauses be interpreted broadly. (Australia, Senate, Debates , (1996) Vol S180, p 5608).

61 Senator Murray then referred to the High Court's application of the natural and ordinary meaning of "environment" in Murphy , and went on to state that "environmental protection" in the proposed legislation would:
 extend to environmental issues affecting indigenous people, such as the protection of sacred sites. It would extend to urban environment issues and pollution issues. It would extend to environment issues such as preservation of historic buildings. It should and will be interpreted very broadly. It would include boycotts in relation to nuclear issues and the impact they could have on the environment. It would extend to the protection of living things in other countries, such as South-East Asian rainforests. (Australia, Senate, Debates , (1996) Vol S180, p 5608-5609).

62 In the course of debate on the proposed amendment, a comment was made that some of the proposed provisions were "blunt instruments". Senator Campbell, representing the Government, responded that:
 this chamber should be informed that these so-called 'blunt instruments' are available only in respect to illegitimate, industrial action; that is action unrelated to workers' pay and conditions of employment and which wreaks damage on innocent third and fourth parties . (Australia, Senate, Debates , (1996) Vol S180, p 5607).

63 For reasons similar to those I have given in [53]-[54], these contributions to the debate in the Senate can be relied upon to confirm the use of the phrase "environmental protection" in s 45DD(3) in its ordinary meaning. Counsel for the applicants referred to statutory definitions of the word "environment" in other legislation, in an attempt to suggest that the phrase "environmental protection" should be construed to mean something less than it does in its ordinary meaning. He referred to s 4 of the Environment Protection Act 1970 (Vic) and to s 15 of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 (Cth). It is unnecessary to refer to those definitions in detail. Both demonstrate a legislative intention to make the provisions of their respective Acts applicable to a narrower concept of the environment than is involved in its ordinary meaning. The absence from the Trade Practices Act of a definition of "environmental protection" is both deliberate (as revealed by the statement of Senator Murray, to which I have referred in [60]) and significant in demonstrating an intention that the phrase should be used in its ordinary sense.</text>

<text>56 The view expressed by Hely J, that s 45DB(1) does not apply to acts anterior to the movement of goods from Australia to a place outside Australia, is consistent with dictionary definitions of the word "involving" and authorities dealing with the use of that word in other statutory contexts. The Macquarie Dictionary (revised edition) defines "involve" relevantly as follows: "to include as a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence; imply; entail" and "to include, contain or comprehend within itself or its scope." The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition) defines "involve" relevantly as: "to enfold, envelop, entangle, include"; "to include; to contain, imply"; and "to contain implicitly; to include as a necessary (and therefore unexpressed) feature, circumstance, antecedent condition, or consequence; to imply, entail." In Rimanic v Business Licensing Authority [2001] VSC 400 , Habersberger J had to consider whether a conviction for making a threat to kill was a conviction "of an offence involving violence", disqualifying a person from obtaining a licence as a motor car trader.

<tocase>Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 42 FLR 331</tocase>
<text>32 There is no reason to suppose that the word "purpose" in s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act was intended to have a meaning different from that in which it was used in the (previously enacted) s 45D(1). In Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348-349, Deane J said:
 The "purpose" referred to in s. 45D (1) is the operative subjective purpose of those engaging in the relevant conduct in concert... 
 
 It suffices, for present purposes, to say that, in my view, the question to be answered in determining whether conduct was engaged in for a "purpose" mentioned in s. 45D (1) of the Act is...to be answered not by reference to whether it was appreciated that the relevant conduct might have the specified effect but by reference to the real reason or reasons for, or the real purpose or purposes of, the conduct and to what was in truth the object in the minds of the relevant persons when they engaged in the conduct in concert.

33 This passage embodies the accepted meaning of the word "purpose" for s 45D(1) and, consequently, for s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act . It is therefore necessary to find the existence of a subjective purpose, on the part of each of the persons acting in concert, to prevent or substantially hinder a third person from engaging in the relevant trade or commerce. As to Mr Hahnheuser, it is relatively easy to ascertain a subjective purpose for his engagement in the conduct. What he said in his interviews makes it abundantly clear that he was trying to stop the sheep in the two feedlots from being loaded aboard the Al Shuwaikh for export to the Middle East.

34 It seems relatively clear from the terms of s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act , as Deane J in Tillmanns thought it seemed clear from the terms of s 45D(1) , that the subjective purpose concerned is required to have been held by each of the persons found to be acting in concert before the subsection can be applicable. Apart from the possibility that the name of the operator of the video camera in the motel bathroom or in the feedlot was either Diana Simpson or Mark Pearson, nothing is known about the identity, or even the number, of such person or persons. This makes the determination of a subjective purpose somewhat difficult without resorting to the proposition that, because the combined actions of the persons concerned had the effect of preventing or hindering the transporting to the Middle East as live animals of the particular consignment of sheep, this must have been their purpose. To adopt that reasoning is either to look for an objective purpose, or to do something indistinguishable from looking for an objective purpose.

35 There is a small amount of evidence about what others had in mind. Mr Hahnheuser was not the only one wearing the tee-shirt endorsed with the words "Ban Live Exports". One person held up signs, including one bearing these words, during some of the interviews given by Mr Hahnheuser. Mark Pearson appears to have lent his name to the Press Alert. On the basis of these facts, it is "reasonably open to find" that the representations made by Mr Hahnheuser in his media interviews were made by him in furtherance of a common purpose with the persons with whom he acted in concert. As a result, by s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), admissions in those representations are admissible in evidence as admissions of the other persons. In those interviews, Mr Hahnheuser expressed himself to be a spokesperson for others, as well as putting his own views. He made it clear that the adulteration of the sheep feed and the subsequent publicising of it were carried out with the purpose of preventing the export of the consignment of sheep. The evidence therefore supports a finding that Mr Hahnheuser's subjective purpose was also the subjective purpose of the other person or persons with whom Mr Hahnheuser acted in concert.

36 Assuming that at least one person other than Mr Hahnheuser, being a person with whom Mr Hahnheuser acted in concert, shared Mr Hahnheuser's purpose, the next question is as to the effect or likely effect of the conduct. The applicants' submissions pointed to the grounds expressed in the Secretary's direction of 19 November 2003. Certainly, the effect of the conduct concerned was that there was a delay of approximately two weeks in loading the bulk of the consignment of sheep on board the Al Shuwaikh , and 1,694 sheep, which had been kept in paddock X4 of the feedlot were not exported at all. This was the direct result of the Secretary's direction of 19 November 2003, and the variation to that direction on 4 December 2003. In turn, both of the Secretary's directions were brought about by the conduct complained of. In no sense could it be said that the Secretary's actions, first in preventing the grant of an export permit for the whole consignment of sheep, and then in excluding from the lifting of this ban what was thought to be 1,800 sheep, were intervening events in the chain of causation. That chain led directly from the conduct complained of to the delayed, and partially frustrated, export of the consignment of sheep.</text>

<text>65 Although Mr Hahnheuser has pleaded reliance on s 45DD(3) of the Trade Practices Act in his amended defence, there is a question whether he is entitled to rely on that provision when he has not participated in the trial of the proceeding. In other words, there is a question as to whether the onus of proof of the elements of s 45DD(3) falls on the person seeking to rely on it, or whether the party contending that a contravention of s 45DB(1) has occurred carries the onus of proving that the elements of s 45DD(3) did not exist. The resolution of this question must lie in ascertaining the intention of the legislature from the provisions of the legislation. Often, the fact that a provision is expressed as an exception to a general provision, whether or not it appears in the same section as the general provision, will be a significant indicator that the onus lies on the party seeking to take advantage of the exception. This is not a conclusive rule.
