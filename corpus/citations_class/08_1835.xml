<text>1 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, published as SZMFX v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1150. The judgment was given on 13 August 2008. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application by which the appellant sought to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), dated 28 March 2008 and handed down or sent on 17 April 2008. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.

2 The appellant is a citizen of Armenia. He arrived in Australia on 6 September 2006. On 24 August 2007, he applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a protection visa. On 5 November 2007, the Minister's delegate notified the appellant of the decision to refuse a protection visa.

3 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two instruments taken together, the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to any person who:
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country</text>
