<tocase>Bennett v United Kingdom (2001) 179 ALR 113</tocase>
<text>In Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1989) 23 FCR 282 a Full Court of this Court held at 303-4 that in order to determine whether a person was "eligible for surrender" the magistrate was required to determine, amongst other things, whether the offence was one which qualifies as an "extradition offence". In my opinion Zoeller, on this point, has been impliedly overruled by Kainhofer and for that reason I would not follow it. I am conscious that Katz J in Bennett v United Kingdom (2001) 179 ALR 113 at [6], which was decided after Kainhofer, followed Zoeller on this point. As his Honour observed, however, no argument was mounted that Kainhofer by implication overruled Zoeller in this respect and he did not consider the merits of such an argument.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2091.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant, pursuant to s 21 of the Act, seeks a review of the second respondent's determination of 20 August 2008. Section 21(2) of the Act confines the power of the review court to confirming or quashing the order of the magistrate; the matter cannot be remitted to the magistrate - Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1989) 90 ALR 555 at 563 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315 at 321. Where a review process undertaken by a court concerns, as is the case here, an issue arising under s 19(2) of the Act, that review is undertaken by way of a rehearing: Republic of South Africa v Dutton (1997) 77 FCR 128 at 136; 147 ALR 310 at 317. Section 21(6)(d) of the Act prescribes that the review court shall have regard only to the material before the magistrate: Zoeller at 582; Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs at 321; Snedden v Republic of Croatia [2009] FCA 30 at [18] .</text>

<tocase>Director of Public Prosecutions v Kainhofer (1995) 185 CLR 528</tocase>
<text>In Director of Public Prosecutions v Kainhofer (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 537, consideration was given to the jurisdiction of a magistrate exercising functions under s 19 of the Act. In the joint judgment of Brennan CJ and Dawson and McHugh JJ (with whom Toohey J agreed), it was held that the conditions of jurisdiction prescribed by s 19(1) must be satisfied and then consideration must be given to the compliance of the supporting documents with the requirements of s 19(2)(a) and (b). Then the character of the conduct of the person constituting the offence or equivalent conduct must be ascertained under sub-s (2)(c) and finally the magistrate must decide whether the person has shown any substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence under sub-s (2)(d) at p 537.

However, their Honours concluded at p 538 that the power of a s 19 magistrate did not extend to the reviewing of the satisfaction of the original magistrate or of the opinion of the Attorney-General as to whether the person is an extraditable person. Significantly their Honours said at p 539: 
 The authority of a magistrate to conduct proceedings under s 19 depends on the matters specified in sub-s (1) including the making of an order of remand under s 15 and the giving of a s 16 notice. Lacking any power to review those decisions, a s 19 magistrate must proceed on the footing that the order and the notice, if not invalid ex facie, were validly made. Treating the order of remand and the giving of the notice as valid, the s 19 magistrate must proceed on the footing that the person whose surrender is sought is an extraditable person and that the case falls within either par (a)(i) or par (a)(ii) of s 6. It would be a curious interpretation of s 19 to attribute to a s 19 magistrate the power to find that the person is not an extraditable person when the s 19 magistrate's authority depends on the contrary hypothesis. In the administrative sequence, that issue is committed only to the consideration of the magistrate under s 12(1) and the Attorney-General under s 16. 

 
 The function of the s 19 magistrate under sub-s (2)(a) of s 19 is concerned solely with the correspondence between the "supporting documents in relation to the offence" produced to the magistrate and the description of "supporting documents" in sub-s (3). The "offence" referred to in sub-s (2)(a) is the offence referred to in sub-s (1), namely, "the extradition offence or extradition offences for which surrender of the person is sought by the extradition country". Given that the person is an extraditable person, "the offence" in s 19(2)(a) must be taken to be either an offence "that the person is accused of having committed" or an offence of which the "person has been convicted". (Emphasis added)

In this case no question arises as to whether the magistrate was in error in being satisfied as to any of the matters set out under s 19(1) or (2) of the Act. The issue is whether Article 2 para 5 of the Treaty operates upon s 19(1) so as to require the magistrate to consider whether, as a matter of law, the offence, namely the alleged war crime, was an extradition offence within the meaning of the Act. In my opinion the reasoning in Kainhofer is apt to the present case. The opinion of Attorney-General, necessarily formed under s 16(2)(a)(i) of the Act and prior to giving the Notice under s 16(1), that the applicant is an "extraditable person" is not reviewable under s 19 by the magistrate. Neither, in my view, is the related opinion of the Attorney-General reviewable that the offence articulated in the extradition request is an "extradition offence" for the purposes of the Act. Before forming the opinion that a person is an "extraditable person" the Attorney-General, by reason of s 6(b) of the Act must be satisfied that the offence is an "extradition offence".

Furthermore and for the particular purposes of s 19 of the Act "extradition offence" referred to there is, by virtue of s 10(4) of the Act, the extradition offence to which the notice relates. Section 10(4) provides: 
 A reference in this Act to an extradition offence for which surrender of a person is sought by an extradition country is, in relation to a time after the Attorney-General has given a notice under subsection 16(1) in relation to the person, a reference to any extradition offence to which the notice (including the notice as amended) relates. 

 
The Notice in this case expresses the extradition offence to be the alleged war crime.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (1994) 52 FCR 386</tocase>
<text>The different stages of the extradition process within the framework of the Act were summarised by the Full Federal Court in Harris v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389. The Full Court observed: 
 The Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows: (1) Commencement; (2) Remand; (3) Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender; (4) Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered. In summary form, the scheme is as follows: The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional arrest warrant under s 12(1) or by the giving of a notice under s 16(1). Once arrested, the person is required by s 15 to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s 19. Where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney-General has given notice under s 16(1), provision is made under s 19 for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender. If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate, a provision is made by s 22 for the Attorney-General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered.

By virtue of s 11(1)(a) of the Act, regulations may state that the Act applies in relation to a specified extradition country subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to give effect to a bilateral extradition treaty in relation to the country, being a treaty a copy of which is set out in the regulations. Relevantly, Hungary is declared to be an extradition country pursuant to regulation 3 of the Regulations. By virtue of s 5 of the Act any country "that is declared by the regulations to be an extradition country" is an "extradition country" for the purposes of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Oates v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (2002) 118 FCR 544</tocase>
<text>Nonetheless, there is some support to be found for the applicant's earlier written submission in the observations of O'Loughlin and Whitlam JJ in Oates v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (2002) 118 FCR 544 at [25].

However, even if this submission were made good it could not, in my opinion, affect the result in this case. I have already noted the binding effect of the opinion of the Attorney-General expressed in the Notice, that the applicant is an extraditable person. It was open to the applicant to have sought review under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) of the Attorney-General's decision to issue the Notice under s 16(1) of the Act: Kainhofer at pp 538-539. He did not do so.</text>

<tocase>Papzoglou v Republic of the Philippines (1997) 74 FCR 108</tocase>
<text>As a Full Court of this Court held in Papzoglou v Republic of the Philippines (1997) 74 FCR 108 at 140, s 11(6) of the Act makes clear that whatever the proper construction of s 19(2) of the Act, the matters that a magistrate has to consider in proceedings to determine eligibility for surrender under s 19(2) do not include restrictions or limitations arising under a treaty. In my opinion, the same necessarily applies to the application of s 19(1) of the Act.

The applicant sought to distinguish the terms of the treaty relied upon in Papzoglou from Article 2 para 5 which is relied upon in this case. He submits that the treaty provision that was sought there to be incorporated in the s 19 process was a treaty provision that required the requested state to take into account the question of whether the extradition of the person would be unjust, oppressive, incompatible with humanitarian considerations, or too severe a punishment.

I do not accept this submission, to the effect that s 11(6) is directed only to the operation of s 19(2)(a)-(d). In terms it governs the whole of s 19 and, in particular, is directed to the determination under s 19(1) by the magistrate as to eligibility for surrender of the person in relation to the extradition offence.

I observed earlier, at [31]-[32] above, that the written submission of the applicant, concerning the effect of Art 2 para 5 of the Treaty upon the Act, was that it altered the definition of "extradition offence" in s 5 to exclude, in this case, an offence which was not an offence at the time the acts or omissions constituting the offence took place. In oral argument the applicant appeared to focus his submission rather on the effect Art 2 para 5 was said to have upon the matters to be considered by the magistrate under s 19(1) of the Act.

Article 2 para 5 of the Treaty may operate in respect to s 16 and may also operate upon the exercise of the discretion of the Attorney-General under s 22(3)(e) of the Act. This is at the fourth phase of the extradition proceedings which are yet to occur: Todhunter v United States of America at p 75; Papzoglou at p 130.</text>

<tocase>Todhunter v United States of America (1995) 57 FCR 70</tocase>
<text>Section 11(1C) of the Act provides that for the purposes of sub-s (1) and (1A), the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that are necessary to give effect to a treaty may be expressed in the form that "this Act applies to the country concerned subject to that treaty." By virtue of regulation 4 of the ons, the Act applies in relation to the Republic of Hungary "subject to the Treaty." Regulation 4 provides: "The [Act] applies in relation to the Republic of Hungary subject to the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Republic of Hungary (a copy of which is set out in the Schedule)." The effect of the regulations is to import the terms of the Treaty into the municipal law: Todhunter v United States of America (1995) 57 FCR 70 at 76. This is subject to the provisions of s 11(6) of the Act.

Section 11(6) of the Act provides that for the purpose of determining whether a person is eligible for surrender under s 19(1) "no limitation, condition, qualification or exception otherwise applicable under this section ... has the effect of requiring or permitting a magistrate to be satisfied of any matter other than a matter set out in paragraph 19(2)(a), (b), (c) or (d)."

The hearing before the second respondent was the third stage in these extradition proceedings; that is, a determination under s 19 of the Act as to whether the applicant was eligible for surrender.

Article 2 para 5 of the Treaty may operate in respect to s 16 and may also operate upon the exercise of the discretion of the Attorney-General under s 22(3)(e) of the Act. This is at the fourth phase of the extradition proceedings which are yet to occur: Todhunter v United States of America at p 75; Papzoglou at p 130.</text>

Section 21(2) of the Act confines the power of the review court to confirming or quashing the order of the magistrate; the matter cannot be remitted to the magistrate - Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1989) 90 ALR 555 at 563 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315 at 321.

In my opinion Zoeller, on this point, has been impliedly overruled by Kainhofer and for that reason I would not follow it. I am conscious that Katz J in Bennett v United Kingdom (2001) 179 ALR 113 at [6], which was decided after Kainhofer, followed Zoeller on this point. As his Honour observed, however, no argument was mounted that Kainhofer by implication overruled Zoeller in this respect and he did not consider the merits of such an argument.</text>
