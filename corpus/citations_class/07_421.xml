<text>11 To the extent that it is relevant, I am satisfied that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person by the making of the orders that I propose. I have been referred to the decision of Lindgren J in Re Insurance Australia Group Limited [2003] FCA 581 , concerning ss 723(3) and 724 (1) of the Corporations Act and the possible application of s 1322(4)(d) to failure to comply with those provisions. I have no reservations at all concerning the correctness of his Honour's decision. However, there is a difference between s 625 on the one hand, and s 723 on the other.

12 Section 723 provides that, where there is failure to apply for admission of securities pursuant to a public offering, the issue or transferring of securities in response to an application made under a relevant disclosure document is void, and the person offering the securities must return the money. That is to say, the Act itself operates in the event of failure to make the relevant application to strike down and invalidate a transfer. In the present circumstances, there is a term of a contractual arrangement between private parties that is the source of difficulty. I am satisfied, however, that s 1325A confers an appropriate power on the Court, whether or not ss 1322 or 1325D does so.

13 In the circumstances I propose to make an order that the Statutory Offer Condition be varied by substituting the words " no later than 19 February 2007 " for the words " within a period of seven days after the start of the offer period " and to order that the Statutory Offer Condition of each contract made by acceptance of the offers be deemed to have been satisfied on 19 February 2007. 


 I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.
