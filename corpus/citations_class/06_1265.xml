<text>I also make mention that whilst there may be a reluctance on the part of courts to make interlocutory mandatory orders, including orders involving employees to return to work, such a reluctance may not apply to conduct which is prima facie in breach of the Act: Amcor Packaging (Australia) Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2002] FCA 127.

The question then arises as to what relief to provide in the circumstances. The position arising in this proceeding is different from the position which confronted Merkel J in the Amcor Packaging (Australia) Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2002] FCA 127. In this proceeding there is an application made to enforce the Order of Commissioner Eames, more particularly the order in par 4.3 set out above. I do not repeat the observations of Merkel J in relation to the situation where only the union is a party and the relevant employees are not joined in the proceeding. As he indicated, sometimes the appropriate course is to seek enforcement orders against the employees and not make orders against a union that it require, order or direct the employees to return to work. However, in this proceeding application is made to actually enforce the order of Commissioner Eames, in particular the order that the AMWU must take all reasonable steps available under its Rules to ensure the relevant members comply with the Order and not engage in industrial action. This part of the Order is one the respondent itself must comply with under s 496(10) and can be enforced under s 496(12).

I do not consider that all reasonable steps have been taken by the respondent to comply with the Order. I am mindful that the respondent has urged and encouraged certain action on behalf of its members. However, it is apparent that the delegates have not adhered to that urging or encouragement and, in fact, there has been a period of industrial action extending now more than a short period of time and over a larger area than just the Preston Site. It is my view that further action under the Rules of the respondent could be reasonably availed of by the respondent. In these instances I would direct the respondent to take all reasonable steps that are available under its Rules to ensure the relevant members comply with the Order of Mr Eames.

In light of these conclusions I propose to order, subject to hearing counsel as to any matters that may arise out of the proposed orders and their operation, the following: 
 
 1. Until trial or further order, the respondent (whether by any of its officers, delegates, employees, agents or howsoever otherwise): 
 
 
 1.1 be restrained from directing, organising, inducing, encouraging, procuring or authorising any or all of the employees of the applicant who work at its site at 29 Bell Street, Preston, in the State of Victoria ('the Employees') to stop work or fail to work other than in accordance with Amcor Flexibles Australasia (Preston) Enterprise Agreement 2005 ('the Preston Agreement');
 1.2 be required to take any and all steps reasonably available to it under its rules to ensure that the Employees: 
 
 
 
 
 1.2.1 cease and desist from engaging in industrial action or failing to work otherwise than in accordance with the Preston Agreement; and
 1.2.2 make themselves available for work and perform work as the applicant may reasonably require; and 
 
 
 
 
 1.3 without in any way limiting subparagraph 1.2 above, be required to take all reasonable steps available to it to direct its delegates and members employed at the Preston Site, both orally, by holding meetings, and in writing, to list any and all bans, limitations or restrictions on the performance of work at the Preston Site, including ceasing any and all strike action. 
 
 
 2. The proceeding be listed for directions on a date to be fixed.
 3. Costs be reserved.

<text>Further, an issue which arises in the context of interim relief in industrial law matters is that the interim relief could be in effect the grant of final relief. On the other hand, it is also common for the refusal to grant interim relief to be a refusal to grant final relief in actual fact. In Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (unreported, Madgwick J, 17 November 1998) the AIRC had made an order under s 127(1) of the Act that a proposed national stoppage not occur. In that case the refusal to grant interim relief to enforce the order effectively meant the refusal for final relief to enforce the order as the national stoppage was to take place before the final hearing; See too Transfield Construction Pty Ltd v Automotive Food, Metal, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2002] FCA 1413.</text>

<text>Before any interlocutory injunction is granted, the Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction: see, e.g. Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 621; Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55.</text>

<text>These two matters are not to be considered in isolation from each other and the strengths or weaknesses of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by the balance of convenience: see, e.g. Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472 ('Bullock') .

A particular issue arises in this case where there is a doubtful claim, which, nevertheless, raises a serious question to be tried. Here the claim may, nevertheless, still attract interlocutory relief if there is a marked balance of convenience in favour of that claim: see Mobileworld Operating Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2005] FCA 1365 at [20] per Weinberg J ('Mobileworld') citing Bullock at 472. Further, it is to be remembered that the threshold for a serious question to be tried is not particularly onerous. As Weinberg J said in Mobileworld at [23]: 
 
 Sometimes, on an application for interlocutory relief, a court is sufficiently able, on the evidence before it, to reach a conclusion as to particular facts or matters in dispute. However, it must be remembered that any such conclusion will be provisional, and by no means necessarily the same as that which is subsequently reached at the final hearing. The degree to which a court is prepared to investigate disputes of fact depends on their difficulty and on the other circumstances in question, and particularly on the extent of urgency or prospective hardship involved: ICF Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , (6th ed, 2001) at 466.'</text>
