<tocase>Re AFG Insurances Ltd [2002] NSWCA 803</tocase>
<text>In Re AFG Insurances Ltd [2002] NSWCA 803 at [5] and [9]-[11], Barrett J considered a number of authorities which have dealt with the question of the time to be extended for convening the meeting, particularly bearing in mind administrations of some complexity. The authorities to which his Honour referred indicate that in certain cases, an extension of up to five months has been granted.

I am mindful of what Barrett J said in AFG Insurances at [11]. His Honour emphasised that that was a special case with complications and difficulties which one would not expect to be encountered in the normal course and that every case must be approached on its merits without any particular reliance on what has happened in other cases. Nevertheless, this case does have some similarities to the considerations which arose in AFG Insurances . In particular, as I said earlier, BBL has no employees, no leases and no secured creditors. In substance the only substantial creditor of BBL is the 8000 noteholders for whom the trustee has been appointed. Accordingly, the question which often arises in these applications is not present here. That is to say, there appear to be no persons affected by the statutory moratorium who might wish to complain about the extension of time which is sought.

I also, of course, take into account the fact that no objection was voiced at the first meeting of creditors, albeit that only approximately 100 noteholders were present and that not all of the 8000 noteholders attended that meeting. I also take into account that the trustee has not objected.

There are, it appears, some other very minor creditors of BBL, but on the evidence before me these creditors appear to amount in value to approximately $200,000.</text>

<text>There are a substantial number of authorities dealing with the principles to be applied, many of which are referred to in the written submissions of the administrators. They include the decision of Lindgren J in Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77 at [41] and [42], and the decision of Hayne J in Re Brash Holdings Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 793 at 794.</text>

<tocase>Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 575 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 446</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/575.html</AustLII>
<text>The orders which are proposed take into account the form of the order made by Lindgren J in Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 575 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 446. His Honour there observed that it is desirable that there be an order permitting the meeting to be held before the end of the extended convening period, so that in this case, the administrators will have the ability to convene the meeting earlier than 17 August 2009 if they see the need to do so. Moreover, liberty to apply is granted to any person who can demonstrate sufficient interest to modify or discharge the orders that I will make today, upon appropriate notice being given to the administrators.

For those reasons I propose to grant the extension which is sought. However, I would add this. Bearing in mind the careful consideration which has been given to the period of the extension, without of course wishing to fetter the discretion of a judge who may be called upon to do so, I would have some doubts as to whether it may be appropriate for any further extension to be granted. It seems to me that careful consideration has thus far been given to the required period of the extension, but there is always the need to balance the considerations which have been referred to in the authorities of the need to strike the appropriate balance between the speed of the administration and the ability of creditors and shareholders to maximise their return.
 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2001/313.html</AustLII>
<text>The principles applicable to the extension of the convening period prescribed by section 439A of the Act have been considered in a number of authorities. The authorities commence with a decision of Young J in Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 611 at 612. The principle referred to by Young J was also stated in Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Limited [2001] NSWSC 313 by Barrett J at [10]. His Honour observed that: 
 The function of the Court on an application such as this is, as I see it, to strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the expectation that the administration will be a relatively speedy and summary matter and, on the other, the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed toward maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders.</text>

<tocase>Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Small Goods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1933.html</AustLII>
<text>I also referred to the difficulties which arise in determining the period to permit the appropriate period for an extension in Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Small Goods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 at [23] - [25] .

It seems to me that I ought to take into account the careful consideration which has been given to this question by both of the administrators. It is plain that the administration is a complex one, bearing in mind in particular the size of the BBL Group and the substantial inquiries which the administrators need to pursue, including the need for legal advice.</text>
