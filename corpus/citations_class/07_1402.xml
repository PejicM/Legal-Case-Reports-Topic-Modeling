<tocase>Puzey v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1615 ; (2002) 51 ATR 616</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1615.html</AustLII>
<text>57 Mr Underwood gave opinion evidence relating to the level of fees charged to the investors. In 2001 the Commissioner had asked him to inspect the plantation the subject of the Kununurra tropical forestry project also known as the AllRange Project and to provide a report on its progress. That project, which had been earlier considered and rejected by Mr Lenzo, also involved the growing of sandalwood in the Ord. Mr Underwood had formed the opinion that the fees charged to the investors in that project for the purchase of sandalwood seedlings and host seedlings were excessive and gave evidence to that effect in Federal Court proceedings, Puzey v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1615 ; (2002) 51 ATR 616. In relation to the EKS project however, he was not of the same opinion. He said that investors in that project were charged fees totalling $60,000 per hectare for services performed by EKS as manager of the project as outlined in the lease and management agreements. The services involved: 
1. Planting and raising Santalum Album seedlings or trees.
 
 2. Planting on the invested areas as soon as practicable after execution of the relevant lease and management agreement sufficient Santalum Album seedlings or trees.
 3. Planting on the investors' areas such other trees as might reasonably be necessary or required to enable or encourage growth of, or protect, the Santalum Album seedlings.
 4. Cultivating, tending, culling, pruning, fertilising, spraying, irrigating and otherwise caring for the trees as and when required. 
 5. Collecting seeds and propagation material from the investors' areas.
 6. Keeping in good repair access roads to the investors' areas. 
 7. Using all reasonable measures by fumigating and poisoning for extermination and keeping the investors' areas free from vermin. 
 8. At all times maintaining in good repair and condition fire breaks and irrigation channels in and about the investors' areas. 
 9. Maintaining the investors' areas according to good forestry practices; and 
 10. Paying all costs and expenses of establishing and maintaining the plantation. 


Based on his experience and knowledge of other similar Indian sandalwood projects issued by EKS and an organisation he referred to as ITC, Mr Underwood considered that the fees charged to investors were similar across all projects. The project managers of the 2006 ITC sandalwood project charged investors a fee of $3,520 per 0.04 ha for establishment. This equated to $88,000 per hectare. On that comparison, he regarded the fees charged to investors in the project currently under consideration as not excessive.

58 Mr Underwood was cross-examined in relation to his report in the prospectus. He agreed that as of March 1998 there had not been any international sales of Indian sandalwood grown in Australia of which he knew. He was also cross-examined about the adequacy of the provision for replanting and infilling where planted trees had died. He said in his experience most forestry projects nearly always involved an expectation that there would be some need for replanting in the second year. He did not himself inquire as to whether there was such a provision in relation to the EKS project. He just naturally assumed that it would happen. He agreed that the EKS project had suffered early mortality among seedlings in the first wet season immediately after planting. As to the risks which he perceived associated with sandalwood plantations he said: 
 
 The tricky aspect with growing Indian sandalwood is that it requires hosts that cut in at different times of the rotation and until you've grown a plantation through to maturity and done everything, you're still basing your experience on the research plots rather than on actual plantations and I've made that clear in every report I've written, that this is a risk that investors need to know about. 
 

He explained the concept of the host in the course of cross-examination. The sandalwood is a parasitic or semi-parasitic tree which attaches its roots to the roots of other trees. When a sandalwood plantation is grown from seedlings through to maturity it is necessary to establish a range of different host species during the 15 year period of the growth. The host trees are planted in amongst the sandalwood, adjacent to the sandalwood trees. Progressively the sandalwood kills the trees of the host species and sucks them dry so that other host species trees are needed to replace them.

59 I accept Mr Underwood's evidence that the set up and management of the EKS plantation project indicated that it was properly conceived and generally properly managed. The question whether fees charged to investors were "excessive" involves normative judgments the basis of which needs to be made clear in order to establish their relevance. In a case such as the present, if the level of entry fees paid is able to be characterised, on objective criteria, as inflated beyond what is relevant to the interests and services being acquired, and the costs, direct and indirect, of providing them, then that fact, in combination with others, may support the conclusion that a dominant purpose for entering the scheme was to acquire a tax benefit. In this case Mr Underwood's opinion about the fees was based upon the range of services provided and in that sense was properly based. Using a criterion of somewhat lesser reliability it invoked comparisons with other Indian sandalwood projects. I accept overall that Mr Underwood did have a proper basis for his opinion that the fees charged were reasonable. Such opinions however are necessarily more qualitative than quantitative in character.

60 Evidence was also called from Mr Anantha Padmanabha who, along with Mr Underwood, had prepared a report which was included in the prospectus. He has over 43 years experience in forestry in India predominantly dealing with sandalwood. There was no challenge to his qualifications or expertise.

61 Mr Padmanabha said the sale price of sandalwood in India over the period from 1990 to 2006 has increased from US$4,000 per ton to US$77,000 per ton. That represented an average increase of 23% per annum. In his opinion the increasing price trend will continue due to the rapid reduction in the supply of Indian sandalwood caused by dwindling production. Demand for the wood is increasing in the domestic market of India and in international markets. The gap between supply and demand is also dramatically increasing.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/94.html</AustLII>
<text>81 Counsel for Mr Lenzo made written closing submissions about the admissibility of the evidence of Messrs Sammon, Begley and Padmanabha. He relied upon the decision of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211. The Court there upheld the Commissioner's application of Pt IVA. Both Hill and Carr JJ referred to the significance of poor projected financial returns from the particular scheme.

82 The case concerned an investment in a tea tree oil farming project. The Court held, having regard to the eight matters listed in s 177D(b) of the ITAA 1936, that the taxpayers had entered into and carried out the investment scheme for the purposes of obtaining a tax benefit. The Court had regard to the commercial uncertainty of the scheme in concluding that its tax purposes predominated over its commercial purposes.

83 In considering the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out for the purposes of s 177D(b)(i), Hill J observed that the commercial investment in tea trees was attendant with risk. Without the tax benefits which the prospectus predicted "the commercial returns were far from encouraging" (at [75]). Carr J, in considering the "form and substance of the scheme" for the purpose of s 177D(b)(ii) referred to "what can only be described as miniscule projected returns over a long period of time from a venture which on all the evidence involved significant risk so described in the Prospectus" (at [216]).</text>

<tocase>Calder v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 59 ATR 655</tocase>
<text>84 At first instance in Calder v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 59 ATR 655, Nicholson J relied upon expert evidence of the poor projected returns (when properly calculated before tax and before finance) as a significant factor attracting the application of Pt IVA: 
 
 However as to factor (2) Mr Langridge's evidence was that the Project relied upon the tax deductibility and effect of the initial payments and the gearing up provided by the loan to show any rate of return. In those circumstances it cannot be objectively found that the dominant purpose of the applicant's entry into the scheme was to enable the applicant to make a commercial investment: the tax benefit was the key to the commerciality of the scheme.

85 Counsel for Mr Lenzo submitted that the evidence of Messrs Sammon and Begley confirmed that the internal rate of return forecast was 13.82% per annum before tax and before finance where the applicant pre-pays the maintenance and rent fees. Their unchallenged evidence was that the projected returns from the project were commensurate with the risks. Mr Sammon's unchallenged evidence was that the project was an "Investment Grade" investment without any reliance being placed on tax benefits and that the project showed strong financial returns on a before tax and before finance basis.

86 Counsel also pointed to Mr Padmanabha's evidence of an increase in demand for Indian sandalwood and the increase in average price. He also submitted evidence that the EKS project was suitable to Mr Lenzo's particular financial circumstances and that it did not rely on tax benefits and financing to show an acceptable return was relevant to whether Mr Lenzo could be regarded as having had a dominant tax purpose. Such evidence, it was submitted, was an objective fact to which regard must be had in considering whether Mr Lenzo had a dominant tax purpose and, in particular, in considering the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out, the form and substance of the scheme and the change in the financial position of Mr Lenzo that had resulted, would result, or might reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/26.html</AustLII>
<text>120 Assuming there was a tax benefit, s 177D requires attention to the question whether, having regard to the eight factors listed in para (b) "it would be concluded that" Mr Lenzo or any other person who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of it "did so for the purpose of enabling [Mr Lenzo] to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme". The purposes to be considered are those attributable to "relevant persons who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme". Section 177D(b) is not concerned with attributing a purpose to "the scheme": Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at [63] . The test of purpose is objective and not to be answered in whole or in part by reference to actual subjective purposes. If there is more than one purpose to be imputed, the question is whether the taxation benefit purpose was the dominant purpose. By that is meant the "ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose": Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 416. The importance of setting aside subjective purposes whether they favour the taxpayer or the Commissioner's position was emphasised in the joint judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Hart 217 CLR at [65] where, speaking of the structuring of the loan in issue in that case they said: 
 
 Of course the loan was structured in the say it was in order to achieve the most desirable taxation result. But those are statements about why the respondents acted as they did or about why the lender (or its agent) structured the loan in the way it was. They are not statements which provide an answer to the question posed by s 177D(b). That provision requires the drawing of a conclusion about purpose from the eight identified objective matters; it does not require, or event permit, any inquiry into the subjective motives of the relevant taxpayers or others who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of it.

121 The question posed by s 177D(b) is holistic. Each of the eight specified factors must be taken into account. But the decisionmaker, being the Commissioner, or a judge on appeal from the Commissioner, is not required to award points for each factor like a judging panel in an ice skating competition. The enumerated factors identify essential elements associated with entry into and implementation of the scheme in question and are to be considered together. Having regard to the submissions of both parties, I make the following observations in respect of each of the eight factors listed in s 177D(b): 
 (i) As to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out.

122 The marketing of the scheme as set out in the prospectus supports the proposition that it was to be entered into as a serious commercial project. On Mr Sammon's evidence it did not need to rely upon tax benefits in order to provide a sufficient financial return to qualify as an investment grade product. I do not consider that the evidence indicates any over-emphasis on tax benefits to be derived from the scheme. The marketing of any commercial investment product can draw attention to its tax benefits by rendering the gaining of those benefits the dominant purpose of the product. In this case, in my opinion, the tax benefits as marketed were subordinate to the reasonably based commercial returns albeit those returns, being high, carried a corresponding level of risk.

123 A second relevant aspect of the manner in which the scheme was entered into was said by the Commissioner to be related to the timing of Mr Lenzo's execution of the documents. This falls for consideration under the factor identified in s 177D(b)(iii). I consider that the fact that the scheme was entered into on 30 June 1998 and the execution of prepared proforma documents occurred on that date can be taken as indicative of a desire to obtain a tax benefit for the 1998 year of income. But while it goes into the balance in support of the Commissioner's contentions as to dominant purpose, it is not a factor to which, in this case, I attribute great weight. If there is a significant commercial benefit to be derived from an investment and an associated tax benefit, entry into the investment scheme on 30 June 1998 with a view to obtaining the tax benefit in that year is entirely consistent with a predominantly commercial purpose.

124 The round-robin upon which much emphasis was placed by the Commissioner carries with it the negative connotations traditionally associated with such apparently artificial transactions. I accept that Mr Lenzo's lack of awareness of that transaction is immaterial. However the significance of it for the assessment of a dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit for Mr Lenzo is not apparent. In a sense it overlaps with the question whether a tax benefit was obtained given the alternative of external financing to individual growers. It was not as though they were being offered non-recourse loans by Arwon. While the round-robin is a factor which in combination with other matters might support an inference of a dominant tax purpose, it is not determinative of the existence of such a purpose. Moreover it may be seen as an incident of the much more significant commercial purposes achievable with or without a tax benefit.

125 The Commissioner also pointed to the small initial outlay of $535 in the 1998 year of income and the obligation to make a payment of only $7,506 on 30 September 1998. He contended that the savings of $10,112.25 from the total tax deductions claimed of $20,850 exceeded the amount of the payment required on 30 September 1998. He went on to refer, under this heading, to the effect of the various agreements on Mr Lenzo's ability to claim tax deductions in 1999 and 2000. He also argued that only the amount of $7,506 actually paid out of the $20,315 nominally contributed by Mr Lenzo in terms of his liabilities was ever available to the manager for the pursuit of the commercial objectives of growing, harvesting and selling the Indian sandalwood. He contended that the amount of the initial maintenance fees and rent payable by Mr Lenzo was not related to the pursuit of those commercial objectives but reflected a desire to enable him to achieve tax savings in excess of the amount of his initial cash outlay in relation to the project. At one point in the submissions the Commissioner seemed to be slipping into a subjective test of purpose.

126 It was pointed out by counsel for Mr Lenzo that the $7,506 was paid from his own cash funds. His 1998 assessment issued in mid-November did not result in a tax benefit to him. Counsel submitted that there was no evidence that the borrowed funds in 1998 were not "available" for the management of the wood lots. Counsel pointed to financial statements of the EKS project manager which showed substantial funds available in the 1998 year. In 1998 and 1999 the EKS project manager had sufficient funds available for the management of the allotments.

131 It is true that but for the application of Pt IVA Mr Lenzo's deductions would be allowable under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act as business expenditures. It is plain however that a mere fact that a taxpayer claims a tax benefit does not mean that Pt IVA applies. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; 217 CLR 216 at [53] :
 
 The bare fact that a taxpayer pays less tax, if one form of transaction rather than another is made, does not demonstrate that Pt IVA applies. Simply to show that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit does not show that Pt IVA applies. 
 

 (v) Any change in the financial position of the relevant taxpayer that resulted, will result, or may reasonably be expected to result from the scheme

132 The Commissioner simply submitted under this heading that the financial position of Mr Lenzo was improved by the tax savings which the scheme generated. He received immediate tax savings which exceeded his cash outlays in respect of the scheme in the 1998 and 1999 years of income. In the following years of income he would receive the benefit of deductions for interest accrued but unpaid and indemnity fees which would all but offset the actual cash outlays in respect of the indemnity fees. His exposure to further cash outlays would turn upon the success or otherwise of the plantation and the operation of the indemnity agreement at the completion of the scheme. Counsel for Mr Lenzo submitted that this factor is to assessed at the time that the relevant transactions were entered into.

133 The change in the financial position of Mr Lenzo that must be considered under (iv) is not limited to tax benefits but also the prospect of a commercial return which he has acquired by the investment. The evidence was clear that this was a real prospect although attended by the usual risks of any agricultural cultivation scheme. The forecast financial returns for this project were described as "attractive on a pre-tax basis". The forecast returns cannot, in my opinion, be dismissed as merely speculative. There was, on the evidence, a reasonable prospect of a return. 
 
 

 (iv) Any change in the financial position of any person who has or has had, any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) with the relevant taxpayer, being a change that has resulted, will result or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme.</text>
