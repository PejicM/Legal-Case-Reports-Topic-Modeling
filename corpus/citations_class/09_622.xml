<tocase>SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 152</tocase>
<text>In SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 152, Lander J (with whom Moore and Marshall JJ agreed) stated in relation to Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 and SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 the following (at [97]): 
 It should be only in exceptional circumstances that a Court should refuse to issue the constitutional writs once the Court has determined that the Tribunal had failed to comply with its imperative statutory obligations to an applicant seeking the review of a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant a protection visa. If it were otherwise, and the Court were required to inquire into the extent to which the failure by the Tribunal to comply with its statutory obligations to accord an applicant a fair hearing prejudiced the applicant, the imperative obligation imposed on the Tribunal might well be blunted. 
 
 
The appellant contended that on this approach relief would not be refused in the present case on the basis of inutility. Although the issue does not need to be determined I accept the first respondent's submission that the present case does not involve imperative statutory obligations within the meaning of that judgment.

Further, I agree with the Federal Magistrate that there is a strong discretionary reason in favour of refusing relief. The inquiry which the appellant contended that the Tribunal should have conducted had to be undertaken by the Federal Magistrate in the context of the challenge to the Tribunal's decision. It would be odd, to say the least, if the Federal Magistrate had concluded that the appellant had not instructed the agent to include the political claim and yet remitted the matter to the Tribunal to determine that very same question. This is the more so when it is appreciated that both parties subpoenaed the agent to give evidence before the Federal Magistrate but neither side called on the subpoena. The agent answered the subpoena by filing an affidavit in which he set out his version of events. The appellant sought to tender the affidavit without calling the agent and intended to invite the Federal Magistrate to find that the contents of the affidavit were false. The Federal Magistrate upheld the first respondent's objection to such a course.

Following discussion with the Court the appellant's counsel applied to amend the second ground of appeal. The application was refused as the proposed ground had no hope of success. It asserted that the Tribunal had failed to consider the appellant's risk of future persecution in Bangladesh when the reasons of the Tribunal on their face clearly showed that the Tribunal had given consideration to the very issue. Further reasons for dismissing the ground were given orally by the Court during the hearing. The original form of the ground alleged errors which on their face did not amount to jurisdictional errors. The written submissions similarly failed to identify any arguable jurisdictional errors. It is desirable that the first respondent move the Court prior to the hearing in such circumstances to have such groundless allegations rejected before written submissions are required.</text>

<tocase>SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 ; (2008) 247 ALR 451</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/105.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant argued that the reference to "evidence as whole" included a reference to the evidence about the appellant's activities in Australia. If that were so the inclusion of consideration of evidence about the appellant's activities in Australia would be contrary to s 91R(3) which required such evidence to be disregarded where, as here, the Court has found that those activities were undertaken to strengthen the appellant's claim: see SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 ; (2008) 247 ALR 451.

This argument should not be accepted. The reference to evidence as a whole read in context excludes the evidence of the appellant's Australian conduct. It is unreal to suggest that the Tribunal having just said that it disregards the appellant's conduct in Australia, in the next sentence contradicts itself. That this is not the case is confirmed by the reference in the concluding summary four paragraphs later where the Tribunal repeats: 
 [I]t has disregarded his politically related conduct in Australia since July 2007 as it is not satisfied that he engaged in that conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee.

It follows from these reasons that the appeal will be dismissed. 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice North.
