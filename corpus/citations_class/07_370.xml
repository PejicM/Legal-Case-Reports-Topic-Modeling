<tocase>Applicant S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 295</tocase>

<text>47 The applicant in S1083 of 2003 sought an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, against Moore J's decision. That application was dismissed by Allsop J ( Applicant S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 295). His Honour adopted the reasons that he gave for dismissing a similar application brought by another person who had been an applicant before Moore J in S1083 of 2003 ( Applicant S1510 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 294). Allsop J said that Moore J's view that Ozmanian FCA and Ozmanian FCAFC conclusively determined that the Court had no jurisdiction to review the refusal of the Minister and of the Department to consider the application under s 417 was correct, and that his Honour had correctly dismissed the application as incompetent.

48 Applicant S1083 of 2003 applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for special leave to appeal ( Applicant S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA Trans 015). The Court expressed itself as not being convinced that there was any error in the ultimate disposition of the matter in the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>64 Ms Connolly's decision is not something provided for by the Act, and does not itself affect legal rights; cf Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 335 338. The decision of Ms Connolly is not susceptible to judicial review. The only decision that might conceivably be susceptible to judicial review is that of the Minister. However, it was permissible for the Minister take the decision not to consider exercising his power under s 417(1) by laying down guidelines as to the classes of case that were not to be referred to him ( Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, discussed further below), and because of s 417(7), the jurisdiction-denying provisions, whether found in the former s 476(2) or in the present ss 474(1), (2) and (7), 476(2) and 476A(1)(a), cannot be avoided in relation to the Minister's decision by resort to the notion of jurisdictional error.</text>

<tocase>Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75</tocase>
<text>64 Ms Connolly's decision is not something provided for by the Act, and does not itself affect legal rights; cf Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 335 338. The decision of Ms Connolly is not susceptible to judicial review. The only decision that might conceivably be susceptible to judicial review is that of the Minister. However, it was permissible for the Minister take the decision not to consider exercising his power under s 417(1) by laying down guidelines as to the classes of case that were not to be referred to him ( Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, discussed further below), and because of s 417(7), the jurisdiction-denying provisions, whether found in the former s 476(2) or in the present ss 474(1), (2) and (7), 476(2) and 476A(1)(a), cannot be avoided in relation to the Minister's decision by resort to the notion of jurisdictional error.

65 In Savouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1059 , Katz J noted that Merkel J's conclusion in Ozmanian FCA that s 417 required the Minister personally to decide not to consider exercising the power under s 417(1) was rejected by the Full Court in Bedlington v Chong . (I think it plain that his Honour was directing his attention to the question of a decision not to exercise the power in the individual case.) Katz J added (at [31]):
 'However, the rejection of Merkel J's conclusion on that matter appears, if anything, to make his conclusion about the unreviewability of the Departmental officer's decision by reason of the combined effect of para 475(2)(e) of the Act and subs 485(1) of the Act easier to accept.'

66 Katz J said that he found nothing in the reasons for judgment of the Full Court in either Ozmanian FCAFC or Bedlington v Chong that caused him to doubt correctness of the reasoning of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA on the particular question of the combined effect of para 475(2)(e) of the Act and subs 485(1) of the Act. Katz J accepted the correctness of that reasoning and applied it to the decision said to have been made by Mr Fontana, who occupied a position in the Ministerial Interventions Unit, perhaps that occupied by Ms Connolly in the present case.

67 An alternative basis on which the respondents contend that the proceeding must fail is that the applicants cannot obtain the relief they seek. The foundation of this submission is that s 417 does not contain any provision for the making of a request or application to the Minister that would trigger a legal obligation on anyone to consider it.

68 I accept the respondents' submission that if Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA , intended to suggest that the Minister was under a duty to decide whether to consider each individual request for the exercise of the s 417(1) power, that suggestion cannot stand with the reasoning of the Full Court in Bedlington v Chong (which concerned the then s 48B of the Act, a comparable provision to s 417). A Full Court of the Federal Court there held that it was within the competence of the Minister to lay down guidelines for determining whether any request for the exercise of the power conferred by s 48B(1) should be referred to him. The Court held that such guidelines constitute a determination by the Minister, in advance, of the circumstances in which he will consider exercising the power (at 80).

69 Their Honours said (at 80 81) that so long as the Secretary was acting within the guidelines, she had no duty to refer a request to the Minister. Their Honours added that, in saying this, they should not be understood as indicating that even if the Secretary did not act in accordance with guidelines, Ms Chong would be entitled to any relief a matter that was not before their Honours. They added that in so far as Ms Chong's application for relief was based solely on the Secretary's failure to bring her application to the Minister's attention, or on any failure of the Minister to consider her application, it must be dismissed.

70 In their submissions, the applicants attack Ms Connolly's decision not to bring their request to the Minister's attention, relying on jurisdictional error. They rely on various grounds of such error, including a failure to adhere to the Guidelines by not paying due regard to the position of the children, a failure to take into account relevant considerations and a failure to accord procedural fairness. But for reasons previously given, in my opinion, the decision of Ms Connolly is not subject to judicial review, even if such grounds exist.

71 Proposed Order 1 is not available to the applicants. As noted above at [64], the Act did not empower Ms Connolly to make decisions, and the decision that she did make did not affect legal rights.

72 Proposed Order 2 is not available to the applicants because they do not have visas permitting them to remain in Australia that the Minister and the Secretary are threatening to disregard by removing them from Australia.

73 Proposed Order 3 is not available to the applicants because the Minister has decided not to exercise his s 417(1) power, according to a r&eacute;gime that is permissible: see Bedlington v Chong , above [68].

74 Proposed Order 4 is not available to the applicants because there is no obligation on Ms Connolly to bring the applicants' repeat request to the notice of the Minister. As discussed above, the Minister has decided not to exercise his s 417(1) power in cases in which, relevantly and in effect, Ms Connolly should be of a certain opinion, and he intended that she should not bring repeat requests to his attention in cases in which she should be of that opinion. In view of s 417(7), it was entirely a matter for the Minister whether to establish a r&eacute;gime that depended on the subjective opinion of Ms Connolly.

75 For the reasons given above, the application should be dismissed with costs. 


 I certify that the preceding seventy-five (75) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.

<tocase>Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560</tocase>
<text>39 As in the present case, the respondents submitted that this Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding, relying on s 476(2) of the Act set out at [16] above. They submitted that Ms Connolly's actions were those of the Minister in accordance with the principles established in Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560 (' Carltona '), that is to say, that the Minister, acting through Ms Connolly had decided not to consider the repeat request. Accordingly, they submitted, s 476(2) deprived the Court of jurisdiction.

42 In S1083 of 2003, Moore J summarised the conclusions of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA in a series of dot points, which, with some rearrangement and comment by me, were as follows: 

&#8226; s 417 provided for three kinds of decision a decision to exercise the power under s 417(1), a decision not to do so, and a decision not to consider whether to do so (at 118);
 
&#8226; the Carltona principle is not applicable to any of the classes of decision under s 417, and, relevantly, although power to make the third class of decision may be delegated under s 496 of the Act, it had not been (at 120, 121);
 
&#8226; as a matter of fact, however, the Minister's senior adviser was authorised by the Minister to make and to communicate the third class of decision (at 127);
 
&#8226; a decision of the third class that was in fact made by a Departmental or Ministerial officer could not be treated as a decision of the Minister by the operation of the Carltona principle (at 121);
 
&#8226; the Carltona principle had no application in a legislative context where the Minister had a general power to delegate powers, including the power to decide not to consider the exercise of the s 417(1) power (at 120 - 121);
 
&#8226; even though the decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power was not made by the Minister, it was nonetheless a decision of 'the Minister' for the purpose of s 475(2)(e) (at 127);
 
&#8226; it followed that the limit on jurisdiction created by s 485(1), denied the Court jurisdiction under s 5 of the AD(JR) Act in relation to that decision (at 128);
 
&#8226; notwithstanding, the limit on jurisdiction did not deny the Court jurisdiction under s 6 of the AD(JR) Act in relation to conduct engaged in for the purposes of the Minister's making a decision under s 417 (at 134).

43 Merkel J approached the matter on the basis that he could grant relief in respect of conduct under s 6 of the AD(JR) Act, because there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice by Departmental officers in their consideration of the request.

44 In Ozmanian FCAFC , a Full Court allowed an appeal against Merkel J's decision. Sackville J, with whom Jenkinson and Kiefel JJ agreed, considered that 'the words "in respect of ... decisions covered by s 475(2)", as used in s 485(1) are wide enough to embrace conduct leading to a decision not to consider exercising the Minister's powers' (at 15 16).</text>

<tocase>Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 147 ALR 673</tocase>
<text>49 The present applicants rely on the holding by Merkel J that a decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power must be made by the Minister or by the Minister's properly authorised delegate. In addition to relying on the reasoning of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA , they refer to the approval of his Honour's reasoning in the present respect by Wilcox J in Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 147 ALR 673.

50 The applicants' present submission does not take into account Merkel J's other holding (at 125 128) to the effect that, even though the decision not to consider exercising the power had not been made by the Minister or his duly appointed delegate as required by the Act, it was nonetheless a decision made under the authority of, and in purported reliance on, s 417, and was therefore a decision 'of' the Minister for the purposes of the jurisdiction-denying provisions contained in the then ss 475(2)(e) and 485(1) of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>51 The applicants rely on Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 (' Plaintiff S157/2002 '). In substance, the applicants submit that s 474, as interpreted in Plaintiff S157/2002, has the effect that the jurisdiction-denying provision of s 476(2) is not attracted where jurisdictional error exists, because that which would otherwise be 'a decision of the Minister not to exercise, or not to consider the exercise, of the Minister's power under ... section ... 417', is not such a decision at all.

52 Before I address this argument, I will consider the alternative legislative basis for the respondents' contention that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding.

53 This alternative basis assumes, contrary to the respondents' primary submission, that s 476(2) is not the relevant jurisdiction-denying provision, but that the position is governed by the Act as it exists today.

59 I recounted his Honour's reliance on Ozmanian FCA and Ozmanian FCAFC at [40] [46] above. With respect, I agree with his Honour, subject to my returning to the applicants' argument concerning Plaintiff S157/2002 , which I will now address.

60 The first point to notice is that, if the current Part 8 applies, rather than the former s 476(2), even a purported privative clause decision is excluded from the Court's jurisdiction. On any reckoning, the decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power was a purported privative clause decision.

61 If the former s 476(2) is governing, or if the present ss 474(1), (2) and (7), 476(2) and 476A(1)(a) apply but the argument based on 'purported' does not conclude the matter, the question that arises is whether the decision not to consider whether to exercise the s 417(1) power is vitiated for jurisdictional error in accordance with Plaintiff S157/2002 . In my opinion, it cannot be. The reason turns on the express provision in s 417(7) that the Minister does not, in any circumstances, have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under s 417(1).

62 The Minister could have decided not to consider any requests for the exercise of his power under s 417(1) for a specified period of time, and that decision would not have been subject to review. In the present case, his decision not to consider exercising that power was of a more limited kind. It is plain that the Minister's intention, as expressed in his note of 14 August 2003 relating specifically to this case, and in paras 6.5.7 and 6.5.11 of Guidelines MSI 387, was to decide not to consider exercising the power in the case of any request where the criteria of 'unique or exceptional circumstances' were not met 'in the opinion of the assessing officer' (his note of 14 August 2003) or where it 'appears' or is 'found' (to or by the relevant officer) (respectively Guidelines MSI 387 paras 6.5.7 and 6.5.11) that they are not met.

63 The Minister's decision not to consider exercising his power under s 417(1) in the particular case of the applicants comprises his decision just referred to operating upon the subjective judgment formed by Ms Connolly. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the 'unique or 'exceptional circumstances' criterion was not met, the Minister did not wish to consider exercising his s 417(1) power. The applicants do not suggest that Ms Connolly did not act in good faith.</text>

<tocase>S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1455</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1455.html</AustLII>
<text>38 In S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1455 (' S1083 of 2003 '), the facts were similar to those of the present case, the respondents were in substance the same, and the same counsel appeared for the applicants and the respondents. In that case, as in the present one, Ms Connolly did not to pass on to the Minister a request for the exercise of the Minister's power under s 417(1). The applicants sought the following orders under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the AD(JR) Act'): 
 
 
 '1. An order compelling the Manager [Ms Connolly] to consider the applicants' request under section 417 of the Migration Act ... in accordance with the Guidelines issued by the Minister and to bring the s 417 application to the attention of the Minister in order that the Minister can decide whether or not to consider exercising the Minister's power. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. An order prohibiting the Minister and the Secretary from acting upon or giving any further effect to the Manager's failure to bring the s 417 application to the attention of the Minister, and prohibiting the Minister and the Secretary from removing the applicants from Australia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. An order compelling the Secretary to consider the s 417 application in accordance with the Minister's guidelines and to ensure that the Manager deals with the s 417 application in accordance with the Minister's guidelines.'</text>

(I think it plain that his Honour was directing his attention to the question of a decision not to exercise the power in the individual case.) Katz J added (at [31]):
 'However, the rejection of Merkel J's conclusion on that matter appears, if anything, to make his conclusion about the unreviewability of the Departmental officer's decision by reason of the combined effect of para 475(2)(e) of the Act and subs 485(1) of the Act easier to accept.'</text>
