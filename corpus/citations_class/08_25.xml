<text>8 In the course of submissions, the applicants suggested that they should be awarded costs on a solicitor and client basis, but there are no circumstances in this case which warrant such an order ( Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225; NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77.</text>

<tocase>Foots v Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 56</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/56.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) took a broader view of the exceptions to the usual order or circumstances in which it is not made. Gaudron and Gummow JJ said (at 88 [40]):
 
 There is no absolute rule with respect to the exercise of the power conferred by a provision such as s 69 of the Court Act that, in the absence of disentitling conduct, a successful party is to be compensated by the unsuccessful party. Nor is there any rule that there is no jurisdiction to order a successful party to bear the costs of the unsuccessful party.
 

(See also at 120-123 [134] per Kirby J and Foots v Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 56 at [26] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ.)

11 The observations of the High Court were made in the context of s 69(2) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (NSW), but I think it is clear enough that those observations apply equally to the empowering provision in this case, namely, s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

12 The cross-respondents Mr Michael Gargan, Selected Seeds and Top End Rural Supplies submit that the usual order should be made in this case. In the course of their submissions they also submitted that the application for separate trials was premature.

13 The applicants submit that costs should be awarded in their favour because the application would have succeeded had Selected Seeds (in its application for leave to defend) not put forward an arguable plea of proportionate liability on 25 July 2007. There is an analogy here with costs thrown away. The applicants submit that their costs associated with the application are in effect wasted costs because had Selected Seeds raised the arguable plea of proportionate liability earlier, they would not have been incurred (see the discussion of costs thrown away in G E Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2003) [p 23] [14.36]).

14 The relevant events in chronological order are as follows.

15 The applicants commenced this proceeding on 3 April 2006, and issued their application for an order for separate trials on 24 November 2006. As at the latter date, Landmark had filed a defence and issued a cross-claim against Mr Michael Gargan. On 15 September 2006, Mr Michael Gargan issued cross-claims against Simon and Kate Gargan, Selected Seeds, Australian Premium Seeds Pty Ltd, Seed Testing Laboratory of Australia Pty Ltd, and the State of Queensland. On 16 November 2006, Selected Seeds issued cross-claims against Simon and Kate Gargan and Seed Testing Laboratory of Australia Pty Ltd and a new party to the proceeding, Top End Rural Supplies Pty Ltd.

16 It is reasonable to infer that the applicants issued their application after the cross-claims were issued, and after it had become apparent that the whole proceeding would not be ready for trial for some time and, in the applicants' view, would involve a number of issues which were not issues in their claim against Landmark.</text>

<text>8 In the course of submissions, the applicants suggested that they should be awarded costs on a solicitor and client basis, but there are no circumstances in this case which warrant such an order ( Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225; NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77.</text>

<tocase>Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/11.html</AustLII>
<text>9 The application was unsuccessful. The usual order as to costs in those circumstances is that the costs of the successful party to an application are paid by the unsuccessful party: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 (" Oshlack ") at 96-97 [66]-[68] per McHugh J. There are exceptions to the usual order or circumstances in which it is not made. The difference between the majority and minority in Oshlack was as to the width of the exceptions to the usual order or circumstances in which it is not made. McHugh J (with whom Brennan CJ was in general agreement) was in the minority and he said (at 97-98 [69]-[70]) (footnotes omitted):
 
 The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion. In Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd , Devlin J formulated the relevant principle as follows:
 
 
 
 "No doubt, the ordinary rule is that, where a plaintiff has been successful, he ought not to be deprived of his costs, or, at any rate, made to pay the costs of the other side, unless he has been guilty of some sort of misconduct." 
 
 
 
 'Misconduct' in this context means misconduct relating to the litigation, or the circumstances leading up to the litigation. Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation; unnecessarily protracts the proceedings; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court; prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute.
 
 Apart from anomalous examples in the equity jurisdiction, there are very few, if any, exceptions to the usual order as to costs outside the area of disentitling conduct.</text>

<tocase>Shrimp v Landmark Operations Limited [2007] FCA 1468</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1468.html</AustLII>
<text>4 I published reasons for making those orders: Shrimp v Landmark Operations Limited [2007] FCA 1468 and those reasons should be read with these reasons.

5 The relevant parties have now made submissions on the questions of costs reserved in the above orders. Having considered the submissions, I will make the following orders as to costs:
1. On the applicants' notice of motion dated 24 November 2007:
 
 
 1. Landmark Operations Limited, Mr Michael Gargan, Selected Seeds Pty Ltd and Top End Rural Supplies Pty Ltd be jointly and severally liable to pay the applicants' costs of and incidental to the notice of motion to be taxed in default of agreement.
 2. Each of the parties liable under the above order be at liberty to apply for orders as to the appropriate contribution to the said costs as between them.
 
 
 
 2. On Selected Seeds Pty Ltd's notice of motion dated 29 March 2007 the costs of the notice of motion be reserved save and except that there be no order as to the costs of the hearing on 13 July 2007. 
 
 
 
 

Similar orders to those to be made on Selected Seeds' notice of motion dated 29 March 2007 will be made on the notices of motion of Top End Rural Supplies and Mr Michael Gargan, respectively.

6 My reasons for making these orders follow.</text>
