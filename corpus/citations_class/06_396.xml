<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194</tocase>
<text>17 Mr Spencer submitted that he had sought on a number of occasions to suggest a reasonable basis upon which this proceeding could be settled, and that the ACCC had acted unreasonably in refusing to engage with him. He referred to Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 where Hill J summarised the principles that would ordinarily apply with regard to costs when a proceeding has not gone to trial. His Honour said:
 
 "These cases seem to me support the following propositions being made. 
 
 
 
 (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order: Stratford [ J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547] and the SEQEB case [ South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported, Federal Court, 10 February 1989, Pincus J)] . 
 (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits or, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford . This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. 
 (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ( SEQEB ). 
 (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh (1933) 33 SR (NSW) 371. 
 (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd [1973] 1 NSWLR 603 at 606, a case which, however, depended upon the specific working of the statute under consideration."</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/6.html</AustLII>
<text>18 Mr Spencer also drew attention to a similar statement of principle by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 626.

19 Mr Spencer argued that he had at all times acted reasonably in relation to the complaint brought against him by the ACCC. When the matter was first drawn to his attention, by a letter dated 14 April 2003 setting out the ACCC's concerns, he had caused his solicitors to reply to that letter, on 20 May 2003, responding in detail to the allegations. On 11 June 2003, the ACCC had written to his solicitors, thanking them for his response. That letter went on to say:
 
 "This office is currently assessing the information provided by you on behalf of your client. However, it is apparent a number of issues remain, therefore as soon as this office has completed its assessment of your response I will contact you to arrange a mutually suitable time to meet with you and your client to discuss this matter further."

20 It appears from the correspondence that was tendered before me that, despite the suggestion that there would be a meeting between the ACCC and Mr Spencer to discuss the matter further, no such meeting took place. Instead, on 11 August 2004, Deacons, acting on behalf of the ACCC, wrote to Mr Spencer's solicitors informing them that the matter had now been "fully investigated" and that the ACCC had determined to pursue it further. The letter went on to say that a proceeding had been instituted in the Federal Court that day, and enclosed a copy of the application and statement of claim.</text>

<tocase>One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/270.html</AustLII>
<text>14 The ACCC submitted that the principles governing the award of costs in cases where a matter does not proceed to a final hearing were correctly expounded by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 553:
 
 "In my opinion, it is important to draw a distinction between cases in which one party, after litigating for some time, effectively surrenders to the other, and cases where some supervening event or settlement so removes or modifies the subject of the dispute that, although it could not be said that one side has simply won, no issue remains between the parties except that of costs. In the former type of case, there will commonly be lacking any basis for an exercise of the Court's discretion otherwise than by an award of costs to the successful party. It is the latter type of case which more often creates problems, since there may be difficulty in discerning a clear reason why one party, rather than the other, should bear the costs. "

15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading "Futility", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified.

32 In my view, this case falls squarely within the first category of case articulated by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation . The appropriate order is that the second respondent pay the applicant's costs, any such costs to be taxed in default of agreement. 
 


 I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.

<tocase>Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/997.html</AustLII>
<text>9 In broad terms, the Federal Court Rules provide that where a party discontinues proceedings without the leave of the Court, the discontinuing party is liable to pay costs, unless the Court orders otherwise: see O 22 r 2 and 3, and O 62 r 26(1). No such rule is provided for where a proceeding is discontinued with the leave of the Court, although the starting point in principle is that the discontinuing party should meet the costs of the respondent: see Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37 per Stone J at [44].

10 However, the starting point in resolving the issue is this case, namely who should bear the costs when a proceeding has been resolved by the making of consent orders, must be to consider the extent to which the ACCC succeeded in obtaining the relief that was initially sought. In that regard, the position is clear. Mr Spencer consented to the making of declarations by the Court that a series of agreements entered into by Contact Plus constituted "franchise agreements" within the meaning of clause 4 of the Code. He also consented to the making of declarations that Contact Plus had contravened the Code and therefore s 51AD of the Act , by failing to provide disclosure documents, and by failing to receive written and signed statements by the franchisees, as required. In addition, he consented to the making of directions regarding the termination of these franchise agreements, and other breaches of the Code.

11 The Court also declared, by consent, that Contact Plus had engaged in conduct that contravened ss 52 and 53 (g) of the Act regarding the representations made concerning the licence fee of $60,000 and the right of a franchisee to an area that was exclusive to that franchisee. Mr Spencer was declared to have aided, abetted, counselled or procured these contraventions of the Act , and to have been directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, those contraventions.

12 A statement of agreed facts was appended to the consent orders that were sought. That statement contains findings of fact for the purposes of s 83 of the Act .

13 Finally, Mr Spencer agreed to injunctions in the terms sought, which would run for a period of three years from the date of the order made. He accepted orders that required him to provide each person with whom Contact Plus had entered into an agreement similar in terms to those of the franchise agreements that were the subject of this proceeding with a disclosure document that complied with the requirements of the Code, and a copy of the orders of the Court.

15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading "Futility", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified.</text>
