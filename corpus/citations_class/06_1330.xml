<text>This unusual application is for vesting of disclaimed real property in fee simple pursuant to s 568F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The starting point for discussion of the disclaimer provisions in modern times was the analysis by Sir Nigel Bowen in Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd (in liq) [1977] 2 NSWLR 652, dealing with the provisions of the Companies Act 1961 as they stood in 1976. The dicta of Young CJ in Eq in Sullivan v Energy Services International Pty Ltd (in liq) [2002] NSWSC 937 ; (2002) 171 FLR 106, (2002) 43 ACSR 179, particularly at [33] [50], is also of some relevance. His Honour said that there had not been any judicial consideration of s 568F of the current Act (although cf Global Television Pty Ltd v Sportsvision Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) (2000) 35 ACSR 484 [70]). There is a cognate power in bankruptcy (cf Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), s 133(9) ; see National Bank Ltd v Leroy; In the matter of Woo [2003] FCA 862).

The usual position upon disclaimer would be that the company's interest in the property would estreat to the Crown in right of New South Wales subject to any charges ( Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd at 662 663; Re Tulloch Ltd (in liq) (1977) 3 ACLR 808; National Bank Ltd v Leroy; In the matter of Woo at [5]). The State of New South Wales has been joined and submits to any order that the Court might make. It does not seek to press any claim it may have.</text>
