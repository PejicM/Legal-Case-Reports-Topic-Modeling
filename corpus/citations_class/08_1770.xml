<text>33 The Full Court noted that, because of the construction given in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 by of the majority of the Court to what is now O 8 r 3(2)(c), a finding that there was a prima facie case on one aspect of the claim against Mr Bangad has the consequence that he may be proceeded against on other bases as well. That is because it is only necessary that a prima facie case be established for any one of the causes of action relied on for the relief sought: Bray 130 FCR at [47]-[55] per Carr J, [176]-[191] per Branson J: Ho [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 at [45] - [46] .</text>

<text>10 As Allsop J pointed out in Heilbrunn v Lightwood plc (2007) 164 FCR 1 at 6-9 ([30]-[40]) s 4(3)(f) is to be given a wide and liberal construction in accordance with a similar view expressed by the House of Lords in The Antonis P Lemos [1985] AC 711 and Gatoil International Ltd v Arkwright-Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company [1985] AC 255. The Australian Law Reform Commission had referred to their Lordships' decisions in its Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction, Report No 33 (1986) (the ALRC report). Earlier, Foster J observed in Port of Geelong Authority v The "Bass Reefer" [1992] FCA 378 ; (1992) 37 FCR 374 at 380-382 showed the words of s 4(3)(f) are also similar to Article 1(1)(d) of the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships 1952 . In The St Elefterio [1957] P 179 at 183, Willmer J held that the English analogue to s 4(3)(f) encompassed a claim whether in contract or tort "arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship" (emphasis added). In that case, he held that it gave the Court jurisdiction where a person allegedly made a fraudulent ante-dating of bills of lading.</text>

<tocase>Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 ; [2006] FCAFC 159</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/159.html</AustLII>
<text>32 The Suzlon companies argued that the evidence before me (from the part-heard, but now resolved, motion which I dealt with on 4 November 2008, together with the additional emails provided with written submissions after the further hearing of this application on 12 November 2008) established a sufficient case for service outside the jurisdiction to satisfy the requirements of O 8 r 3(2)(b) and (c). These requirements were summarised by Finn and Weinberg JJ and myself in Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 ; [2006] FCAFC 159 at [10] in the following terms:
 As has been observed on many occasions, the prima facie case requirement has to be met at the outset, usually on an ex parte basis, and without the advantage of discovery and other procedural aids to the making out of a case: see e.g. Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Specialty Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 at 390. It "should not call for a substantial inquiry": WSGAL Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 39 FCR 472 at 476; see also Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that a prima facie case for relief is made out if, on the material before the court, inferences are open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed: Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (in liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 110. Or, to put the matter more prosaically as Lee J did in Century Insurance (in provisional liquidation) v New Zealand Guardian Trust [1996] FCA 376: 
 
 "What the Court must determine is whether the case made out on the material presented shows that a controversy exists between the parties that warrants the use of the Court's processes to resolve it and whether causing a proposed respondent to be involved in litigation in the Court in Australia is justified."

33 The Full Court noted that, because of the construction given in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 by of the majority of the Court to what is now O 8 r 3(2)(c), a finding that there was a prima facie case on one aspect of the claim against Mr Bangad has the consequence that he may be proceeded against on other bases as well. That is because it is only necessary that a prima facie case be established for any one of the causes of action relied on for the relief sought: Bray 130 FCR at [47]-[55] per Carr J, [176]-[191] per Branson J: Ho [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 at [45] - [46] .

44 I was satisfied that on the material before me, inferences were open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed on each of the bases in the claims falling within items 5, 6 and 18 described above: Ho [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 at [10] .

45 On the material before me, the inference was available that Mr Bangad was unable to explain to his employer, or to Mr den Hartog, the commercial justification for the impugned documents and the relationship they evidenced between the Suzlon and Headway companies. If Mr den Hartog gave evidence to the effect of the material in his emails, an inference could be drawn that he, on behalf of Beluga, had been misled into entering into the transactions for the carriage of goods to Port Kembla on the basis that he understood that the Headway companies were associated with, rather than independent and at arms length from, the Suzlon companies. That inference would be supported, in the absence of explanation, by the fact that Suzlon Infrastructure guaranteed Headway Shipping's performance of the time charter, apparently before it was even made. If the transactions were at arms length, an explanation would be needed, which is not presently before me, as to why Suzlon Infrastructure would guarantee a time charter entered into by Headway Shipping with Beluga for the time charter of the Beluga Fantastic . There was no evidence of any reward or benefit passing to Suzlon Infrastructure or any other Suzlon company for this guarantee. The inference was also open that the Headway companies would earn a profit from performing the time charter and carrying the Suzlon companies' goods.

46 It was difficult to see, in the absence of an explanation, the commercial rationale for the related company of the shipper and consignee (both Suzlon companies) guaranteeing the owners under a time charter of the vessel for its performance by the party (Headway Shipping) contracting with the shipper for the carriage of its goods to Australia.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1996/1256.html</AustLII>
<text>38 I am satisfied that the allegations of fraud against Mr Bangad in the Suzlon companies' cross-claim, as well as the centrality of his role in the events on which the Suzlon companies rely to seek relief from the Headway companies' claims, make Mr Bangad a proper and necessary party to the proceedings: see News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd [1996] FCA 1256 ; (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 523G-524F per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; see too Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291 at 316-317, [77] - [78] per McHugh J; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 at 370-372 [27] , [30]-[33] per myself.</text>

<tocase>Owners of "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 5 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/5.html</AustLII>
<text>12 I was satisfied that the Suzlon companies had asserted a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act . That claim arose out of the existence of each of the contracts of affreightment, the time charter, the guarantee and the bills of lading for the MV Beluga Fantastic to carry the cargo to Port Kembla, and also out of the Suzlon companies' challenge to those transactions based on the allegations that they made against the Headway companies and Mr Bangad. The words "arising out of" and "relates to" in s 4(3)(f) are of wide import. They should not be read down: see Owners of "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 5 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 420-421 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The claims made against Mr Bangad had the legal character of maritime claims within s 4(3)(f): Shin Kobe Maru 181 CLR at 426.

13 The Suzlon companies also relied on their claims against Mr Bangad being within the associated jurisdiction of the Court conferred by s 12 of the Admiralty Act as matters of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is "... concerned with the resolution of controversies relating to marine commerce and navigation": Shin Kobe Maru 181 CLR at 424. Contractual or business arrangements of a party to proceedings with third parties are capable of attracting the Court's Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction: Shin Kobe Maru 181 CLR at 425. I was of the opinion that, on the present materials, the claims which the Suzlon companies seek to bring against Mr Bangad were substantive rather than appearing to be remotely or tenuously related to matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction pleaded by and against them: cf: The "Bass Reefer" 37 FCR at 381 per Foster J. I was satisfied that those claims raised a real controversy relating to marine commerce and navigation in which Mr Bangad occupied a central role.</text>

<tocase>Pontifical Society for the Propogation of Faith v Scales [1962] HCA 19 ; (1962) 107 CLR 9</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1962/19.html</AustLII>
<text>47 Of course, one story is good until another is told: Pontifical Society for the Propogation of Faith v Scales [1962] HCA 19 ; (1962) 107 CLR 9 at 20 per Dixon CJ. There may well be explanations for this state of affairs. But, I was satisfied, prima facie, that it was appropriate to permit service on Mr Bangad in India. This was because of the present absence of any explanation of the apparently uncommercial nature of the guarantee of the time charter and Mr Bangad's apparent involvement with the Headway companies when the impugned documents and the transactions, which they evidenced, were made. The prima facie case asserted by the Suzlon companies was further strengthened by the material indicating Mr Bangad's inability to explain to his employer his purposes for his entering into the impugned transactions and his inability, when confronted by Mr den Hartog, to explain why he had told Mr den Hartog that the Suzlon and Headway companies were associated, rather than at arms length, and why Mr den Hartog's letter accepting appointment as a director of Headway Shipping had been backdated.

48 Of course, much of the material currently in evidence had been presented in circumstances of urgency and would not necessarily be admissible in its current form at a final hearing. However, I was satisfied that there was sufficient in the material before me to warrant drawing an inference that they were sufficient to support the exercise of the Court's power to permit service out of the jurisdiction on Mr Bangad.

49 I was fortified in this view because the Headway had accepted that, whatever the strengths and weaknesses of the allegations made by the Suzlon companies, they raised a tribal issue which ought be determined at a five day hearing early next year. That is not to suggest that the Headway companies have not vigorously denied the allegations, as they have. Rather, it revealed the underlying litigious reality that the Suzlon companies had raised a case to be answered against the Headway companies, which have appeared, raising their involvement in the serious claims against Mr Bangad that would, if their case were accepted, translate into findings of fact that would support the grant of the relief they claim. 
 

 I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.
