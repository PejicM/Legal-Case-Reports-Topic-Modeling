<tocase>Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117-11,118</tocase>
<text>28 The formulation of the content of that contract however requires some attention. People do not always conduct their business dealings in classic text book terms of offer and acceptance. In Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117-11,118 McHugh JA (Hope and Mahoney JJA concurring) said:
 
 "... in an ongoing relationship, it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled. Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties' subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties. In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms. It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed." 
 

His Honour also remarked (ibid):
 
 "...it is an error to suppose that merely because something has been done then there is therefore some contract in existence which has thereby been executed ... Nevertheless, a contract may be inferred from the acts and conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words. The question in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties, viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, shows a tacit understanding or agreement. The conduct of the parties, however, must be capable of proving all the essential elements of an express contract." 


These statements were subsequently applied by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [74] - [77] (Heydon JA, Mason P concurring) and the Full Court of the Federal Court in Damevski v Giudice [2003] FCAFC 252 ; (2003) 133 FCR 438 at [82] - [88] (Marshall J, Wilcox J concurring).</text>

<tocase>Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/24.html</AustLII>
<text>29 Applying those principles, in my opinion the Work Trial Agreement in the form sent by Mr Mihelcic to Mr Sutczak on 30 December 1996, including cl 4 set out in [18] above, formed part of the contract which was in force at the time Mr Fowle suffered his injury. The Commonwealth and Comcare by their subsequent conduct, and in particular by meeting all Mr Fowle's wages notwithstanding that he was doing work for the Hydro, impliedly accepted the terms in the Work Trial Agreement. Pre-contractual conduct can cast light on the genesis of the contract and its objective aim: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352 , Brambles at [24]. Here the essence of the term appeared in the original Work Trial Agreement ([11] above), which had been prepared by the Commonwealth. Subsequently the Hydro, through Mr Sutczak, emphasised the importance of indemnity ([17] above). The potential for workplace injury, and liability there for, was an obvious matter of concern for a substantial industrial employer like the Hydro.

30 The "liability" in question, a potential liability which might arise at some time in the future, must be the liability of the host employer, the Hydro. "Liability" means any legal liability of the Hydro. Obviously "any injury" does not mean literally any injury suffered by Mr Fowle. An injury which he suffered at home and unconnected with his work would not involve any liability of the Hydro.

31 The expression "liability for any injury" cannot be limited, as the defendants argued, to exclude common law liability. The words are not qualified in any way. It would have been open to Comcare and/or APS, as the preparer of the document, to limit it to accord with their particular circumstances. It is not to the point that entitlement of a Commonwealth employee to sue the Commonwealth for damages at common law is limited in scope and amount by s 45 of the SRC Act. At all relevant times the potential liability of the Hydro included liability at common law for negligence. The Hydro enjoyed no statutory protection comparable to that in s 45 of the Commonwealth Act.</text>

<tocase>Coghlan v S H Lock (Australia) Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 88 at 92</tocase>
<text>33 Counsel for the defendants submitted that the term in question, being an indemnity, should be construed strictly against the Hydro. However, this principle of construction is bound up with another rule, that documents should be construed contra proferentem (against the interest of the party which prepared or drafted the document): Coghlan v S H Lock (Australia) Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 88 at 92, Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [19] , Halford v Price [1960] HCA 38 ; (1960) 105 CLR 23 at 30, 34, 40, 41. However, in the present case it is the Commonwealth which was the drafter or presenter of the document. One can infer that seeking to have a Commonwealth employee placed with an outside employer for the purposes of rehabilitation is a common occurrence. Since this is a benefit to Comcare and the Commonwealth (successful rehabilitation will lessen their financial burden), it is hardly surprising that the Commonwealth and/or Comcare would adopt a standard form of contract in which the outside employer is indemnified against the obvious possibility of liability for workplace injury. The present case is the reverse of the stereotypical situation where the party in the stronger bargaining position imposes a standard term on the weaker party: see Andar at [69] per Kirby J.</text>
