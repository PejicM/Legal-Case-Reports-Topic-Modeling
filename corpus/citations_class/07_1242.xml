<text>33 However, the performance of a public duty or the fulfilment of a public function by a body such as Airservices is different to the performance or fulfilment of private rights or privileges by a private individual or corporation acting in its own interest. If the Court took a strict view of the public duty or function, a deviation from the conditions laid down in the statute would make the act of the public body invalid: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 392 [97] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. The inconvenience to the public which that approach would occasion is a powerful reason against adopting that construction: Clayton v Heffron [1960] HCA 92 ; (1960) 105 CLR 214 at 247 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Windeyer JJ. In Project Blue Sky 194 CLR at 392-393 [99]-[100] the majority held that while the statute there imposed a legal duty on the authority, an act done in breach of the statutory duty was not invalid. But, they held, a person with a sufficient interest could sue for a declaration that the authority had acted in breach of the statute and, in an appropriate case, could obtain an injunction restraining it from taking any further action based on its unlawful conduct.

71 Indeed, the 2005 master plan for Canberra airport contains an ultimate practical capacity ANEF as at 2050 (par 10.5.5 and fig 10.5) and a comparison between the 20 ANEF contours for the 2050 ultimate practical capacity ANEF, the 2024 ANEC ('Australian Noise Exposure Concept') and the former 1997 ANEF (fig 10.6). A master plan which is approved by the Minister becomes a final master plan which comes into force at the time of the approval. It is unlikely that the inclusion of matters in addition or supplementary to those required to be included in a master plan were intended by the Parliament to have the effect of rendering invalid a draft or final master plan: Project Blue Sky 194 CLR at 391 [94] [95]; see too at 381-382 [69] [71], 384 [78] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, Clayton v Heffron 105 CLR at 247 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Windeyer JJ. The consequence of Village's argument is so impracticable that it cannot have been intended in the absence of express words.</text>
