<tocase>D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<text>8 In D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397, the Full Federal Court considered as an 'appropriate litmus test for the general run of cases, in which leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision is sought' (at 399), being the two principles stated in Niemann v Electronic Industries Ltd [1978] VR 431, namely, whether in all the circumstances the interlocutory decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by a court on appeal, and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision be wrong.

9 The Full Court in D&eacute;cor (at 400) also endorsed the proposition that leave will be more readily granted where the decision the subject of appeal determined a ' substantive right ' rather than a ' point of practice '.

10 In the present case, the Federal Magistrate's decision determined points of practice and/or procedure, that is to say, first whether the application purportedly filed on 13 January 2006 was filed in breach of an order of the Federal magistrate Court which required the applicant to first obtain leave of the FMC to appeal, secondly whether that leave should be granted, and thirdly whether the application was incompetent insofar as it related to the decision of the Minister's delegate. The Minister submitted that the court should be reluctant to grant leave in such circumstances.

11 The Minister submitted further that the applicant would need to meet both of the principles enunciated in D&eacute;cor before the Court would be willing to grant the applicant leave to appeal, and moreover that the applicant did not meet either of those principles for the reasons below.

12 The proposed grounds of appeal in the draft notice of appeal merely state general propositions which do not purport to illuminate the basis upon which the applicant would seek to appeal.

13 Moreover there are complaints made in the applicant's written submissions which indicate other proposed grounds of appeal intend to be relied upon. For instance, the applicant asserts a breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) as a result of the Tribunal's alleged failure to put to the applicant pursuant to that section inconsistencies between, inter alia , the applicant's claims in his protection visa application and those made in his oral evidence at the hearing before the RRT.</text>
