<text>10 When considering the decision of an administrative tribunal, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, considerable caution must be exercised in construing the findings and reasons set forth in that decision: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. This approach has since been endorsed: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [25] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 617 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Black v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [36] , [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 9.</text>

<text>10 When considering the decision of an administrative tribunal, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, considerable caution must be exercised in construing the findings and reasons set forth in that decision: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. This approach has since been endorsed: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [25] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 617 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Black v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [36] , [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 9.

13 To construe the reasons provided by the Tribunal as involving an " inconsistency ", it is considered, would be to engage in the " over-zealous judicial review " warned against in Wu Shan Liang. See: Huttner R, Judicial Review of Refugee Decisions: The High Court's Decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 3 AJ Admin L 222. The reasons provided by the Tribunal adequately explain the basis upon which it proceeded.

14 The first Ground of Appeal is therefore rejected.</text>

<text>17 The findings as made by the Tribunal and extracted in the second Ground of Appeal are not " information " which could fall within s 424A(1)(a). This Ground of Appeal is more properly characterised as an impermissible challenge to the merits of the decision made by the Tribunal: NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] per Gray, Tamberlin and Lander JJ.</text>

<text>4 The present decision of the Tribunal, differently constituted, was signed on 25 October 2006 and again affirmed the delegate's decision. On 6 March 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the decision of the reconstituted Tribunal: NBDV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 309.

5 The Appellant now appeals to this Court. His Notice of Appeal relies upon the same two grounds as were before the Federal Magistrates Court, namely:
 
(i) a failure on the part of the Tribunal to " consider the Applicant's refugee claims in a constructive and articulate manner because of ... contradictory findings it made during the assessment of the claims "; and 
 
(ii) a failure to comply with s 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 
For the same reasons as were provided by the learned Federal Magistrate, neither ground is made out and the appeal is dismissed.

6 The Appellant appeared before this Court unrepresented, although he did have the assistance of an interpreter. Previously filed with the Court were written submissions signed by the Appellant and dated 12 May 2008.</text>

15 Section 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides as follows:
 Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must: 
 
 (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; ... 
 
 
Compliance with this provision is mandatory: SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 , 215 ALR 162 ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [13] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 614 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.

18 At best, it is a contention that the Appellant was entitled to be informed of the findings as proposed to be made by the Tribunal and to be afforded a further opportunity to be heard. The Appellant was not entitled to any such further opportunity. Concurrence is expressed with the reliance by the Federal Magistrate upon SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616 and his Honour's conclusion that such findings do not fall within s 424A(1)(a). In SZBYR , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ held:
 [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [[2004] FCAFC 123 , 206 ALR 471 at 477] that the word "information". does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc. If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.

<text>25 Assuming that the written submissions constituted a previously unexpressed application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal , the granting of such leave was opposed by the solicitor appearing for the Respondent Minister. Two principal contentions advanced on behalf of the Minister were that:
 
(a) none of the grounds had been advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court; and 
 
(b) none of the grounds were formulated in such a manner as to be able to be properly understood. 
 
Further, and more specifically, submissions focussed upon the fact that s 91R initially had been raised as a ground before the Federal Magistrates Court and an alternative ground expressly " substituted " in lieu. A party, of course, is generally not entitled to raise new grounds which were deliberately or by inadvertence not put to the court from which an appeal is brought: SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] per Lander J. The contention that there was a failure to " assess information " is simply denied by the very task undertaken by the Tribunal. That, and other grounds, it was submitted were thus without substance, nor was there any specification as to which of the " findings " of the Tribunal were said to have been made without sufficient evidentiary foundation.</text>

<text>26 To entertain the written submissions filed by the Appellant, leave to amend the Notice of Appeal would necessarily have been required. That leave was refused. The submissions as advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister should be accepted. None of the grounds, it is considered, have merit: VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158. That, it should be noted, was the decision communicated to the Appellant during the course of the hearing of the appeal.

27 The orders of the Court are:
 
1. The Appeal be dismissed. 
 
2. The Appellant to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal.
