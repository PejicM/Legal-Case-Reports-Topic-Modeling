<tocase>Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1426.html</AustLII>
<text>14 The applicant seeks to sidestep these problems by relying upon the Commissioner's appeal statement required by O 52B r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . It is submitted that, on the basis that all the facts asserted in the appeal statement are accepted, the applicant can demonstrate that it will carry the burden of proof of establishing that the declaration should not have been made. The applicant relies upon the decision of Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 particularly at [31] and [58] that underlines the importance of the appeal statement and the necessity for it to fully state the basis of the relevant decision, and refers to Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426 at [37] . It is submitted for the Commissioner that an appeal statement should not be used in this way.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1416.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The Commissioner submits that the application is misconceived. In order to succeed the Court must be satisfied that the Commissioner has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding (s 31A(1)(b) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)), although a defence need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success (s 31A(3)). It is clear enough that s 31A is wider than the previous regime for summary judgment had become. Counsel cited a number of decisions that have discussed this provision the latest being Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] per Jacobson J and Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13] per Tamberlin J. However, limited assistance is to be gained from other decisions. "No reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding" is a statutory phrase that does not permit or require paraphrase. Whilst the bar may be lower than it was, it still requires a considerable leap.</text>

<tocase>Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/34.html</AustLII>
<text>17 The applicant submits that it is quite clear that it did not get a "GST benefit" from any scheme that has been or might be identified. An entity only gets a GST benefit if the amount of GST payable by it is, or could reasonably be expected to be, smaller than it would be apart from the scheme or a part of the scheme (s 165-10(1)(a)). That requires adopting a hypothesis as to what would have occurred had the scheme not been entered into. It is submitted that the hypothesis must be reasonable and based upon the evidence ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 385; Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at 412). It is submitted for the applicant that no such hypothesis has been or could be adopted here.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/70.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The applicant contends, as a separate point, that if the applicant received a GST benefit, that benefit was attributable to the making by Holdings of a choice, election or application that is expressly provided for by the GST Act and so Div 165 does not operate by reason of s 165-5(1)(b). Registration for GST purposes is governed by Pt 2-5 of the GST Act. It is submitted that application for cancellation of registration in the approved form was a choice, election or application expressly provided for by s 25-55(1)(a). Reference was made to the decision of the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488 at 514 515 and to the decision of Greenwood J in Walters v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 162 FCR 421 particularly at [83] [85].</text>
