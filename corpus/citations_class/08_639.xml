<tocase>AG Spalding &amp; Bros v AW Gamage Ltd (1915) 84 LJ Ch 449</tocase>
<text>56 For over 150 years it has been the law that "nobody has any right to represent his goods as the goods of somebody else" per Turner LJ in Burgess v Burgess (1853) 22 LJ Ch 675 ; 3 De GM&amp;G 896 at 904; [43] ER 351 at 354: AG Spalding &amp; Bros v AW Gamage Ltd (1915) 84 LJ Ch 449 per Lord Parker of Waddington (with whom Viscount Haldane LC, Lord Atkinson and Lord Sumner concurred): Angelides 40 CLR at 81 per Rich and Starke JJ.

57 Lord Parker identified the basis of a passing off action as a false representation by the defendant that his goods were the plaintiff's. In Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 at [109]-[110] the High Court recognised that the range of the defendant's conduct which could constitute passing off included inducing consumers to believe that the defendant's goods or services had an association, quality or endorsement which belonged, or would belong, to the goods or services of or associated with the plaintiff. As Lord Parker recognised, relevantly here, the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the get-up in question, impliedly represents the defendant's goods to be goods of the plaintiff or associated with the plaintiff, whether generally or in respect of a particular class or quality. In other words, the question is whether the defendant's use of the get-up is calculated to deceive. He pointed out that it would be impossible to enumerate or classify all the possible ways in which a man may make the false representation relied on: Spalding 84 LJ Ch at 450; see too Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361 at 369-370 per Beaumont, Branson and Lindgren JJ; ConAgra 33 FCR at 356 per Gummow J.</text>

<tocase>Apand Pty Ltd v The Kettle Chip Co Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474</tocase>
<text>71 Mere proof of the fact that a person has deliberately copied the name or get-up of a trade rival does not of itself establish a contravention of s 52 or a passing off or goods or services: Apand Pty Ltd v The Kettle Chip Co Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496 per Lockhart, Gummow and Lee JJ. In ConAgra 33 FCR at 374, Gummow J said "[d]eliberate copying does not necessarily indicate fraud. A notable example is provided by Cadbury Schweppes [[1980] 2 NSWLR 851]". And, Lockhart J said ( ConAgra 33 FCR at 345: French J at 377 agreed with both Lockhart J and Gummow J):
 But deliberate copying of the plaintiff's goods does not always evidence an intention to deceive; it may indicate nothing more than realisation that the plaintiff has a useful idea which the defendant can turn to his own advantage, though not intending to pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff.</text>

<tocase>Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1937/51.html</AustLII>
<text>68 In the law of passing off, the courts have treated evidence of the intentions of the defendant as relevant to the question of whether a representation is conveyed. SunRice argued that this evidence was determinative. It relied on remarks of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 657. They said:
 The rule that if a mark or get-up for goods is adopted for the purpose of appropriating part of the trade or reputation of a rival, it should be presumed to be fitted for the purpose and therefore likely to deceive or confuse, no doubt, is as just in principle as it is wholesome in tendency. In a question how possible or prospective buyers will be impressed by a given picture, word or appearance, the instinct and judgment of traders is not to be lightly rejected, and when a dishonest trader fashions an implement or weapon for the purpose of misleading potential customers he at least provides a reliable and expert opinion on the question whether what he has done is in fact likely to deceive. Moreover, he can blame no one but himself, even if the conclusion be mistaken that his trade mark or the get-up of his goods will confuse and mislead the public. But the practical application of the principle may sometimes be attended with difficulty. (emphasis added)

69 However, their Honours concluded that in the end it was still a question of fact for the court to determine whether, indeed, there had been established a reasonable probability of deception or confusion from the use, in that case, of a trademark or device. They held that the main issue in the case was a question which was never susceptible of much discussion. They said ( Australian Woollen Mills 58 CLR at 659; see too Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 220 per O'Connor J; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 30 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at 389 [121] per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, Branson J agreeing; Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window &amp; General Cleaners Ltd (1946) 63 RPC 39 at 40 per Lord Simonds, with whom Lords Wright, Porter and Goddard agreed):
 It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs.

97 Likewise, Mr Young expected the new enhancement to SunRice's rice cake packaging by the addition of the rice representation and words "MADE WITH WHOLEGRAIN RICE" to emphasise potential health benefits to consumers on its various rice cake products. I find this was done because Ricegrowers appreciated that the ordinary reasonable consumer of these products would pay some attention to the packaging beyond merely looking at a colour cue before purchasing. A consumer who intentionally wished to acquire one but purchase the other might feel deceived: cp Australian Woollen Mills 58 CLR at 657. While, of course, SunRice would still sell either its tomato salsa flavoured thin corn cake, or its sundried tomato and basil one, I am satisfied that Ricegrowers took sensible and appropriate precautions in designing the packagings for the two tomato products in order to prevent such confusion occurring. It was not in Ricegrowers' interests that such confusion occur between its own products.

98 The difference between the get-up of the SunRice products and those of the Real Foods ones in competition with them is, to my mind, far more striking than that of the two SunRice tomato-based products. I am satisfied that there was no real possibility of the ordinary reasonable consumer being mislead or deceived or being confused by the get-up or packaging of the cheese flavoured and salt and vinegar flavoured "Corn Thins" products. They are distinctly different from their competitor's products in their get-up and packaging in the cues of the mark "Corn Thins", as well as colour, printing of their descriptions, and pictorial representations.

99 While the green packaging of the original SunRice rice cakes (until the most recent change) was similar to the green which Real Foods adopted for its sour cream and chives corn cakes, the two get-ups are in my view so significantly different that the ordinary reasonable consumer would know immediately on looking at one or the other that they were not the same. The ordinary reasonable consumer looking at the "Corn Thins" sour cream and chives package would know that they were not SunRice's product, or associated at all with the SunRice product that was marketed as its sour cream and chives rice cake.</text>

<tocase>Burford &amp; Sons Ltd v Mowling &amp; Son [1909] HCA 83 ; (1908) 8 CLR 212</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1909/83.html</AustLII>
<text>60 A trader has a prima facie right to put his goods in any packages which he may think attractive and convenient and in any method which he may consider suitable for carrying on his trade provided that the form adopted is not likely to deceive the ordinary reasonable consumer into mistaking his goods for the goods known in the market as manufactured, put up or sold by another: Burford &amp; Sons Ltd v Mowling &amp; Son [1909] HCA 83 ; (1908) 8 CLR 212 at 216 per O'Connor J; affirmed at 8 CLR 222-224 per Griffith CJ, Isaacs and Higgins JJ. O'Connor J said that there the plaintiffs had no monopoly in the particular kind of packing which they adopted, which was used in a large number of articles. Those included not only packed soap, but grocery items and a variety of other items. He also said that the plaintiffs could not acquire a monopoly of the form of package by adopting a particular form of packaging, because its use was open to anyone in the trade. But his Honour went on to say that:
 ... where, as in this case, a certain method of get up, though open to all traders, has been for many years solely identified with the plaintiffs' goods in a particular market, it is incumbent on a trader who adopts the same method of get up for the purpose of pushing his trade and a similar article in the same market, that he shall clearly differentiate his goods on the face of the package from those of the plaintiffs. (Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 217)

61 O'Connor J found that the question for determination was whether the defendant had made the difference of manufacture and ownership clear on the face of the package when adopting cartons of the same material, colour, shape and size of the plaintiff's packaging. He applied what Lindley MR said in Payton &amp; Co Ltd v Snelling Lampard &amp; Co Ltd (1899) 17 RPC 48 at 52. Lindley MR discussed the situation where goods themselves resembled one another, in that case coffee, and were packaged similarly. He said that the issue was not that the defendant's goods or get-up was like the plaintiff's by reason of the features common to them and others. Rather, in a passage cited with approval by O'Connor J in Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 217, in order to succeed in a passing off action, the plaintiff:
 ...must make out that the defendant's are like his by reason of something peculiar to him, and by reason of the defendant having adopted some mark, or device, or label, or something of that kind, which distinguishes the plaintiff's from other goods which have, like his, the features common to the trade. Unless the plaintiff can bring his case up to that, he fails.

63 Thus, the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff: Burford &amp; Sons [1909] HCA 83 ; 8 CLR 212 ; Payton 17 RPC at 56; affirmed [1901] AC 308 ; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 507H-508B per Lord Oliver. Lord Oliver said that it was important in such a case for the defendant to see that the goods could really be distinguished from those of or associated with the plaintiff. But, he said the question was how far the defendants' trademark bears such a resemblance to that of the plaintiff, as to be calculated to deceive incautious purchasers: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509B citing Lord Kingsdown in Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Cloth Co Ltd [1865] EngR 199 ; (1865) 11 H L Cas 523 at 539.

69 However, their Honours concluded that in the end it was still a question of fact for the court to determine whether, indeed, there had been established a reasonable probability of deception or confusion from the use, in that case, of a trademark or device. They held that the main issue in the case was a question which was never susceptible of much discussion. They said ( Australian Woollen Mills 58 CLR at 659; see too Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 220 per O'Connor J; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 30 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at 389 [121] per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, Branson J agreeing; Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window &amp; General Cleaners Ltd (1946) 63 RPC 39 at 40 per Lord Simonds, with whom Lords Wright, Porter and Goddard agreed):
 It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs.

107 I am satisfied that Real Foods differentiated its products on the face of their packages from those of SunRice: Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 21.</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 159 FCR 397</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/70.html</AustLII>
<text>72 In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 159 FCR 397 at 418-419 [96] - [99] Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ observed that the principles relating to passing off do not necessarily require a plaintiff to establish an exclusive reputation in relation to the use of a particular colour, in that case, purple. They said that the question was whether the plaintiff could establish facts that demonstrate that a particular use by the defendant of the colour was likely to mislead or deceive consumers into believing that there was relevant connection between the defendant and the plaintiff or their respective products: Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418 [96]; see too Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 42 per Lord Simonds. They observed that both in the context of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act and the common law tort of passing off, trade indicia other than names and logos can become associated with a particular trader, so that use by another trader could give rise to misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off. They said ( Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418 [97]):
 If particular branding elements used by a trader have been identified in a special way with that trader in the minds of the members of the public, there may be misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of the appropriation of those particular branding elements by another trader.

73 Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ said, obiter, that whether or not there was a requirement for some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing-off, Pt V of the Trade Practices Act did not include such a requirement. Under the Act, the question is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant's product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant's product: Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 419 [99].</text>

<tocase>Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Pub Squash Co Pty Limited [1980] 2 NSWLR 851</tocase>
<text>51 The relevant date for determining whether a plaintiff has established the necessary goodwill or reputation of his product is the date of commencement of the conduct complained of: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Pub Squash Co Pty Limited [1980] 2 NSWLR 851 at 861 per Lord Scarman.

71 Mere proof of the fact that a person has deliberately copied the name or get-up of a trade rival does not of itself establish a contravention of s 52 or a passing off or goods or services: Apand Pty Ltd v The Kettle Chip Co Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496 per Lockhart, Gummow and Lee JJ.

<tocase>Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/12.html</AustLII>
<text>52 In these proceedings SunRice seeks only equitable relief in respect of the claim for passing off; it has abandoned any claim for damages and seeks only an account and injunctive relief. Thus, the proceedings for passing off seek a remedy to protect against injury to the goodwill built up by the activities of SunRice: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 88 [108] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. And, as their Honours pointed out, the action based on a contravention of s 52 is designed to protect consumers. Whether or not conduct amounts to a representation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what was said, written, and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances: see Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [100], citing Taco Co of Australian Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202 per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ.

53 In this area of the law the courts constantly endeavour to keep pace with the progress of trade by adapting fundamental doctrines to advancing methods and changing circumstances: Angelides v James Stedman Hendersons Sweets Ltd [1927] HCA 34 ; (1927) 40 CLR 43 at 59-60 per Isaacs ACJ; ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 356 per Gummow J; Campomar 202 CLR at 88 [109].

57 Lord Parker identified the basis of a passing off action as a false representation by the defendant that his goods were the plaintiff's. In Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 at [109]-[110] the High Court recognised that the range of the defendant's conduct which could constitute passing off included inducing consumers to believe that the defendant's goods or services had an association, quality or endorsement which belonged, or would belong, to the goods or services of or associated with the plaintiff. As Lord Parker recognised, relevantly here, the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the get-up in question, impliedly represents the defendant's goods to be goods of the plaintiff or associated with the plaintiff, whether generally or in respect of a particular class or quality. In other words, the question is whether the defendant's use of the get-up is calculated to deceive. He pointed out that it would be impossible to enumerate or classify all the possible ways in which a man may make the false representation relied on: Spalding 84 LJ Ch at 450; see too Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361 at 369-370 per Beaumont, Branson and Lindgren JJ; ConAgra 33 FCR at 356 per Gummow J.

66 So, in a claim alleging that a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act has occurred, the court considers the effect on an ordinary reasonable shopper by conduct involving the making of a representation to the class of retail consumers shopping in a supermarket displaying a trader's packaged goods on its shelves: Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [101]-[103]. The court attributes particular characteristics to this shopper. In actions for passing off a similar test applies in assessing whether a representation was made and, if so, what its effect was. So, in Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D Lord Oliver said that this is done against the background of the type of market in which the goods are sold, the manner in which they are sold, and the habits and characteristics of purchasers in that market: see too Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [100].

81 The parties agreed that the ordinary reasonable consumer ( Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [101]-[103]: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D) was described accurately in the packaging brief prepared by Ms Anderson as having the following demographic makeup, namely: the ordinary reasonable consumer of the parties' rice and corn cake products was a female aged between 30 and 49 years. Most would have middle or older families (i.e. school age children or teenagers) but some would not have children; some would be in households with either one or two income earners. She would be working either full-time or part-time, be married and educated. The ordinary reasonable consumer would be purchasing these products as snack foods for herself and her entire family unit. She would be health conscious and would want to set a good example for her family by her healthy eating. She also would be conscious of her weight and would feel guilty when snacking. She would not want to have foods that were full of fat or sugar. Nor would she want to give her children or teenagers such foods or set a bad example for them.

85 The ordinary reasonable consumer was used to seeing the two distinct families of goods presented on the supermarket shelves in this way: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D; Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [100]-[103].

106 Ricegrowers has not demonstrated that Real Foods' use of its packaging was calculated or likely to lead the ordinary reasonable consumer to believe that any of the three corn thin flavoured corn cakes were made by or in some way associated with Ricegrowers or its SunRice products (the sour cream and chives, or sea salt and balsamic vinegar thin flavoured rice cakes or the nacho cheese flavoured corn cake): Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418-419 [96]-[99]; Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 42. The ordinary reasonable consumer would not believe that, to the extent that the packaging of the flavoured Real Foods products was similar, any of those packages emanated from or were in any way associated with Ricegrowers or SunRice: Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 [109]-[110]; Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [22]; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 506F-G; Payton 17 RPC at 51; see too Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 9) [2008] FCA 470 at [88] per Heerey J.

108 There is no reason to conclude that Ricegrowers is entitled to a monopoly on colours and flow packs for the packaging of corn or rice cakes with the features of those on Real Foods' packaging complained of. Here, Real Foods adopted colours and printed flow pack packaging which were in common use in the savoury biscuits category. Just because Ricegrowers was first to use these in the corn cake and rice cake subcategories did not entitle it to a monopoly of their use. Real Foods took sufficient steps, in all the circumstances, to distinguish its flavoured "Corn Thins" from the three conflicting products of SunRice: cp: Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [99]; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Limited v Puxu Pty Limited [1982] HCA 44 ; (1981) 149 CLR 191 at 200 per Gibbs CJ; Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 43. The ordinary reasonable consumer was used to seeing the corn and rice cakes products of the parties displayed standing up in the shelves. The new packaging for the new "Corn Thins" was presented as part of the family or group of products distinct from the SunRice family or group. When one of the "Corn Thins" flavoured corn cakes varieties was placed within the SunRice product display, as is shown in some photographs in evidence, they look noticeably out of place on the shelves and in the wrong "family" or group. I am of opinion that the ordinary reasonable consumer would notice this and realise the products were not related, even if they wondered why the supermarket had displayed them in this way: Hornsby Building Information Centre 140 CLR at 229; Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [21].</text>

<text>58 But, what is protected is a proprietary interest of the plaintiff in his goods or get-up; that is, for the purposes of equitable relief, the goodwill which the plaintiff has built up which the defendant's false representation injures. Mere use of the get-up of another in the selling of goods is not enough. The representation which must be conveyed by the use is that the other's goods or goods associated with him are being sold by the defendant: see Collitt v Borsalino Guiseppe e Fratello SA [1913] HCA 34 ; (1913) 16 CLR 344 at 351 per Barton ACJ, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ.

59 It is not necessary that the persons purchasing the goods should know of the manufacturer by name, and have in mind when they purchased the goods that they are made by that person (or the person they associate with having produced those goods, whether or not the name is known): Collitt 16 CLR at 351. Where a plaintiff's name or get-up acquires a secondary meaning, the defendant's use of the name or get-up conveys the misrepresentation that the goods are the plaintiff's. It is in this way that the plaintiff's goodwill will be injured: Collitt 16 CLR at 359, 361.</text>

55 Their Lordships went on, through Lord Scarman, to say that competition had to remain free and was safeguarded by the necessity for the plaintiff to prove that he has built up an intangible property right which he seeks to protect in the action: Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [23]: see too Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [No 2] [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 445 per Deane J (with whom Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed). In ConAgra 33 FCR at 356 Gummow J said:
 But it is to be observed that the law of passing off contains sufficient nooks and crannies to make it difficult to formulate any satisfactory definition in short form. However, "the classical trinity" does serve to emphasise three core concepts in this area of the law. This appeal is concerned with all of them, namely, the geographical requirements for a sufficient reputation, the nature of the interest damaged, and the significance of fraud in the making of the misrepresentation.

57 Lord Parker identified the basis of a passing off action as a false representation by the defendant that his goods were the plaintiff's. In Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 at [109]-[110] the High Court recognised that the range of the defendant's conduct which could constitute passing off included inducing consumers to believe that the defendant's goods or services had an association, quality or endorsement which belonged, or would belong, to the goods or services of or associated with the plaintiff. As Lord Parker recognised, relevantly here, the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the get-up in question, impliedly represents the defendant's goods to be goods of the plaintiff or associated with the plaintiff, whether generally or in respect of a particular class or quality. In other words, the question is whether the defendant's use of the get-up is calculated to deceive. He pointed out that it would be impossible to enumerate or classify all the possible ways in which a man may make the false representation relied on: Spalding 84 LJ Ch at 450; see too Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361 at 369-370 per Beaumont, Branson and Lindgren JJ; ConAgra 33 FCR at 356 per Gummow J.

71 Mere proof of the fact that a person has deliberately copied the name or get-up of a trade rival does not of itself establish a contravention of s 52 or a passing off or goods or services: Apand Pty Ltd v The Kettle Chip Co Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496 per Lockhart, Gummow and Lee JJ. In ConAgra 33 FCR at 374, Gummow J said "[d]eliberate copying does not necessarily indicate fraud. A notable example is provided by Cadbury Schweppes [[1980] 2 NSWLR 851]". And, Lockhart J said ( ConAgra 33 FCR at 345: French J at 377 agreed with both Lockhart J and Gummow J):
 But deliberate copying of the plaintiff's goods does not always evidence an intention to deceive; it may indicate nothing more than realisation that the plaintiff has a useful idea which the defendant can turn to his own advantage, though not intending to pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff.</text>

<text>64 In Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 514H-515C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders. Thus, the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his. He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public, but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design. He referred to JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765 at 771 per Cozens-Hardy MR and at 774 per Farwell LJ. In that case, at 773, Fletcher Moulton LJ had said there that the get-up of an article meant a capricious addition to the article itself, such as the colour or shape or wrapper or anything of that kind: see too Doctor Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 281 at 369 [339] per Goldberg J; and Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 515C-D per Lord Jauncey.</text>

<tocase>Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216</tocase>
<text>74 But for passing off or a contravention of s 52 to occur the defendant must make a false representation that the defendant's goods are the plaintiff's or are associated in some way with the plaintiff. The focus of s 52 is on the misleading of others, rather than upon an injury to a competitor: Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 228 per Stephen J.

75 In cases of passing off where the wrongful appropriation of the reputation of the plaintiff or that of his goods is in question, a plaintiff who used descriptive words in his trade name would find out that quite small differences in a competitor's trade name would render the latter immune from action. The law recognises the possibility of blunders by members of the public when descriptive words are used by two traders as part of their respective trade names. But, Stephen J said the risk of confusion must be accepted because "... to do otherwise is to give to one who appropriates to himself descriptive words an unfair monopoly in those words and might even deter others from pursuing the occupation which the words describe": Hornsby Building Information Centre 140 CLR at 229. And, he said that similar principles applied to s 52 , because allowing that section to be used as an instrument for the creation of a monopoly of descriptive names "... would be to mock the manifest intent of the legislation": 140 CLR at 230. The principle is not limited to a name but applies to other descriptive material if it has not given a distinctive character to a product or business: Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [21] per Lord Scarman. I am of opinion that a similar principle applies to the use of a get-up in which the plaintiff has no proprietary interest or goodwill i.e. where he has not created a secondary meaning associating the plaintiff or his goods with the get-up.

108 There is no reason to conclude that Ricegrowers is entitled to a monopoly on colours and flow packs for the packaging of corn or rice cakes with the features of those on Real Foods' packaging complained of. Here, Real Foods adopted colours and printed flow pack packaging which were in common use in the savoury biscuits category. Just because Ricegrowers was first to use these in the corn cake and rice cake subcategories did not entitle it to a monopoly of their use. Real Foods took sufficient steps, in all the circumstances, to distinguish its flavoured "Corn Thins" from the three conflicting products of SunRice: cp: Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [99]; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Limited v Puxu Pty Limited [1982] HCA 44 ; (1981) 149 CLR 191 at 200 per Gibbs CJ; Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 43. The ordinary reasonable consumer was used to seeing the corn and rice cakes products of the parties displayed standing up in the shelves. The new packaging for the new "Corn Thins" was presented as part of the family or group of products distinct from the SunRice family or group. When one of the "Corn Thins" flavoured corn cakes varieties was placed within the SunRice product display, as is shown in some photographs in evidence, they look noticeably out of place on the shelves and in the wrong "family" or group. I am of opinion that the ordinary reasonable consumer would notice this and realise the products were not related, even if they wondered why the supermarket had displayed them in this way: Hornsby Building Information Centre 140 CLR at 229; Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [21].</text>

<tocase>Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 546 ; (1993) 46 FCR 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/546.html</AustLII>
<text>67 And, as Burchett J noted in Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 546 ; (1993) 46 FCR 152 at 161:
 Of course, a person who places the packets before him, side by side, can also see differences. But that is not how passing off by the imitation of another trader's mark or get-up is to be tested. In general, and more particularly in the case of an item likely to be purchased for a small price without long consideration, the comparison which must be made is between the impression of the applicant's goods retained in a customer's mind and the impression made by the sort of consideration he is likely to give to the respondent's product before purchasing it.

79 Ricegrowers argued that the circumstances of the purchase of the competing products by the ordinary reasonable consumer included the following:
 
 
 &#8226; each of the products was low in price and a routine purchase likely to appear on the ordinary reasonable consumer's shopping list. It was likely to be bought, along with many other items, whilst the weekly shopping was being done. For the ordinary reasonable consumer, looking to purchase this type of snack food, the shopping process is a "low involvement" one. Low involvement purchases are ones which are made frequently, or sometimes on impulse and typically do not involve a large price;
 &#8226; the ordinary reasonable shopper has a hierarchy of cues which she uses, even in low involvement purchases when shopping very fast, in order to identify the goods she is purchasing. Ms Anderson said the cues provide shortcuts for the different categories. One such cue is the use of colour packaging of food stuffs such green for sour cream and chives;
 &#8226; Ricegrowers argued that when Ms Anderson prepared the marketing brief with The Leading Edge, she said that "Corn Thins" were a routine purchase, the shopping process was generally low involvement and there were shortcuts or cues which aided purchase such as familiar brands, colours, packaging, flavours and claims (e.g. the product was 97% fat free and the claims made in the nutritional information panel on the package); 
 &#8226; the packaging of the SunRice and Real Foods flavoured products had substantial similarities in the critical cues necessary to grab the attention of the ordinary reasonable consumer;
 &#8226; Ms Anderson said that a new product in a crowded category, that is one in which there were many products, had to jump out and attract the consumer to a point of difference. The way in which that was done was to use familiar brands, colouring, packaging, flavours and claims for products so that the product will "work hard", as packaged, to gain the attention of the ordinary reasonable shopper. Consumers rarely go into supermarkets looking for a new product. Generally they scan the shelves in the rice cake and corn cake category from a slight distance and are attracted quickly by the cues before making the decision to take the product;
 &#8226; Real Foods were using symbols or logos which were likely, despite differences of detail, to lead the ordinary reasonable consumer to form the impression of a common business or at least of an association, connection or affiliation. Ricegrowers relied on what Burchett J had said in Kettle Chip 46 FCR at 176, and argued that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Real Foods used a packaging type (flow pack) that it had never previously deployed in that form. Its packaging was virtually indistinguishable from the SunRice packaging. The ordinary reasonable consumer would not notice differences in the plastic flow pack of the SunRice rice cakes compared to the foil flow pack of the Real Foods and SunRice corn cakes;
 (b) the colours and imagery used for the packaging as well as the three flavour types of the two competitors were virtually identical;
 (c) the logo of Real Foods' brand was diminutive on the packaging contrary to the recommendations made to Real Foods by its market research company, The Leading Edge;
 (d) there was minimal, if any advertising;
 (e) Real Foods used the "Corn Thins" name as a brand despite many consumers seeing it as simply descriptive of a category of goods and not identifying it as a brand.

80 Ricegrowers argued that Real Foods adopted the course set out above in order to take a fast and easy option which copied the market leader, SunRice, and sought to emulate its success. Ricegrowers argued that Real Foods had chosen the packaging designs for its new flavoured products which sailed "too close to the wind" to that of SunRice. In effect, it claimed that Real Foods had designed a product knowing it had features of SunRice's products and which were calculated or likely to cause consumers, who would spend little time examining the differences in the products, to purchase them.</text>

<tocase>Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 170 ; (2007) 242 ALR 586 at 597</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/170.html</AustLII>
<text>76 It is appropriate for the court to approach the question of whether s 52 has been contravened by answering the composite question whether the defendant's conduct was misleading or deceptive in relation to the ordinary and reasonable consumer of rice cakes or corn cakes purchasing them in supermarkets: see Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 170 ; (2007) 242 ALR 586 at 597 [51] per French, Tamberlin JJ and myself.

77 The Court must be cautious against finding fraud merely because there has been an imitation of another's goods, get-up, method or trading or trading style: Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 861 [33] per Lord Scarman. In that case the trial judge had found that the defendant's deliberate purpose was to take advantage of the plaintiff's efforts to develop its product. The plaintiff had launched its product with mass media advertising at great expense prior to the defendant's product being put on the market. He found that the intention was not to pass off the defendant's goods as those of the plaintiff, but to take advantage of the market developed by the advertising campaign which the plaintiff had initiated. The Privy Council upheld findings that there had been no deception because the goods had been sufficiently distinguished. The plaintiff had needed to show that in doing so the defendant infringed the plaintiff's intangible property rights in the goodwill attaching to its product: Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 861 [35]. Their Lordships upheld the trial judge's finding that although the two cans in which the rival traders marketed their soft drink were of the same size (a stock size and shape in the trade) and similar colour, the defendant had sufficiently distinguished its product. The judge found it could readily be seen that they were different: Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 862-863 [42].

78 Ricegrowers argued that the collection in its packaging of obvious features in an attractive way not thought of before should be seen as a new idea which created a valuable resource to the person who conceived it, just as might be the case with an original invention for which a patent was claimed. It asserted that, in effect, Real Foods had produced such similar packaging for its three new flavoured corn thins that their get-up would convey the pleaded representations to an ordinary reasonable consumer and thus pass off Real Foods' goods as Ricegrowers'.</text>

<text>69 However, their Honours concluded that in the end it was still a question of fact for the court to determine whether, indeed, there had been established a reasonable probability of deception or confusion from the use, in that case, of a trademark or device. They held that the main issue in the case was a question which was never susceptible of much discussion. They said ( Australian Woollen Mills 58 CLR at 659; see too Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 220 per O'Connor J; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 30 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at 389 [121] per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, Branson J agreeing; Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window &amp; General Cleaners Ltd (1946) 63 RPC 39 at 40 per Lord Simonds, with whom Lords Wright, Porter and Goddard agreed):
 It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs.

72 In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 159 FCR 397 at 418-419 [96] - [99] Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ observed that the principles relating to passing off do not necessarily require a plaintiff to establish an exclusive reputation in relation to the use of a particular colour, in that case, purple. They said that the question was whether the plaintiff could establish facts that demonstrate that a particular use by the defendant of the colour was likely to mislead or deceive consumers into believing that there was relevant connection between the defendant and the plaintiff or their respective products: Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418 [96]; see too Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 42 per Lord Simonds. They observed that both in the context of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act and the common law tort of passing off, trade indicia other than names and logos can become associated with a particular trader, so that use by another trader could give rise to misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off. They said ( Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418 [97]):
 If particular branding elements used by a trader have been identified in a special way with that trader in the minds of the members of the public, there may be misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of the appropriation of those particular branding elements by another trader.

106 Ricegrowers has not demonstrated that Real Foods' use of its packaging was calculated or likely to lead the ordinary reasonable consumer to believe that any of the three corn thin flavoured corn cakes were made by or in some way associated with Ricegrowers or its SunRice products (the sour cream and chives, or sea salt and balsamic vinegar thin flavoured rice cakes or the nacho cheese flavoured corn cake): Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418-419 [96]-[99]; Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 42. The ordinary reasonable consumer would not believe that, to the extent that the packaging of the flavoured Real Foods products was similar, any of those packages emanated from or were in any way associated with Ricegrowers or SunRice: Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 [109]-[110]; Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [22]; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 506F-G; Payton 17 RPC at 51; see too Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 9) [2008] FCA 470 at [88] per Heerey J.

<tocase>Payton &amp; Co Ltd v Snelling Lampard &amp; Co Ltd (1899) 17 RPC 48</tocase>
<text>61 O'Connor J found that the question for determination was whether the defendant had made the difference of manufacture and ownership clear on the face of the package when adopting cartons of the same material, colour, shape and size of the plaintiff's packaging. He applied what Lindley MR said in Payton &amp; Co Ltd v Snelling Lampard &amp; Co Ltd (1899) 17 RPC 48 at 52. Lindley MR discussed the situation where goods themselves resembled one another, in that case coffee, and were packaged similarly. He said that the issue was not that the defendant's goods or get-up was like the plaintiff's by reason of the features common to them and others. Rather, in a passage cited with approval by O'Connor J in Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 217, in order to succeed in a passing off action, the plaintiff:
 ...must make out that the defendant's are like his by reason of something peculiar to him, and by reason of the defendant having adopted some mark, or device, or label, or something of that kind, which distinguishes the plaintiff's from other goods which have, like his, the features common to the trade. Unless the plaintiff can bring his case up to that, he fails.

63 Thus, the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff: Burford &amp; Sons [1909] HCA 83 ; 8 CLR 212 ; Payton 17 RPC at 56; affirmed [1901] AC 308 ; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 507H-508B per Lord Oliver.

<text>63 Thus, the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff: Burford &amp; Sons [1909] HCA 83 ; 8 CLR 212 ; Payton 17 RPC at 56; affirmed [1901] AC 308 ; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 507H-508B per Lord Oliver. Lord Oliver said that it was important in such a case for the defendant to see that the goods could really be distinguished from those of or associated with the plaintiff. But, he said the question was how far the defendants' trademark bears such a resemblance to that of the plaintiff, as to be calculated to deceive incautious purchasers: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509B citing Lord Kingsdown in Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Cloth Co Ltd [1865] EngR 199 ; (1865) 11 H L Cas 523 at 539.

70 In Payton [1901] AC at 311 Lord Macnaghten said that the evidence of witnesses as to whether a customer would be likely to be deceived was, not a matter for the witnesses, but for the judge. He said, in a passage approved by Dixon CJ, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ in Scott v Numurkah Corporation [1954] HCA 14 ; (1954) 91 CLR 300 at 313:
 The judge, looking at the exhibits before him and also paying due attention to the evidence adduced, must not surrender his own independent judgment to any witness.</text>

<tocase>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] 1 WLR 491</tocase>
<text>62 Much later the House of Lords held that a plaintiff who sold lemon juice in a container resembling a natural lemon with a green triangular label bearing the word "Jif" was entitled in an action for passing off to protect the get-up and packaging of the lemon shape because over the years a secondary meaning had been created associating the plaintiff's get-up with goods manufactured by it: Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] 1 WLR 491 at 506F-G per Lord Oliver of Aylmerton who said:
 Here the mere fact that he has previously been the only trader dealing in goods of that type and so described may lead members of the public to believe that all such goods must emanate from him simply because they know of no other. To succeed in such a case he must demonstrate more than simply the sole use of the descriptive term. He must demonstrate that it has become so closely associated with his goods as to acquire the secondary meaning not simply of goods of that description but specifically of goods of which he and he alone is the source.

63 Thus, the mere fact that a defendant makes some distinction on the packaging from similar packaging used by or copied from the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to distinguish the goods from those of or associated with the plaintiff: Burford &amp; Sons [1909] HCA 83 ; 8 CLR 212 ; Payton 17 RPC at 56; affirmed [1901] AC 308 ; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 507H-508B per Lord Oliver. Lord Oliver said that it was important in such a case for the defendant to see that the goods could really be distinguished from those of or associated with the plaintiff. But, he said the question was how far the defendants' trademark bears such a resemblance to that of the plaintiff, as to be calculated to deceive incautious purchasers: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509B citing Lord Kingsdown in Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Cloth Co Ltd [1865] EngR 199 ; (1865) 11 H L Cas 523 at 539.

64 In Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 514H-515C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders. Thus, the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his. He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public, but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design. He referred to JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765 at 771 per Cozens-Hardy MR and at 774 per Farwell LJ. In that case, at 773, Fletcher Moulton LJ had said there that the get-up of an article meant a capricious addition to the article itself, such as the colour or shape or wrapper or anything of that kind: see too Doctor Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 281 at 369 [339] per Goldberg J; and Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 515C-D per Lord Jauncey.

66 So, in a claim alleging that a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act has occurred, the court considers the effect on an ordinary reasonable shopper by conduct involving the making of a representation to the class of retail consumers shopping in a supermarket displaying a trader's packaged goods on its shelves: Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [101]-[103]. The court attributes particular characteristics to this shopper. In actions for passing off a similar test applies in assessing whether a representation was made and, if so, what its effect was. So, in Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D Lord Oliver said that this is done against the background of the type of market in which the goods are sold, the manner in which they are sold, and the habits and characteristics of purchasers in that market: see too Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [100].

81 The parties agreed that the ordinary reasonable consumer ( Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [101]-[103]: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D) was described accurately in the packaging brief prepared by Ms Anderson as having the following demographic makeup, namely: the ordinary reasonable consumer of the parties' rice and corn cake products was a female aged between 30 and 49 years. Most would have middle or older families (i.e. school age children or teenagers) but some would not have children; some would be in households with either one or two income earners. She would be working either full-time or part-time, be married and educated. The ordinary reasonable consumer would be purchasing these products as snack foods for herself and her entire family unit. She would be health conscious and would want to set a good example for her family by her healthy eating. She also would be conscious of her weight and would feel guilty when snacking. She would not want to have foods that were full of fat or sugar. Nor would she want to give her children or teenagers such foods or set a bad example for them.

85 The ordinary reasonable consumer was used to seeing the two distinct families of goods presented on the supermarket shelves in this way: Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 509C-D; Campomar 202 CLR at 84-85 [100]-[103].

106 Ricegrowers has not demonstrated that Real Foods' use of its packaging was calculated or likely to lead the ordinary reasonable consumer to believe that any of the three corn thin flavoured corn cakes were made by or in some way associated with Ricegrowers or its SunRice products (the sour cream and chives, or sea salt and balsamic vinegar thin flavoured rice cakes or the nacho cheese flavoured corn cake): Darrell Lea 159 FCR at 418-419 [96]-[99]; Office Cleaning 63 RPC at 42. The ordinary reasonable consumer would not believe that, to the extent that the packaging of the flavoured Real Foods products was similar, any of those packages emanated from or were in any way associated with Ricegrowers or SunRice: Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 [109]-[110]; Cadbury Schweppes [1980] 2 NSWLR at 858 [22]; Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 506F-G; Payton 17 RPC at 51; see too Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 9) [2008] FCA 470 at [88] per Heerey J.</text>

<text>69 However, their Honours concluded that in the end it was still a question of fact for the court to determine whether, indeed, there had been established a reasonable probability of deception or confusion from the use, in that case, of a trademark or device. They held that the main issue in the case was a question which was never susceptible of much discussion. They said ( Australian Woollen Mills 58 CLR at 659; see too Burford &amp; Sons 8 CLR at 220 per O'Connor J; Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 30 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at 389 [121] per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ, Branson J agreeing; Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window &amp; General Cleaners Ltd (1946) 63 RPC 39 at 40 per Lord Simonds, with whom Lords Wright, Porter and Goddard agreed):
 It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs.</text>

<tocase>Taco Co of Australian Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177</tocase>
<text>52 In these proceedings SunRice seeks only equitable relief in respect of the claim for passing off; it has abandoned any claim for damages and seeks only an account and injunctive relief. Thus, the proceedings for passing off seek a remedy to protect against injury to the goodwill built up by the activities of SunRice: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 88 [108] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. And, as their Honours pointed out, the action based on a contravention of s 52 is designed to protect consumers. Whether or not conduct amounts to a representation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what was said, written, and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances: see Campomar 202 CLR at 84 [100], citing Taco Co of Australian Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202 per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ.</text>

<tocase>Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361</tocase>
<text>57 Lord Parker identified the basis of a passing off action as a false representation by the defendant that his goods were the plaintiff's. In Campomar 202 CLR at 88-89 at [109]-[110] the High Court recognised that the range of the defendant's conduct which could constitute passing off included inducing consumers to believe that the defendant's goods or services had an association, quality or endorsement which belonged, or would belong, to the goods or services of or associated with the plaintiff. As Lord Parker recognised, relevantly here, the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the get-up in question, impliedly represents the defendant's goods to be goods of the plaintiff or associated with the plaintiff, whether generally or in respect of a particular class or quality. In other words, the question is whether the defendant's use of the get-up is calculated to deceive. He pointed out that it would be impossible to enumerate or classify all the possible ways in which a man may make the false representation relied on: Spalding 84 LJ Ch at 450; see too Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361 at 369-370 per Beaumont, Branson and Lindgren JJ; ConAgra 33 FCR at 356 per Gummow J.</text>
