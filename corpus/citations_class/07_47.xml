<tocase>Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 229 ALR 445</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/47.html</AustLII>
<text>46 Mr Lang's notice of injury and compensation claim adequately disclose the nature of his claimed injury though they may be sparse on the circumstances giving rise to that injury. It is not necessary for me to speculate as to the reason for this as it is not directly relevant to the issue that I must decide. In Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 229 ALR 445 the High Court considered the concept of 'injury' under the SRC Act and said, at [10]:
 
 'First, the Act does not oblige Comcare to pay compensation in respect of an employee's impairment; it is liable to pay compensation in respect of "the injury". Secondly, the term "injury" is not used in the Act in the sense of "workplace accident". The definition of injury is expressed in terms of the resultant effect of an incident or ailment upon the employee's body. Thirdly, the term "injury" is not used in a global sense to describe the general condition of the employee following an incident.'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/209.html</AustLII>
<text>26 Counsel for Mr Lang referred to Comcare v Nichols (1999) FCA 209 in which Heerey J applied Phillips v The Commonwealth of Australia [1964] HCA 22 ; (1964) 110 CLR 347 in the context of the SRC Act . In the latter case the High Court held, at 350:
 
 '... the application of the same principles may well mean that in some cases the onus of proving critical facts may rest upon the Commonwealth . Such a case would be where the Commissioner has purported to terminate an employee's right to compensation under an antecedently existing determination by reason of a material change of circumstances.'</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth of Australia v Borg [1991] FCA 710 ; (1994) 20 AAR 299</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1991/710.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Counsel for Mr Lang submitted that although the Tribunal identified the correct test for determining whether existing benefits may be cancelled, it failed to apply this test. The Tribunal referred to the decision in Commonwealth of Australia v Borg [1991] FCA 710 ; (1994) 20 AAR 299 at 370, where Jenkinson J said that a decision to cancel compensation should not be made unless the decision maker "was persuaded that one of the entitling circumstances had on or before" the date of the decision "ceased to exist". According to Mr Lang, however, the Tribunal failed to do this.

28 Despite this, however, it does not appear that in substance the Tribunal adopted a lesser standard than that mentioned in Borg . The Tribunal expressly accepted Dr Griffith's evidence that "in the absence of structural injury (of which there is no evidence) it is reasonable to expect that the aggravation would have resolved long before 29 November 2004." This finding, in conjunction with the reports of Dr Andrews and Dr Kitchin clearly formed the basis for the Tribunal's decision, rather than any paucity of evidence adduced by Mr Lang. Whilst the Tribunal ostensibly applied a 'balance of probabilities' standard, in light of the principle in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272, its finding in substance was that Comcare had discharged its evidentiary onus.</text>

<tocase>Frosch v Comcare [2004] FCA 1642</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1642.html</AustLII>
<text>45 In support of its submission that 'the injury must be the injury as identified by the notice and claim', Comcare relied on Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford [2006] FCAFC 87 and Frosch v Comcare [2004] FCA 1642. In Frosch at [8] , Whitlam J commented, with respect to similar requirements in s 53 of the SRC Act: 'the essential information to be imparted under s 53 will be the nature of an injury or ailment and its connection with the employment.' I do not take issue with these comments but in my view they do not support Comcare's case.

47 Mr Lang notified Comcare as to his injury and broadly outlined his view as to how this injury occurred; see [4]-[5] above. Although his description was somewhat incoherent in my view, it is sufficient to meet the test outlined in Frosch. Mr Lang's notice indicated the nature of his injury and its connection to his employment, and is consistent with the concept of injury to which the High Court referred.

48 Comcare's determination in 1984 that accepted liability for Mr Lang's injury made no mention of the circumstances in which the injury was incurred, save to say that it was in the course of Mr Lang's employment. Comcare described the injury as 'aggravation of a pre-existing condition of pain in mid thoracic region'. This is the same condition/symptom discussed in Dr Talbot's report. Comcare's liability was not restricted to a 'nature and conditions' claim made by Mr Lang.

49 Counsel for Comcare argued that the mere fact that Mr Lang's fall in 1981 coincided with the date of his claim does not mean that Mr Lang's compensable injury included injuries sustained in the fall. This, of course, is correct, however Mr Lang claims (with some support from the expert medical evidence) that this fall contributed to the injury that was notified and accepted as a compensable injury and that this injury is a continuing cause of incapacity.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>53 Mr Lang's final ground of appeal concerned the Tribunal's failure to give its reasons in respect of several material facts, including (and this was the focus of Mr Lang's submissions) the failure to give reasons for its rejection of Dr Talbot's report as relevant evidence. The Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it, or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight. It is under no obligation to refer to all of the evidence before it, particularly where, as here, neither party made submissions on it. It would have been open for the Tribunal to reject Dr Talbot's evidence or simply to prefer the evidence of Dr Griffiths. The Tribunal is, however, obliged by s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) to include in its reasons findings on all material questions of fact. As noted in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331 per Gleeson CJ and at 345-6 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, with respect to a similar requirement found in s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), this is not an obligation to make a finding on every question of fact that is regarded as objectively material by a court conducting judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.

54 Even if the Tribunal excluded consideration of the 1981 fall at the directions hearing it still had an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that was plainly central to Mr Lang's claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim. Mr Lang was entitled to seek review of that decision.</text>

<tocase>Telepacific Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85</tocase>
<text>55 If Comcare's submission about the directions hearing is incorrect, then plainly the Tribunal was required to indicate why it was that it preferred Dr Griffith's evidence. Given that the Tribunal had before it two medical reports that came to diametrically opposed conclusions it was obliged to explain why it either excluded one from its consideration or, if it considered both reports, why it preferred that of Dr Griffith. Its failure do so makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal's reasoning processes, and is itself an error of law; Telepacific Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85 at [54].

56 For this reason Mr Lang's application must be allowed and the matter referred to the Tribunal for reconsideration according to law.

<tocase>Ward v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] FCA 7</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/7.html</AustLII>
<text>10 Mr Lang's initial claim was determined in accordance with the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth) (the 1971 Act). That Act has been superseded by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (SRC Act) which commenced on 24 June 1988 and which governs the present application. Section 124 of the SRC Act provides that a person is only entitled to compensation under the Act for an injury sustained prior to its commencement if the person would have been entitled to compensation under the relevant preceding Act, in this case the 1971 Act.

11 The Tribunal provided a short summary of Mr Lang's medical history. It found that Mr Lang suffered from conditions which caused pain in the thoracic region of his spine prior to his alleged fall in 1981. The clinical notes of Mr Lang's general practitioners in the relevant period, Dr Reeve and Dr Herath, supported this finding.

12 The Tribunal also referred to a report of Dr Andrews, Consultant Neurologist, in August 1982 which indicated that any aggravation of Mr Lang's condition due to his work for the Commonwealth would have only lasted a short period of time (a few months) and to a report of Dr Kitchin that Mr Lang's complaint, in March 1983, was of thoracic degenerative disease.

43 Section 54 of the 1971 Act provides that no compensation is payable under the Act unless a claim in writing for the compensation was served, as prescribed, on the Commissioner within the relevant time. This provision is a procedural pre-requisite to an entitlement to compensation under the Act: see Ward v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] FCA 7 at [25] in relation to a similar provision under the 1930 Act.

44 Comcare submitted that the 1981 fall had not been notified or claimed by Mr Lang and accordingly that liability for that injury had not been accepted by Comcare in 1984. Accordingly, the fall could not have been the subject of Comcare's determination in 2004 and therefore could not be relevant to the Tribunal's review. I accept that the Tribunal's enquiry was limited to a consideration of whether Mr Lang was, as at the date of the Tribunal's decision, entitled to compensation for the injury as claimed however it does not follow from this that any damage to Mr Lang's back that may have been caused by the 1981 fall was necessarily outside of this enquiry.</text>
