<text>The extent of the authority conferred &#8212; and the conclusion that those executing a warrant do not have an " unexaminable discretion " &#8212; was endorsed by Hely J in Adler v Gardiner [2002] FCA 1141 , 43 ACSR 42 at 33 to 34 as follows (citation omitted): 
 
 The objective inquiry 
 

 
 
 [39] The executing officer or constable assisting, has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that things seized will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence. The notion of reasonable grounds for a suspicion imports an objective test, but "reasonable" involves a value or normative judgment ( Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 at 167), and there may well be legitimate differences of opinion as to what falls within the term, particularly when it is used in relation to a nebulous expression such as "suspicion". A court is not entitled to substitute its own opinion on that question for the opinion of the executing officer or constable assisting. That does not mean that the executing officer, or constable assisting, has an unexaminable discretion; it does mean, however, that the officer's decision is only impeachable if the decision was one which the officer could not lawfully reach on the materials before him or her ...
 ... 
 

 
 
 [41] The onus, then, is on the applicants to establish that the seizure decisions taken in relation to the disputed documents were infected by reviewable error. ...

Notwithstanding the conclusion that it is unnecessary to resolve the Applicants' submission as to the warrants being " bad on their face ", considerable concern is nevertheless expressed as to the guidance which warrants of such complexity provide to those executing them and in protecting those whose premises are being searched.

It was perhaps in recognition of the complexity presented by the warrants that a briefing session was held prior to 15 April 2009 with a view to better informing those persons who would be involved in the events of the following day in executing the warrants issued.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151</tocase>
<text>At one time it had been suggested that a " warrant should state the description of the offence in question with a particularity sufficient to enable the person whose premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search ": Parker v Churchill [1986] FCA 88 ; (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 348 per Jackson J; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151 at 153 per Lockhart J. But there has since been a retreat from such an exacting standard. The " precision required ", it has since been suggested, " may vary with the nature of the offence, the other circumstances revealed, the particularity achieved in other respects, and what is disclosed by the warrant, read as a whole, and taking account of its recitals ": Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [1991] FCA 92 ; (1991) 31 FCR 523 at 543 per Burchett J. The objective of the requirement, however, has remained constant. The " requirement to state the offence exists to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant would involve . ... What is significant ... is that the warrant disclose the nature of the offence in question so as to indicate the area of search ": Harts Australia No 1 (1997) 75 FCR at 152 per Hill, Cooper and Whitlam JJ.

Each of the limitations upon the power conferred by these provisions only assumes additional importance when it is recalled that a search warrant may be issued and executed in respect to premises occupied by persons other than those involved or suspected of being involved in criminal activity. Where the terms of s 3E are satisfied, a warrant may thus be issued in respect to premises occupied by persons unconnected with any crime. The fundamental interference with privacy which is authorised by a search warrant must be constantly borne in mind. Search warrants are " ... intrusions into the sanctity of a person's domain and concomitantly an interference with his privacy ... ": Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686 at [106] per Graham J (applying: Cloran (1984) 4 FCR at 154 per Lockhart J). Similarly, in TVW Ltd v Robinson [1964] WAR 33 at 37 Negus J observed: 
 
 The issue of a search warrant is a very serious matter indeed because it authorizes the invasion of the privacy of the subject in his home or in his business premises. It necessarily involves an interference with the rights of an individual and affects his liberty.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/667.html</AustLII>
<text>To the extent that there may have been some unstated assumption on the part of the Applicants at the outset that s 16 may have conferred some unconstrained power or authority on this Court to grant interlocutory relief, such an assumption must be rejected. In Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 at 434 Brennan J observed (citations omitted): 
 
 The relief which may be ordered under s 16(1)(d) of the AD(JR) Act is not so much at large that the Court may make an order against a party to litigation even though no ground for relief under the general law is established against that party. Section 16(1)(d) does not set the Court on an uncharted course without legal reference points by which to steer. ... 
 

 
 
 However, s 16(1)(d) applies only when the making of an order is "necessary to do justice between the parties". That means justice according to law. It may be that a person who acquires information knowing that the information is imparted to him in breach of a statutory duty is in the same position as he would have been if the duty were an equitable obligation of confidence. ... 
 

 
 
 If there be no right to relief against a person under the general law, that person does not become liable to have an adverse order made under s 16(1)(d) merely by reason of being joined as a respondent in an application to the Federal Court under the AD(JR) Act. ...

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/247.html</AustLII>
<text>For present purposes, however, it is sufficient to consider the terms of s 3E and the terms of the warrants issued thereunder. When considering the ambit of a power to search and seize under a statutory warrant, it is to be recalled that the extent of that power " is that conferred by the statute, no more and no less ": Challenge Plastics Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1993] FCA 247 ; (1993) 42 FCR 397 at 408 to 409. Each of the requirements imposed by s 3E(5) and the other provisions in Pt 1AA , it is considered, must be construed according to the terms used and in a context where the purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Hart [2002] FCAFC 392 at [65] , 124 FCR at 399 to 400 per French, Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ.</text>

<tocase>Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones [1968] 2 QB 299</tocase>
<text>For the purposes of the present interlocutory application, it is unnecessary to do more than refer to the breadth of the authority conferred by s 3F and to the constraints imposed upon that authority. The authority conferred is that conferred upon the " executing officer or a constable assisting ". It is not an authority to seize only that which a Court subsequently concludes falls within the terms of the warrant. But the extent of the authority conferred by s 3F is constrained by the requirement that the " executing officer " or " constable assisting " only seize that which he " believes on reasonable grounds " is relevantly either " evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates "; or " evidential material in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence " 
In the absence of the " executing officer " or " constable " forming such a belief on " reasonable grounds ", the warrant confers no authority to seize anything. No authority has been conferred by the legislature or by the warrants to enter a person's premises and to seize at random documents or things which may be believed to be of interest. There must always remain " reasonable grounds " for the belief set forth in s 3F(1)(d). Authority to seize things other than those described in the warrant (cf Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones [1968] 2 QB 299 at 313) is now expressly addressed in s 3F(1)(d)(ii). But that authority also remains confined by the requirement that there be " reasonable grounds " for the belief that is formed and by the requirement that the thing seized be " in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence ".</text>

<tocase>Coward v Allen [1984] FCA 53 ; (1984) 52 ALR 320</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/53.html</AustLII>
<text>First, Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondents quite properly relied upon the public interest in permitting those responsible for enforcement of the criminal law to continue their investigations. This consideration was rightly advanced as of relevance to both the discretion to grant interlocutory relief and to the discretion to grant an extension of time pursuant to s 11(1)(c) of the Judicial Review Act . In Coward v Allen [1984] FCA 53 ; (1984) 52 ALR 320 Northrop J had concluded in respect to a warrant issued under the now-repealed s 10 of the Crimes Act that there was a serious question to be tried in relation " to the manner in which the warrants were executed and whether the seizure of things was valid ": (1984) 52 ALR at 336. His Honour nevertheless declined relief. In doing so His Honour concluded: 
 
 In my opinion, the motions for interlocutory injunctions should be refused. The balance of convenience weighs in favour of the respondents. In the public interest, they should have a reasonable time to examine the things seized, to decide whether to prosecute or not, and to retain the things needed as evidence in support of any prosecutions. The other things should be returned to the applicants. The court hearing those criminal proceedings may have to determine, on the principles expressed in Bunning v Cross , whether evidence obtained by means of the search warrants is admissible or not. Any civil action arising from the seizure could be continued at the conclusion of those criminal proceedings. If no prosecutions are commenced, the applicants would be free to continue with their actions based on the unlawful execution of the warrants. In the meantime, the public interest requires that the respondents to the actions should be able to continue their investigations. Accordingly, the motions for interlocutory injunctions are refused. 
 

 
 A valuable safeguard which adequately protected the interests of those whose property was wrongly seized lay, it was said, in the discretion of the Court &#8212; should there be a prosecution &#8212; to exclude such evidence. In the context of considering whether documents should be returned, in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 405, Hill J likewise observed:
 
 
 I am thus placed in the situation where there are competing views, although it must be said that the preponderance of view is in favour of refusing to order the return of items, even where those items have been illegally seized, if there are criminal proceedings pending in which the items may be used as evidence. While the court would not wish to be seen to be rewarding members of the police who obtain possession of material without lawful authority, there is to be weighed against that a public interest in the administration of and non-interference with justice. Should the court order that material, albeit invalidly obtained, to be used in evidence in a pending prosecution be delivered up to those from whom it was taken the prosecution, which might otherwise succeed, could be frustrated. 
 

 
 
 Of course, the question whether the items in the present case, if otherwise admissible, should be admitted in evidence in the pending prosecution, despite the fact that they were obtained without lawful authority, will be a matter for the judicial officer hearing the prosecution: Bunning v Cross [1978] HCA 22 ; (1978) 141 CLR 54 ; 19 ALR 641. The existence of this discretion suggests to me that I should not interfere with the pending prosecution by requiring the documents seized to be returned but leave instead to the judicial officer presiding on that prosecution the question whether the material illegally obtained should be admitted into evidence in the prosecution.

The importance of the enforcement of the criminal law may readily be accepted. It is self-evidently in the public interest that those who commit criminal offences should be brought to account. Those who commit fraud, including a fraud upon the public revenue, should be brought to account. It is equally of importance that those investigating suspected criminal conduct be able to exercise all powers as are conferred upon them by the legislature to access materials and to secure the availability of all materials lawfully seized for the purposes of any subsequent proceeding. But it is not considered that either Northrop J or Hill J was attempting to do anything other than to recognise that aspect of the public interest and apply it to the facts before them.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1981/31.html</AustLII>
<text>When addressing the terms of the now-repealed s 10 in Crowley v Murphy [1981] FCA 31 ; (1981) 34 ALR 496 , Lockhart J addressed some of the principles relevant to the manner in which a search warrant is executed as follows: 
 
 I will not attempt to state exhaustively the procedures that policemen should follow when executing search warrants. That would be both unnecessary and undesirable. What should be done must vary according to the circumstances of each case. But I shall endeavour to give some general guidance. 
 

 
 
 First, like most statutory powers, the power of enforcing a search warrant must be exercised in good faith. 
 

 
 
 Second, the power must be exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred. It must not be used for some ulterior purpose. If, for example, it is used to punish the person whose premises are to be entered and searched, plainly that is an ulterior purpose. 
 

 
 
 Third, the power must be exercised fairly, having regard to all the circumstances. 
 

 
 
 Fourth, it must be exercised having regard to those affected by its exercise and, in particular, to the rights of those persons. I shall return to this later. 
 

 
 
 Fifth, the officer executing the warrant must strictly follow the directions contained in it and must not exceed the limits of the authority it confers. 
 
 
 
Northrop J agreed: (1981) 34 ALR at 505.

The same principles, it is considered, are equally applicable to a warrant issued under s 3E and executed under s 3F.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/392.html</AustLII>
<text>Both sections are contained within Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act . That Part was incorporated into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). Those amendments (in turn) had their origins in an interim report now known as the Gibbs Report (Attorney-General's Department, Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, Fourth Interim Report: Offences Relating to the Administration of Justice, Offences Against the Government Involving Property or Money, Bribery and Corruption and Search Warrants (Attorney-General's Department, Canberra, 1990)). " That report and the pre-existing law form an essential part of the context relevant to the interpretation of Pt 1AA ": Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 (' Harts Australia No 1 ') at 148 per Hill, Cooper and Whitlam JJ; Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 (' Hart ') at [17] [2002] FCAFC 392 ; , 124 FCR 384 at 390 per French, Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ.

For present purposes, however, it is sufficient to consider the terms of s 3E and the terms of the warrants issued thereunder. When considering the ambit of a power to search and seize under a statutory warrant, it is to be recalled that the extent of that power " is that conferred by the statute, no more and no less ": Challenge Plastics Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1993] FCA 247 ; (1993) 42 FCR 397 at 408 to 409. Each of the requirements imposed by s 3E(5) and the other provisions in Pt 1AA , it is considered, must be construed according to the terms used and in a context where the purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Hart [2002] FCAFC 392 at [65] , 124 FCR at 399 to 400 per French, Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ.

Notwithstanding s 3K, the power to seize still derives primarily from s 3F and the language of s 3K is " quite specific ": Hart [2002] FCAFC 392 at [92] , 124 FCR at 407. French, Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ, in the context of addressing a different issue to that now before the Court, nevertheless there observed: 
 
 [86] Where s 3K is relied upon, seizure is deferred until the completion of the examination of things moved from the warrant premises under that section. ... [T]he section involves a distinction between moving things from the warrant premises to another place for examination, on the one hand, and seizure of those things, on the other. Section 3K does not specify any time period for the completion of the examination. However, it is ancillary to s 3F. It confers no free standing power of seizure. The purpose of the examination or processing which it authorises under s 3K(2) is to determine whether the things which have been moved from the premises "may be seized under the warrant". The power to seize still derives from s 3F. It therefore exists only in relation to a "warrant that is in force". The warrant remains in force only for the period specified in it (s 3E(5)). If seizure has not been made of things moved under s 3K within the period stated in the warrant, then the power to seize lapses. If examination has not been completed the power to examine also lapses. Absent any other lawful basis for retaining the things moved, they must be returned.
 ... 
 

 
 
 [92] The respondents contended that s 3K(2) authorises not only the removal to another place of computers or storage devices in or on which electronic material is stored, but the copying of such material onto storage devices brought to the premises for the purpose and the removal from the premises of those devices. It is a fundamental difficulty in the path of this approach to the construction of s 3K(2) that the language of the subsection is quite specific. It provides that, in certain circumstances, "the things may be moved to another place". The provision only authorises the moving of a thing to another place for the purpose described. The fact that the legislation, by virtue of the definition of "evidential material", contemplates that material in electronic form, may be "seized" (without identifying the manner by which it may be seized) does not demonstrate that material in electronic form can be "moved" in accordance with s 3K(2) of the Crimes Act . 
 

 
Their Honours there also referred to the " need to recognise the operational realities in which warrants are executed ": [2002] FCAFC 392 at [68] , 124 FCR at 401.

One purpose achieved by provisions such as ss 3H and 3P is to ensure that the occupier or other person is fully informed as to the extent of the authority conferred by a warrant. He is thereby placed in a position whereby he can observe that the terms of a warrant are not being exceeded. The statement in the warrant of those matters required by s 3E(5)(a) and (c), and the requirement that a copy of the warrant be made available, ensure that the occupier or other person is not reduced to a mere bystander. Just as the issue of a warrant may be challenged in an appropriate Court upon the basis (for example) that the issuing officer erred when reaching the state of " satisfaction " required by s 3E(1) , the manner in which a warrant is executed may also be challenged upon the basis (for example) that there did not exist " reasonable grounds " for seizing materials as required by s 3F(1)(d).

Section 3L imposes its own further constraints upon the power that may be exercised, including the limitations in s 3L(3) , the requirement for notice in s 3L(5) and the limitation as to the period of time that " equipment " may be " secured " in s 3L(6).</text>

<text>Section 11(1)(c) assumes present relevance because the events now the subject of the present proceeding took place on 15 April 2009 and the initial Application was not lodged until 7 September 2009 &#8212; a period some four months out of time. Reliance upon s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') may not present such a problem for the Applicants &#8212; but reliance upon s 39B could not permit review of the decision of the " issuing officer " to issue the warrants, that officer not being an " an officer ... of the Commonwealth ". If an extension of time were granted, the decisions to issue the warrants would also be susceptible to review pursuant to the Judicial Review Act . Decisions to issue warrants, it may be accepted, are decisions of an " administrative character " ( Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 175 at [26] , 65 ALD 463 at 470 per Drummond J) and decisions made " under an enactment " ( Kennedy [2004] FCA 562 at [7] , 135 FCR at 524 per Branson J).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/176.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 11(1) provides as follows: 
 
 (1) An application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for an order of review: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ...; and 
 (b) ...; and 
 (c) shall be lodged with a Registry of the court concerned and, in the case of an application in relation to a decision that has been made and the terms of which were recorded in writing and set out in a document that was furnished to the applicant, including such a decision that a person purported to make after the expiration of the period within which it was required to be made, shall be so lodged within the prescribed period or within such further time as the court concerned (whether before or after the expiration of the prescribed period) allows. 
 
 

 
The principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 11(1)(c) have been summarised by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348 to 349.

Included amongst those matters relevant to the exercise of the discretion are " the merits of the substantial application " and prejudice to the respondent, although it is recognised that " the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension ".

It is considered that the merits of the case as sought to be advanced by the Applicants are such that an extension of time should be granted. The discretion to extend time in the present proceeding has been exercised by reference to the merits of the case together with those other matters referred to by Wilcox J.

Two submissions advanced on behalf of the Respondents, however, warrant specific attention.</text>

<text>To the extent that there may have been some unstated assumption on the part of the Applicants at the outset that s 16 may have conferred some unconstrained power or authority on this Court to grant interlocutory relief, such an assumption must be rejected.

<tocase>Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 , 135 FCR 520</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/562.html</AustLII>
<text>A further concern in respect to the manner in which the warrant was being executed at the O'Keefe's Lane premises emerges from a separate Affidavit filed on behalf of the Applicants. The deponent to that Affidavit , Mr Edward Mazzoni, is the director of corporate services of an entity called Pakshun Enterprise Pty Ltd. Mr Mazzoni attended the O'Keefe's Lane premises and sets forth a statement made by Federal Agent Needham as follows: 
 
 "We will need to take all of the servers and some of the hard drives today because we are not able to image them here. We agree to provide your lawyers with copies of the images once they have been imaged and we will also return the computers to you at that time." 
 

 
Accepted literally, that is a statement acknowledging that the search which the warrant authorises to be conducted of the premises at O'Keefe's Lane is not to be undertaken there but at some other undisclosed place. Accepted literally, it is also the expression of an intent to " take all of the servers " irrespective of whether or not there has been any attempt at " operating " the equipment as required by s 3L(2) with a view to determining what may be found upon the " hard drives ". Again, at a final hearing that part of the conversation deposed to by Mr Mazzoni may be put in a broader context. And s 3L(1A) may not clothe the Respondents with sufficient authority to copy the data on the disks in the manner in which they did. Irrespective of whether " data " is to be construed in the manner as concluded by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 at [60] , 135 FCR 530 at 537 to 538, the issue which gives rise to the serious question to be tried remains a question as to whether the manner of execution of the warrants was such as to provide " reasonable grounds " for the belief referred to in s 3L(1A).

Nor is it considered that s 3K necessarily provides the authority to remove " the servers and some of the hard drives ". Such evidence as there presently is available provides little basis for any conclusion to be reached that it was " significantly more practicable " to move equipment for the purposes of s 3K(2)(a)(i). Forensic experts were assisting in the search. And, even if s 3K(2)(a)(i) was satisfied, there remains concern as to whether s 3K(2)(a)(ii) had been satisfied.

On either view, it is considered that at this stage a serious question arises in respect to whether the manner in which the warrant was executed on the O'Keefe's Lane premises in respect to the computers found on those premises has exceeded the authority conferred by the legislation and by the terms of the warrant as issued.

Section 11 of the Judicial Review Act provides for the manner in which an application under that Act is to be made and s 11(1)(c) imposes ( inter alia ) a requirement to lodge an Application in the Registry within 28 days of the decision the subject of review. It is ss 5, 6 and 7 of that Act that confer jurisdiction upon this Court pursuant to the terms of that Act. If the jurisdiction of this Court which is sought to be invoked is to include that conferred by the Judicial Review Act , it may be that the Amended Application fails to comply with O 4 r 3(1)(b) of the Federal Court Rules : cf Kennedy [2004] FCA 562 at [5] , 135 FCR at 523 per Branson J.

Whether any further amendment is sought to be made to the existing Amended Application , however, remains a matter for the Applicants to address and for the docket judge who has this proceeding assigned to him to resolve.

Section 11(1)(c) assumes present relevance because the events now the subject of the present proceeding took place on 15 April 2009 and the initial Application was not lodged until 7 September 2009 &#8212; a period some four months out of time. Reliance upon s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') may not present such a problem for the Applicants &#8212; but reliance upon s 39B could not permit review of the decision of the " issuing officer " to issue the warrants, that officer not being an " an officer ... of the Commonwealth ". If an extension of time were granted, the decisions to issue the warrants would also be susceptible to review pursuant to the Judicial Review Act . Decisions to issue warrants, it may be accepted, are decisions of an " administrative character " ( Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 175 at [26] , 65 ALD 463 at 470 per Drummond J) and decisions made " under an enactment " ( Kennedy [2004] FCA 562 at [7] , 135 FCR at 524 per Branson J).</text>

<text>Each of the limitations upon the power conferred by these provisions only assumes additional importance when it is recalled that a search warrant may be issued and executed in respect to premises occupied by persons other than those involved or suspected of being involved in criminal activity. Where the terms of s 3E are satisfied, a warrant may thus be issued in respect to premises occupied by persons unconnected with any crime. The fundamental interference with privacy which is authorised by a search warrant must be constantly borne in mind. Search warrants are " ... intrusions into the sanctity of a person's domain and concomitantly an interference with his privacy ... ": Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686 at [106] per Graham J (applying: Cloran (1984) 4 FCR at 154 per Lockhart J). Similarly, in TVW Ltd v Robinson [1964] WAR 33 at 37 Negus J observed: 
 
 The issue of a search warrant is a very serious matter indeed because it authorizes the invasion of the privacy of the subject in his home or in his business premises. It necessarily involves an interference with the rights of an individual and affects his liberty.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1986/88.html</AustLII>
<text>At one time it had been suggested that a " warrant should state the description of the offence in question with a particularity sufficient to enable the person whose premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search ": Parker v Churchill [1986] FCA 88 ; (1986) 9 FCR 334 at 348 per Jackson J; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151 at 153 per Lockhart J. But there has since been a retreat from such an exacting standard. The " precision required ", it has since been suggested, " may vary with the nature of the offence, the other circumstances revealed, the particularity achieved in other respects, and what is disclosed by the warrant, read as a whole, and taking account of its recitals ": Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [1991] FCA 92 ; (1991) 31 FCR 523 at 543 per Burchett J. The objective of the requirement, however, has remained constant. The " requirement to state the offence exists to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant would involve . ...

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/166.html</AustLII>
<text>In such circumstances, that inference and that alone may be sufficient to form a conclusion that the balance of convenience rests heavily in favour of the Applicants. If interlocutory relief were to be refused, any success that the Applicants may have at a final hearing would be largely rendered nugatory: cf Price v Elder [2000] FCA 166 per Emmett J. The rights of individuals are not to be whittled away by conferring greater power upon those executing warrants than the already extensive power they presently possess. Damages, in such a context, may not be an adequate remedy.

Such factors, however, must necessarily be taken into account together with other considerations.

Also to be taken into account is the effect that the seizure of documents is having upon the business of the Applicants. That effect is not insignificant. Some significance is also to be attached to the estimated cost of about $240,000 that would be incurred by the Applicants in further reviewing the materials seized. Whether the task is as complex as is asserted and whether the costs are as high as may presently be believed may be queried. And, whatever may be the extent of those costs and whatever may be the explanation as may finally emerge, the Applicants have made decisions since April 2009 to not challenge the validity of the warrants or the manner of their execution until now. To now raise the question of costs is a very much belated consideration that should be given less weight than had such matters been raised at the outset. But some additional costs will unquestionably be incurred and some weight can be given to that consideration when assessing the balance of convenience.</text>

<tocase>Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393</tocase>
<text>First, Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondents quite properly relied upon the public interest in permitting those responsible for enforcement of the criminal law to continue their investigations. This consideration was rightly advanced as of relevance to both the discretion to grant interlocutory relief and to the discretion to grant an extension of time pursuant to s 11(1)(c) of the Judicial Review Act . In Coward v Allen [1984] FCA 53 ; (1984) 52 ALR 320 Northrop J had concluded in respect to a warrant issued under the now-repealed s 10 of the Crimes Act that there was a serious question to be tried in relation " to the manner in which the warrants were executed and whether the seizure of things was valid ": (1984) 52 ALR at 336. His Honour nevertheless declined relief. In doing so His Honour concluded: 
 
 In my opinion, the motions for interlocutory injunctions should be refused. The balance of convenience weighs in favour of the respondents. In the public interest, they should have a reasonable time to examine the things seized, to decide whether to prosecute or not, and to retain the things needed as evidence in support of any prosecutions. The other things should be returned to the applicants. The court hearing those criminal proceedings may have to determine, on the principles expressed in Bunning v Cross , whether evidence obtained by means of the search warrants is admissible or not. Any civil action arising from the seizure could be continued at the conclusion of those criminal proceedings. If no prosecutions are commenced, the applicants would be free to continue with their actions based on the unlawful execution of the warrants. In the meantime, the public interest requires that the respondents to the actions should be able to continue their investigations. Accordingly, the motions for interlocutory injunctions are refused. 
 

 
 A valuable safeguard which adequately protected the interests of those whose property was wrongly seized lay, it was said, in the discretion of the Court &#8212; should there be a prosecution &#8212; to exclude such evidence. In the context of considering whether documents should be returned, in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 405, Hill J likewise observed:
 
 
 I am thus placed in the situation where there are competing views, although it must be said that the preponderance of view is in favour of refusing to order the return of items, even where those items have been illegally seized, if there are criminal proceedings pending in which the items may be used as evidence. While the court would not wish to be seen to be rewarding members of the police who obtain possession of material without lawful authority, there is to be weighed against that a public interest in the administration of and non-interference with justice. Should the court order that material, albeit invalidly obtained, to be used in evidence in a pending prosecution be delivered up to those from whom it was taken the prosecution, which might otherwise succeed, could be frustrated. 
 

 
 
 Of course, the question whether the items in the present case, if otherwise admissible, should be admitted in evidence in the pending prosecution, despite the fact that they were obtained without lawful authority, will be a matter for the judicial officer hearing the prosecution: Bunning v Cross [1978] HCA 22 ; (1978) 141 CLR 54 ; 19 ALR 641. The existence of this discretion suggests to me that I should not interfere with the pending prosecution by requiring the documents seized to be returned but leave instead to the judicial officer presiding on that prosecution the question whether the material illegally obtained should be admitted into evidence in the prosecution.

The importance of the enforcement of the criminal law may readily be accepted. It is self-evidently in the public interest that those who commit criminal offences should be brought to account. Those who commit fraud, including a fraud upon the public revenue, should be brought to account. It is equally of importance that those investigating suspected criminal conduct be able to exercise all powers as are conferred upon them by the legislature to access materials and to secure the availability of all materials lawfully seized for the purposes of any subsequent proceeding. But it is not considered that either Northrop J or Hill J was attempting to do anything other than to recognise that aspect of the public interest and apply it to the facts before them.</text>
