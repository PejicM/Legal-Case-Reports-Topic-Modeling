<text>8. On 13 October 2005 the applicant lodged his current application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court to review the delegate's decision and that application was dismissed on 13 February 2006. 
 

4 The Magistrate said that the applicant's application challenges the delegate's decision and she said it was doomed to fail because, among other things, the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal.
 
5 I do not think that the applicant's proposed appeal enjoys any reasonable prospect of success. This case is similar to the case which came before Wilcox J in SZDFW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1821. The Tribunal conducted a full merits review in relation to the decision of the delegate and the applicant was given every opportunity to present his case (see s 415 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344). This Court found that the decision of the Tribunal was in no way affected by jurisdictional error. The delegate's decision is now of no significance having regard to the fact that it was reviewed by the Tribunal.
 
6 I think that in view of the history of this matter as I have outlined it, the order prohibiting without leave the filing of a further application to review the decision of the delegate and the decision of the Tribunal is justified.
 
7 The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.
 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.
