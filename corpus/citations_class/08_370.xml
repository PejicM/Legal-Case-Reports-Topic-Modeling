<tocase>Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods (No.2) [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/1999/991.html</AustLII>
<text>106 The position of s 52 of the TPA is dealt with expressly by s 51AF(2)(a). It provides that s 52 does not apply to conduct engaged in "in relation to financial services". The scope of s 51AF(2) was considered by Austin J in Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods (No.2) (1999) 32 ACSR 701 ; [1999] NSWSC 991. At [109] , his Honour said:
 
 The words "in relation to" are well recognised as words of expansive meaning (eg Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1960) 105 CLR 602). The fact that conduct is in relation to other matters does not prevent it from being in relation to financial services as well. Once it is so classified, the Trade Practices Act is inapplicable and the matter falls within legislation for which ASIC has sole responsibility, namely the ASIC Act and the Corporations Law.

107 His Honour was, in my respectful view, correct in the view that where the misleading conduct can fairly be characterised as being both in relation to financial services and otherwise, then the fact that it is so capable of that first characterisation is enough to produce the result that s 52 of the TPA does not apply to the conduct.

108 However, his Honour's observations do not provide guidance for answering the anterior question, namely, when can conduct be taken as being engaged in "in relation to financial services".

109 The extrinsic material to which I was referred suggests that the exemption in s 51AF of the TPA should be broadly construed. Section 51AF was inserted into the TPA by the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Act 1998 (Cth). In the second reading speech to the Bill which became that Act, the Treasurer said that the relevant amendment would "confer on ASIC sole responsibility for consumer protection in relation to financial services". The Treasurer also said that the amendment would remove regulatory overlap and that ASIC would become "the specialist regulator for consumer protection in the financial system". Comments such as these suggest that if there is a possibility of jurisdictional overlap, then the Parliament intended that the matter should more properly fall within the jurisdiction of ASIC and thus within the ambit of the ASIC Act rather than the TPA.</text>

<tocase>Workers' Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Proprietary Limited [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/49.html</AustLII>
<text>110 While it is true that, in general, the words "in relation to" are words of expansive meaning, it is also the case, as the applicants submit, that words of that kind take colour from their particular statutory context. As Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in relation to the similarly much-litigated term "in respect of" in Workers' Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Proprietary Limited [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642 at 653-654:
 
 Undoubtedly the words "in respect of" have a wide meaning, although it is going somewhat too far to say ... that "they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation between the two subject-matters to which the words refer". The phrase gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends. (Emphasis added.)</text>

<tocase>Technical Products Pty Limited v State Government Insurance Office (Queensland) [1989] HCA 24 ; (1989) 167 CLR 45</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/24.html</AustLII>
<text>111 The point was developed by the High Court in Technical Products Pty Limited v State Government Insurance Office (Queensland) [1989] HCA 24 ; (1989) 167 CLR 45 where the phrase "in respect of" was held to require a "discernible and rational link", and that a "material connection" (rather than a mere coincidental or extraneous connection) should exist between the two facts or concepts whose relation is in question. It is, to my mind, inescapable that, whether there is a "rational" link or a "material" connection involves a degree of judgment about the sufficiency of the link or connection for the relevant statutory purpose.

112 In Technical Products [1989] HCA 24 ; 167 CLR 45 , a man fell off a pallet which was supported by a forklift, and sustained injury. He was on the pallet in order to load bags of cheese salt onto a trailer (a "motor vehicle" as relevantly defined). There was no adequate system to prevent him falling seven feet to the ground. The injured man sued his employer, which sought indemnification under a motor vehicle insurance policy taken out for the trailer. Whether or not the employer was entitled to indemnification turned upon whether the employer fell within s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act 1936 (Qld). Section 3(1) required the owner of a motor vehicle to effect insurance cover against:
 
 all sums for which he ... shall become legally liable by way of damages in respect of such motor vehicle for accidental bodily injury ... where such injury is caused by, through, or in connection with such motor vehicle.

113 The majority held that the employer's legal liability was not "in respect of" the motor vehicle. Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ concluded at 48 that:
 
 The effect of the words "in respect of such motor vehicle" ... [is to] add ... the further requirement that the circumstances giving rise to the relevant legal liability by way of damages for that injury show a discernible and rational link between the liability and the particular vehicle. (Emphasis added.)

114 Their Honours explained at 47-48:
 
 The words "in respect of" have a very wide meaning. Indeed, they have a chameleon-like quality in that they commonly reflect the context in which they appear . The nexus between legal liability and motor vehicle which their use introduces in s 3(1) is a broad one which is not susceptible of precise definition. That nexus will not, however, exist unless there be some discernible and rational link between the basis of legal liability and the particular motor vehicle. The point is well made in the judgment of Connolly J (with whom Andrews CJ and Thomas J concurred) in the Full Court of the Supreme Court in the present case:
 
 
 
 "... it is not sufficient , in order to satisfy the requirement that the person entitled to the benefit of the cover be "legally liable ... in respect of such motor vehicle", that there be no more than a connexion or relation in time or sequence between the motor vehicle and events which in law give rise to the liability. What is required is that there be a relationship between the motor vehicle and the very act or omission which gives rise to that liability ." 
 
 
 
 Thus, the requisite relationship between liability and the particular motor vehicle will ordinarily not exist where the liability is that of a person who is unconnected with that vehicle. The point can be illustrated by example. If, for example, a passenger in a motor vehicle is injured when the driver of the vehicle brakes suddenly to avoid another vehicle whose brakes have failed because of a mechanic's negligence in servicing them, the passenger's injuries can properly be seen as caused "in connection with" each of the two vehicles involved. Any liability of the mechanic in damages for the passenger's injuries would be a liability "in respect of" the second vehicle whose brakes he had negligently serviced. The mechanic's liability could not, however, rationally be seen as a liability "in respect of" the first vehicle with which he had no connexion at all. (Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added.)

115 Their Honours applied their reasoning to the facts as follows (at 49):
 
 Even accepting that the trailer and the container are properly to be regarded as one receptacle, the employer's liability cannot, in the circumstances, properly be described as a liability with respect to that receptacle. To the extent that the employer's liability was a liability "in respect of" any vehicle, it was a liability with respect to the unregistered fork-lift. There is nothing in the present case which would justify a conclusion that the trailer and container had any involvement in the employee's accident beyond their passive presence as the receptacle into which the bags were being loaded.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Citrofresh [2007] FCA 1873</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1873.html</AustLII>
<text>121 I note that recently, in Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Citrofresh [2007] FCA 1873 , Goldberg J (at [71]) expressed similar cautions about a too expansive approach to the phrase "in relation to".

122 The above analysis has focused upon the terms of s 51AF(2) of the TPA, which relates to s 52 of the TPA. No special provision is made within s 51AF as to s 53(g) of the TPA. Accordingly, to determine whether a matter should be pursued under s 53(g) of the TPA or its ASIC Act analogue requires recourse only to s 51AF(1) which provides: "This Part does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services."

123 On one view, it could be said that the more specific provision in s 51AF(2) carves out a wider field of exemption from the TPA than does s 51AF(1) when read in isolation. However, I agree with the applicants that such a construction makes little sense, particularly given that the same conduct can often involve the closest of distinctions as to whether it contravenes s 52 or s 53(g). The requisite purposive construction requires 

 
that s 53(g) of the TPA be rendered inapplicable in the same circumstances as s 52 of the TPA.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd (ACN 065 378 029) [2002] FCA 1439</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1439.html</AustLII>
<text>149 Whether Mama's had reasonable grounds for believing the truth of representations about a future matter involves an objective test. The same is not true of the alleged personal accessories: the applicants must "demonstrate that such a person:
 
&#8226; knew that the representation was made, and either:
 
&#8226; knew that it was misleading; or
 
&#8226; knew that the corporation had no reasonable grounds for making it": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd (ACN 065 378 029) [2002] FCA 1439 at [303] per Dowsett J. Nor, unlike the corporation involved (cf s 51 TPA) does a natural person bear any onus.

150 I accept the applicants' submissions that:
 
&#8226; The following representations can be characterised as representations as to future matters:
 
 
 (a) if not satisfied and provided a 6 or 12 month period had expired since the oven was supplied, the proprietor had a right to require Mama's to take the oven back whereupon they would be released from all financial obligations in respect of the oven;
 (b) if not satisfied and provided a 6 or 12 month period had expired since the oven was supplied, the proprietor had a right to require Mama's to cancel the lease with the financier whereupon they would be released from all financial obligations in respect of the oven;
 (c) the supply of the oven was financially risk free. 
 

&#8226; There is no evidence that Mama's had reasonable grounds for believing that any of those representations was true. As to Mr Hilder and Mr Soo respectively, to the extent that each was involved, he knew that the representation was made and either knew that it was misleading or that Mama's had no reasonable grounds for making it.
 
&#8226; There is no doubt that the representations were misleading and deceptive:
 
 
 (i) the oven recipient would not be released from all financial obligations in respect of the oven upon its return after the nominated trial period;
 (ii) Mama's was legally unable to cancel the lease with the financier upon such return; and
 (iii) the acceptance of the oven from Mama's was far from financially risk-free: any such freedom depended on Mama's willingness, if need be, to sustain a substantial loss in respect of the oven and, at least, to put itself heavily out of pocket in relation to the oven until a resale of the oven and, in reality, permanently out of pocket to some degree, even assuming the willingness of the financier to finance a resale or to accept termination of its lease arrangement.

151 Quite apart from these in limine ways in which the representations were misleading and deceptive, there are other grounds for so concluding:
 
&#8226; In none of the five cases was the oven taken back as requested or provided. Nor were the oven operators released from their financial obligations to the financiers. They were landed with an overpriced oven which, on the respondents' recommended system, had proven unprofitable, and were subject to substantial credit charges under a long-term contract. That is a long way from supposedly having entered into a financially risk-free arrangement.
 
&#8226; Neither Mama's nor Mr Hilder had any arrangement with the financiers that envisaged a six (or 12) month trial period or a release of the lessee from obligations after 6 (or 12) months for any reason whatsoever.
 
&#8226; Both Mr Hilder and Mr Soo (especially Mr Hilder but, quite firmly in my mind, also Mr Soo) well knew that they were at least gilding the lily. They both knew the propensity of financiers to insist upon the performance of obligations to them by their borrowers and quasi-borrowers. They both knew that what they were telling their prospects who became oven recipients was not in accordance with the realities of loan financing and the ease of resale of a second-hand oven originally sold at greatly over value. 
 
&#8226; They both knew all the essential ingredients of the misleading and deceptive aspect of the transactions which I have identified. Mr Soo understood the financing arrangements. He knew that, as between the oven "owners" and the financiers, there was a 60 month deal, not one for a risk free 6 month trial. Mr Hilder negotiated the financing. 
 
&#8226; Mr Hilder preferred not to face up to the complainants. Mama's entire system of operations was his invention.</text>

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 527 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/527.html</AustLII>
<text>157 Both personal respondents have experience in selling food preparation equipment to food retailers, and may be expected to wish to continue to do so. In any case s 80 has given the Court, as Lockhart J put it in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 527 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 256: "the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly".

158 In the same case, French J pointed out, at 268:
 
 There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court.

159 In my view, it is desirable in this case to have regard to such likely deterrent effect of injunctions. I will issue appropriate injunctions.

160 Section 83 of the TPA provides (and its ASIC Act analogue provides in substance):
 
 In a proceeding against a person under section 82 or in an application under subsection 87(1A) for an order against a person, a finding of any fact by a court made in proceedings under section 77, 80, 81, 86C or 86D, or for an offence against a provision of Part VC, in which that person has been found to have contravened, or to have been involved in a contravention of, a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC is prima facie evidence of that fact and the finding may be proved by production of a document under the seal of the court from which the finding appears.</text>

<text>161 Section 83 is an evidentiary aid to the proof of facts. There are other proceedings on foot against the respondents and there may well be more to come. The applicants, however, appear to conceive that s 83 is the source of a positive remedy for the instant applicants , presumably for members of the public generally. They seek "findings of fact against [Mr Hilder and Mr Soo] pursuant to s 83 ... and under its ASIC analogue ..." (emphasis added). In ACCC v Leahy Petroleum (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 (at [74]) it appears from Merkel J's judgment that the ACCC "sought an order under s 83 ... that the findings of fact contained in my reasons of judgment be findings of fact for the purposes of s 83".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/303.html</AustLII>
<text>163 The applicants say that such a practice reduces the difficulty for other courts in deciding whether a passage in reasons for judgment amounts to or contains a finding of fact, cf Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean Distributors Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 303 at [17] per Nicholson J. Merkel J had declined to do this. He thought it was enough (but, it seems, necessary) to order that a copy of the reasons "be under the seal of the Court and be held in the Melbourne Registry...". Nicholson J thought (and on this scope I agree with him) that such an order was unnecessary.

164 While s 83 occurs in Part VI of the TPA, entitled "Enforcement and Remedies", I do not see it as having been intended to provide a present applicant with a positive present remedy, even for other misled or deceived people, except insofar as that applicant might, like anyone else, wish to take advantage of the evidentiary help which the section provides of its own force to people at large against an erring respondent. It is to be contrasted with s 86C. In particular cases, it may indeed be generally helpful for the Court to collect and formalise its findings of fact. There is however no requirement for a busy court to do so. The suggested practice may also actually run up costs in some cases by causing debate (or even appeal) about the precise content of the proposed formal findings of fact. What degree of formality the findings of fact should take should be left to the good sense of the judge in the particular case.

165 I have, I hope, expressed myself with reasonable clarity. This case does not depend on fine distinctions. I do not intend to follow the course suggested.

166 The applicants seek orders under s 86C that Mr Hilder and Mr Soo each:
 
(1) disclose the persons to whom they have supplied food preparation equipment;
 
(2) tell all such persons of my judgment and orders and advise them of TPA or ASIC Act rights they may have;
 
(3) publicly advertise the information referred to in (1) and (2);
 
(4) identify financiers of such supplied equipment;
 
(5) verify their compliance with the foregoing orders;
 
(6) attend, and verify attendance at, seminars on Part V TPA and Part 2 Div 2 ASIC Act compliance.

167 I will make the requested orders referred to as (1) to (5) inclusive above. I will however allow liberty to the second and third respondents to apply in relation to any bona fide difficulty either of them may face in complying with the orders as framed.</text>
