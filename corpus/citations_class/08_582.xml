<tocase>Rupert Co v Chameleon Mining (2006) 24 ACLC 635</tocase>
<text>24 Rupert Co v Chameleon Mining (2006) 24 ACLC 635 presented factual circumstances somewhat similar to those of the present case. Austin J stated in that case (at [15]) that in the exercise of its discretion whether to terminate the winding up, the Court considers the interests of creditors (including future creditors), the liquidator, contributories and the public.

25 In the present case, the application is made by the Liquidators; the existing creditors have voted in favour of the DOCA and the Terraplanet Creditors' Trust; and the contributories (that is, the shareholders) have voted in favour of the various resolutions to implement the recapitalisation proposal.

26 Terraplanet is released from all existing debts under an arrangement that sees existing creditors better off than they would be if the winding up were to proceed to finalisation.

27 This leaves future creditors to be considered. In substance, Terraplanet is to commence its commercial life again. No doubt Dalgety is of the view that its capitalisation of Terraplanet is adequate to enable it to succeed commercially.

28 In the light of the absence of any existing debts and of the recapitalisation of the company, I infer that Terraplanet is solvent. There is no reason to doubt, on the present evidence, that the company will be able to pay debts it will incur as and when they fall due after it recommences business.</text>
