<text>9 In particular, I see no reason why the Court's incidental power to grant a person leave to appear by a non-lawyer and the power to do so under s 85 of the NTA should not involve similar considerations, particularly in the current context. In Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 871 , Lindgren J stated at [20] in relation to an application for leave under s 85: 
 
 'What should be clearly understood is that leave is required because it is not to be taken for granted that a person who is not a solicitor or barrister will be allowed to represent a party. Perhaps Dolly Walker thinks that leave is granted as a matter of course, just for the asking. This is not so and for good reason. Solicitors and barristers are qualified by education and training to represent parties and are subject to professional and curial disciplines and responsibilities. The requirement of leave is imposed for the reason that the Court must be satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice in all the circumstances that a party be represented by a person who is not a solicitor or barrister.'

 2. Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the native title group.
 3. The person to be replaced is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.
 4. Alternatively, the person to be replaced has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group.
 5. The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising under it.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/894.html</AustLII>
<text>2 On 13 July 2001, I rejected an application made under s 66B to remove the Lawsons as the applicant: Johnson, in the matter of Lawson v Lawson [2001] FCA 894. Although I accepted that the Lawsons had lost the confidence of some important members of the Claim Group I was not satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to show that the Claim Group, by appropriate decision-making processes, had revoked their authority to represent it or had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them.</text>

<tocase>Johnson on behalf of the Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 981</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/981.html</AustLII>
<text>10 In opposing the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear, Ms Phillips, who appeared for New South Wales Native Title Services ('NTS'), pointed out that the application for leave (which was signed by Mr Dengate) sought to have him represent Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson not only in respect of the present motion but also in the substantive proceedings. The notion that there is any scope for members of the applicant group to be separately represented fundamentally misconceives the role of those comprising an applicant in native title proceedings. As I pointed out in Johnson on behalf of the Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 981 (' Johnson ') at [8]:
 
 'Such applicants are representatives of the claimant group; they have no personal interest other than as members of the claimant group and for this reason their interests do not differ from each other or from the claimant group and separate representation is inappropriate and unacceptable.'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1411.html</AustLII>
<text>11 I am satisfied that, in the present circumstances, it is not in the interests of justice for Mr Dengate to be permitted to represent Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson. With the greatest respect to Mr Dengate, and despite his genuine commitment to his clients, I am convinced that he has neither the discipline nor the understanding to assist them or the Court. I am confirmed in this view by my previous experience of Mr Dengate as an advocate; see my comments in Johnson at [14]-[16] and Johnson on behalf of the Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 1411 at [4] - [6] . For these reasons I declined to grant leave for Mr Dengate to appear.

12 It is also relevant to note that Messrs Lawson and Johnson have some experience in native title proceedings in this Court and, as it transpired, their evidence and submissions at the motion hearing were cogent, relevant and explained the dispute between the parties clearly.

13 A further issue was raised at the directions hearing of 5 December 2005 in relation to the suitability or otherwise of the proposed hearing date; 13 December 2005. Mr Dengate contended that there had been delays in the service of the documents relating to the motion. He stated that Mr Lawson had not been served with all the documents until 21 November 2005. Consequently, he argued that it was not appropriate to hear the motion on 13 December 2005.</text>

<tocase>Lawson on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1517.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Following unsuccessful attempts to mediate the issues within the Claim Group, a further application to replace the Lawsons was successful. On 9 December 2002, I ordered that Ray Lawson, Noel Johnson, Mary-Ann Marton, Jennifer Whyman and Patricia Johnson replace the Lawsons as the applicant: Lawson on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 (' Lawson '). On 29 September 2004, the application was amended to add William Bates, Maureen O'Donnell and Cyril Hunter to the group comprising the applicant. These eight individuals presently comprise the applicant in this proceeding.

4 On 23 December 2004, the NNTT refused to accept the amended application for registration. Subsequently, a dispute about the future conduct of the proceeding arose between Ray Lawson and Noel Johnson and the other members of the applicant group. In essence, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson believe that the area subject to the claim should be split between two claims, those of the people they regard as 'pure' Barkandji people and those of the other members of the Claim Group.

5 Attempts to resolve the dispute referred to above have been unsuccessful and, pursuant to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Claim Group on 1 October 2005, culminated in the filing of a notice of motion on 14 October 2005. By this notice of motion, an amended version of which was filed in Court on 13 December 2005, members of the Claim Group seek an order under s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NTA') replacing the current applicant on grounds that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. In effect the motion seeks: (a) to remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group as well as a third member, Mrs Patricia Johnson; and (b) to add two new members, Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman. Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson oppose the application to remove them; Mrs Johnson has not appeared or made any submissions however it is alleged that, because of her ill health, she no longer wishes to be part of the group that comprises the applicant or to be involved in the management of the proceeding.

36 For the above reasons, I will make the orders sought in the amended notice filed on 13 December 2005. However, it is pertinent to note that in making these orders the Court is not adversely reflecting in any way on the conduct of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson. There clearly has been a deeply held disagreement within the Claim Group and this has been resolved in accordance with the provisions of the NTA. As was discussed at the 1 October meeting, an order made under s 66B(2) of the NTA does not remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the Claim Group, nor does it affect their standing according to traditional law and custom. As members of the Claim Group both will continue to have the opportunity to participate in discussions as to the future conduct of the native title claim and it is to be hoped that they will avail themselves of the opportunity to do so.

<tocase>Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1481.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Section 85 of the NTA provides that a 'party may appear in person or may be represented by a barrister, a solicitor or, with the leave of the Federal Court, another person'. Although Messrs Lawson and Johnson are members of the applicant group they are not, as individuals, parties to this proceeding: see s 61(2) of the NTA. Nevertheless they are, effectively, the contradictors to the present motion. I am satisfied, therefore, that under the Court's power to do that which is incidental or necessary to the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in this case by s 66B of the NTA, I have jurisdiction to entertain the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear. In Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481 , Bennett J helpfully summarised the Court's 'inherent' power in this regard at [5]-[15]. While I would prefer to take the approach advocated in Parsons v Martin (1984) 5 FCR 235 at 241 and refer to this power as an 'incidental and necessary power of a statutory court' rather than as 'inherent', I respectfully accept her Honour's statement of the generally applicable principles.</text>

<tocase>Noble v Murgha [2005] FCAFC 211</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/211.html</AustLII>
<text>27 Subsection 61(2) of the NTA provides that the persons authorised to make the claimant application by the native title claim group are jointly the 'applicant' and none of the other members of the native title claim group is the 'applicant'. This leads to the somewhat awkward situation where the term 'applicant' is applied to a group of separately named individuals: see Noble v Murgha [2005] FCAFC 211 at [6] . Other provisions of the NTA relevant to the present application are:
 
 ' 66B Replacing the applicant 
 Application to replace applicant in claimant application 
 
 
 (1) One or more members of the native title claim group (the claim group ) in relation to a claimant application, or of the compensation claim group (also the claim group ) in relation to a compensation application, may apply to the Federal Court for an order that the member, or the members jointly, replace the current applicant for the application on the grounds that: 
 
 
 (a) either: 
 (i) the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; or 
 (ii) the current applicant has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the member or members are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. 
 
 
 
 Court order 
 
 
 (2) The Court may make the order if it is satisfied that the grounds are established.' 
 
 
 
 ' 251B Authorising the making of applications 
 For the purposes of this Act, all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if: 
 
 (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or 
 (b) where there is no such process--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind.'</text>

<tocase>Parsons v Martin (1984) 5 FCR 235</tocase>
<text>8 Section 85 of the NTA provides that a 'party may appear in person or may be represented by a barrister, a solicitor or, with the leave of the Federal Court, another person'. Although Messrs Lawson and Johnson are members of the applicant group they are not, as individuals, parties to this proceeding: see s 61(2) of the NTA. Nevertheless they are, effectively, the contradictors to the present motion. I am satisfied, therefore, that under the Court's power to do that which is incidental or necessary to the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in this case by s 66B of the NTA, I have jurisdiction to entertain the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear. In Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481 , Bennett J helpfully summarised the Court's 'inherent' power in this regard at [5]-[15]. While I would prefer to take the approach advocated in Parsons v Martin (1984) 5 FCR 235 at 241 and refer to this power as an 'incidental and necessary power of a statutory court' rather than as 'inherent', I respectfully accept her Honour's statement of the generally applicable principles.</text>

<text>29 It is pertinent to note, however, that the Court retains a discretion not to make the orders sought under s 66B of the NTA: see Ward v Northern Territory [2002] FCA 171 (' Ward ') at [16] and Daniel at [18].</text>

<text>28 In Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 (' Daniel ') at [17], French J drew from s 66B the following conditions that must be met for an order under the section to be made:
 
 
 1. There is a claimant application.
 2. Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the native title group.
 3. The person to be replaced is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.
 4. Alternatively, the person to be replaced has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group.
 5. The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising under it.
