<tocase>Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1242.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Pursuant to that liberty, Bowesco and Lanepoint, by their common director, Karen Carey-Hazell, have each applied to the Court for orders directing the receiver to make provisions to enable them to meet various legal expenses including the costs of resisting the winding up applications in proceedings WAD 177 of 2006 ( ASIC v Bowesco ) and WAD 152 of 2006 ( ASIC v Lanepoint ). They also apply for funding for legal services in relation to the prosecution of an application by Bowesco for leave to appeal against my decision, made on 14 September 2006, relating to Bowesco's entitlement to an option to purchase certain property, which option had been assigned to it by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242. Pursuant to an order made by Siopis J on 17 October 2006 a motion for leave to appeal out of time and for leave to appeal that decision was referred to the Full Court in the November sittings. The applications also seek orders for the provision of funding for legal services in relation to certain other matters.

4 The applications, insofar as they relate to the winding up proceedings, are made pursuant to the liberty to apply given on 30 August 2006 in those proceedings. The other directions sought, although brought in these winding up proceedings, should properly be the subject of separate substantive applications. I am prepared, however, because of the urgency of the matters and particularly the pending application by Bowesco for leave to appeal in relation to the option dispute, to deal with the merits of those applications in this judgment on the basis that any substantive application should be filed before the orders sought take effect.

5 The Court is asked to make all of the orders sought as an exercise of the power conferred upon it by s 423(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). That provision allows for a person to complain to the Court about an act or omission of a controller of property of a corporation in connection with performing or exercising any of the controller's functions and powers. In such a case the Court may inquire into the matter and, where the Court so inquires, it may take such action as it thinks fit. For reasons given below, I do not consider that s 423(1)(b) is an appropriate basis for the orders sought as an incident of the winding up application. Indeed, it seems to have been put forward by Lanepoint and Bowesco as opening a doorway to a broader inquiry into the conduct of the receiverships.

6 The alternative basis upon which the applications rest is s 1321 of the Act. Lanepoint and Bowesco in effect appeal to this Court against the refusal by their receivers and managers to make available, out of the funds under their control, funding for legal representation in the winding up proceedings and for the other purposes to which reference has been made.

7 For the reasons that follow, in my opinion, provision should be made by the receivers and managers of Lanepoint for Bowesco's reasonable legal costs in defending the winding up application brought against it, in meeting the legal costs of this application and in prosecuting its application for leave to appeal. The orders sought by Lanepoint are not acceded to nor the remaining orders sought by Bowesco.</text>

<text>11 On 20 April 2006 freezing orders were made against Bowesco in respect of its assets pursuant to s 1323 of the Act: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. Those orders were varied on 30 June 2006 and expressed to permit the Bowesco receivers appointed by Suncorp-Metway to exercise their powers pursuant to their appointment including their powers under s 420 of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Re Geneva Finance Ltd [1992] 7 WAR 496</tocase>
<text>12 On 30 August 2006 I made the orders earlier referred to declaring that the sole director of Lanepoint and Bowesco, Karen Carey-Hazell, was entitled to defend the winding up proceedings in the name of the companies. The practical concern relevant to whether Ms Carey-Hazell could defend the winding up applications was whether her exercise of powers in their names would interfere with the legitimate exercise by the receivers of their powers. As Owen J said in Re Geneva Finance Ltd [1992] 7 WAR 496: 
 
 'The real question is whether the directors, wishing to exercise a power which they would otherwise have, can do so without prejudicing the legitimate interests of the receiver and the secured creditor in the realisation of the asset.' 


The receivers do not oppose the ASIC winding up applications. There was no actual or apparent conflict between their position and Ms Carey-Hazell's proposed opposition. I said (at [24]): 
 
 
 'Absent Ms Carey-Hazell's participation as proposed, there is no contradictor to the winding up application. She asserts that there is a case to be made against the orders sought by ASIC. Quite apart from the question of her entitlement to bring that contention before the Court, it is in the interests of justice that as a director of the company she has an opportunity to make that case if she does so in accordance with the duties imposed upon her by the Act and not, for example, for some collateral purpose. In so doing, it should not be assumed that Ms Carey-Hazell will have any a priori entitlement to resort to the assets of the company for the purpose of funding legal representation in the winding up proceeding. I will, however, allow liberty to apply at the termination of the proceedings in that respect.'

13 The orders sought by Bowesco and Lanepoint in these applications are in identical terms: 
 
 
 '2. The Receivers and Managers of the Respondent be directed to make provision for the funding of legal costs for the purposes of legal advice and representation relating to solicitor/client costs and expenses for: 
 
 
 
 
 
 a. $50,000 for the defence of action WAD 177 of 2006 (" the Bowesco Proceedings ") pursuant to Liberty to Apply; 
 b. $50,000 for the defence of action WAD 152 of 2006 (" the Lanepoint Proceedings ") pursuant to Liberty to Apply; 
 c. $80,000 for an appeal against the decision of Justice French made 14 September 2006 in the Bowesco Option Dispute proceedings in WAD 83 of 2006 (" the Bowesco Option Dispute "); 
 d. $50,000 for advice in relation to the asset preservation proceedings in WAD 83 of 2006 in relation to Bowesco (" the Asset Preservation Proceedings ")' and 
 e. $15,000 for tax advice in relation to Lanepoint; 
 f. $10,000 for advice in relation to the costs and conduct of the Receivers and Managers of the Respondent; and 
 g. $7,500 for the bringing and prosecution of this application. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The Receivers and Managers of the Respondent be directed to provide the Respondent with a statement of the current financial position of the Company. 
 4. The costs of this application, including any reserved costs, be paid by the Receivers and Managers of the Respondent.'

14 Ms Carey-Hazell and the companies' solicitor, Mr John Hammond, have sworn affidavits in the winding up proceedings in support of the directions sought against the receivers. Mr Hammond deposed that the companies have been unable to provide funding for the purpose of legal advice in the winding up proceedings as any requests for funding have been refused by the receivers and managers.</text>

<tocase>Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215</tocase>
<text>47 The general entitlement of a receiver appointed under a charge to deduct and retain, out of the funds realised, costs, charges and expense incurred in the realisation was asserted as a matter of general principle in Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215 at 222 (Murphy J) and 229 (Tadgell J). In Nicobar Pty Ltd v Abrokiss (2003) 48 ACSR 259, Young CJ said (at [60]):
 
 'The general rule is that where a person who is a fiduciary or an officer of the court produces a fund through his own effort, he is entitled to an equitable lien over the fund in respect of defending himself against claims made against him for what he did in producing the fund.' 
 

His Honour, however, was not prepared to accept that an equitable lien might exist in the case of a privately appointed receiver, saying (at [62]):
 
 
 'Although the scope of equitable liens is wide and the boundaries are flexible, and although a receiver appointed out of court owes fiduciary duties both to his appointor and perhaps also to the mortgagor, I do not consider that the principle applies to receivers appointed out of court. If this were not so, there would be little point in the authorities continuing to emphasise the fact that the receivers in the successful cases of lien were receivers appointed by the court.' 
 

His Honour referred to O'Donnell, Company Receivers &amp; Administrators at [12.109] (Update 40) and Harris &amp; Lewin Pty Ltd (in liq) v Harris &amp; Lewin Agents Pty Ltd (1975-76) CLC 40-216. He further observed that (at [64]):
 
 
 'The receiver is usually the agent of the mortgagor company and may have a lien against the assets of the company, but this will not normally have force against a secured creditor.'</text>
