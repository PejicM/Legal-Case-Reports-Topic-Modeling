<tocase>Ariss v Express Interiors Pty Ltd (In Liq) [1996] 2 VR 507</tocase>
<text>24 That is not confined to persons who control the company, but extends to those who will have the benefit of the proceedings if they succeed: Microcorp Pty Ltd v Terran Computers Pty Ltd (unreported, 26 June 1992, Northrop J); Caruso Australia Pty Ltd v Portec (Aust) Pty Ltd (1984) 1 FCR 311. In Caruso , Toohey J at 314 considered that it was reasonable that the two major and arms length creditors be expected to contribute to any security that may be ordered. See also John Arnold's Surf Shop Pty Ltd (In liq) v Heller Factors Pty Ltd (1979) 22 SASR 20; Pacific Acceptance Corp Ltd v Forsyth (No 2) [1967] 2 NSWR 402; Drumdurno Pty Ltd v Braham (1982) 42 ALR 563; Ariss v Express Interiors Pty Ltd (In Liq) [1996] 2 VR 507 at 508; Attorney-General v Transport Control Systems (NZ) Ltd [1982] 2 NZLR 19 at 20; Memutu Pty Ltd v Lissenden (1983) 8 ACLR 364 at 365-366; Reches Pty Ltd v Tadiran Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 514 at 523.

27 Given the extent to which Deumer stands to gain from the proceedings if they are successful, and that the cause of action is apparently the only asset of Cosdean which may enable it to be paid, or to be substantially paid, under its agency agreement with Cosdean, and that in essence it has no real competing external creditors who might participate in any award of damages, I think it is reasonable that Deumer support Cosdean in the prosecution of the claim, or at least that it have the opportunity to do so. It may wish to make its own assessment of Cosdean's prospects of success in the proceedings or of the likely award of any damages, and balance those things against the amount of the further security for costs I have ordered. That is a matter for Cosdean and Deumer. The circumstances are different from those where there are a number of creditors, including small creditors: cf Yandil 3 ACLC 542 at 545; Tullock Ltd v Walker (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Yeldham J, 8 December 1976). There is no other evidence of commercial impracticability in Deumer supporting Cosdean in the claim; see Ariss (1996) 2 VR 507 at 515 per Phillips JA.</text>

<tocase>Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp (1984) 2 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>19 Once the threshold prescribed by s 1335 is satisfied, the discretion as to whether to order security for costs is an unqualified one: Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 3; Sir Lindsay Parkinson &amp; Co Ltd v Triplan Ltd [1973] QB 609; Spiel v Commodity Brokers Australia Pty Ltd (In liq) (1983) 35 SASR 294; Ratepayers &amp; Residents Action Association Inc v Auckland City Council [1986] 1 NZLR 746.

25 Those cases reflect the policy underlying s 1335 that security may be ordered where a company appears to be in no position to provide security from its own resources where, in all the circumstances, it is reasonable that the resources of some other person or entity standing behind the company or of some person or entity for whose practical benefit the proceeding is being conducted should provide the security. The privilege of limited liability should not necessarily exclude those standing to benefit from proceedings by that company from having to provide support to it: Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 303-304. The approach was conveniently expressed in Bell Wholesale 2 FCR 1 at 4 where the Full Court (Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ) said:
 
 "In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the applicant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means."

28 Cosdean accepts that, where the opposition to an application for security for costs is based upon the assertion that the effect of an order for security for costs will stultify a bona fide claim, the onus is upon the party asserting that effect to prove it: see Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank [2001] NSWSC 744 at [51] - [52] and [66] per Einstein J; Bell Wholesale 2 FCR 1 at 4; Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research Pty Ltd (2004) 208 ALR 564 at 583. The last-mentioned case concerned a litigation funder, whose resources were considered to be relevant. Cosdean also accepts that there is no evidence that it has made any approach to Deumer to fund or support the proceedings, or to support any order for security for costs. There is no evidence to demonstrate that Deumer is either unable or unwilling to support Cosdean's action or of any other financial hardship or commercial impracticability in it doing so.

29 Consequently, as I consider for the reasons given that the circumstances of Deumer are properly to be taken into account in considering the applications, it follows that Cosdean has not demonstrated that further orders for security for costs would stultify the proceedings. It may be that Deumer is unable to support the proceedings but that is purely speculation. If it were not prepared to, but had the capacity to do so, in circumstances where it had in effect the first call upon the proceeds of the action to the extent of some $1.8 million, that in itself would be a relevant consideration as to whether to make further orders for security for costs.

30 As noted above, the respondents accept that Cosdean's claim is brought in good faith.</text>

<tocase>BPM Pty Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd (1996) 131 FLR 339</tocase>
<text>26 
 
In my view, having regard to the nature of the claim and the status of Deumer in relation to Cosdean and its real interest in the outcome of the proceedings, it is reasonable that the circumstances of Deumer should be taken into account on the applications for further security. In BPM Pty Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd (1996) 131 FLR 339 at 344, Anderson J adopted a similar approach. In other circumstances, the capacity of shareholders or directors of a limited liability company to support proceedings have been taken into account, as has the capacity of trustees of trading trusts, trust beneficiaries, members of associations, debenture holders, guarantors and appointors of receivers: see Colbran at [14.7] pp 237-238 and the cases cited there. The present circumstances provide simply another illustration of what may be taken into account, in appropriate circumstances, in addressing an application for security for costs against an impecunious corporate litigant.</text>
