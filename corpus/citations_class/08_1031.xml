<tocase>Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 124 CLR 97</tocase>
<text>59 Whether Lilyvale carried on the same business from 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2003 as it did immediately before either 8 or 30 August 2002 requires careful consideration of Lilyvale's activities and responsibilities both before and after the critical date in August 2002. The question is one of fact; Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 124 CLR 97 per Gibbs J at 104. There are two elements to the concept of a taxpayer "carrying on the same business" and both must be addressed. First, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the concept of carrying on a business, taking into account the relevant statutory and commercial context. Then, having established that before the critical date the taxpayer is carrying on a business and the nature or characterisation of that business, it is necessary to ask if the taxpayer carried on the same business after the critical date.

60 In Avondale Gibbs J rejected a submission that the word "same" in the phrase "same business" meant "similar" or "analogous" rather than "identical". His Honour accepted that the meaning, as with any ambiguous phrase, depends on context and held that in the context of s 80E(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1968 (Cth), a predecessor of the provision presently under consideration, the meaning was that of "identity". Gibbs J, at 105, found support for his view in a consideration of the purpose of the legislation: 
 This restriction is imposed to prevent persons from profiting by the acquisition of control of a company for the sole purpose of claiming its accrued losses as a tax deduction. However the restriction if imposed absolutely would lead to injustice in cases where a company, notwithstanding substantial changes in the ownership of its shares, continued to carry on the same business. No injustice would, in my opinion, result from a refusal to treat an accrued loss as a tax deduction where the company after the change carried on a different business, although one of a similar kind. 
Lilyvale therefore needs to show that the business it carried on after the share sale was identical to the business that it carried on in the relevant period before the share sale.

61 There was no issue as to the fact that Lilyvale was carrying on a business before the share sale. The parties do differ, however, as to their characterisation of that business. In submissions, Mr Slater QC, who appeared for Lilyvale, characterised its business, both before and after the sale, as carrying on "the business of hotelier or innkeeper at the premises in the Rocks". He submitted that in carrying on its business Lilyvale "provided accommodation for guests, provided restaurant facilities and meals for guests, and food and beverages in bars and so forth, convention facilities, parking facilities, laundry facilities and all the other things that a hotel provides to its customers or guests ... with three exceptions, it employed all the staff engaged in that enterprise". In contrast, the Commissioner submitted that Lilyvale's business consisted of the following: 
 
 
 &#8226; the provision of the physical asset ie., the Hotel;
 &#8226; the maintenance of an operating bank account in the name of Lilyvale Hotel Pty Ltd in which [Enterprises Australia] deposited receipts and from which [Enterprises Australia] made payments of operating expenses, and from which Lilyvale transferred excess amounts from time to time;
 &#8226; the procurement of [Enterprises Australia], pursuant to the Management Agreement, to operate and manage the hotel but with a veto on capital expenditure;
 &#8226; the procurement of [ANA Enterprises] (later ANA Hotels), pursuant to the Licence Agreement, to allow [Enterprises Australia] to operate and manage the hotel using the trademarks associated with ANA and the ANA Hotels Systems Services.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/42.html</AustLII>
<text>62 Whether a person is carrying on a business and the nature of that business involves a consideration of the activities in which that person is involved. In Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 , the High Court considered questions of law which raised the issue of whether the activities of the appellant amounted to "carrying on the business of grazing". The New South Wales Court of Appeal had decided, "as a matter of fact", that the appellant's use of his land, "albeit for commercial purposes and for the purpose of profit, was not significant enough to bring it within the scope of the common or general meaning of either of the words 'business' or 'industry'." Mason J, with whom Gibbs and Stephen JJ agreed, held at 8-9, that the expression, carrying on the business of grazing, denotes "grazing activities undertaken as a commercial enterprise in the nature of a going concern, that is, activities engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis". A similar approach was adopted in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 , where Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at 626:
 A business is not a thing or things. It is a course of conduct carried on for the purpose of profit and involves notions of continuity and repetition of actions.

71 The evidence shows that before the critical date Lilyvale and Enterprises Australia engaged in very different activities. It is true that Lilyvale's income (on which it was liable to income tax) was sourced from the hotel, however it was the activity of Enterprises Australia that generated that income. Lilyvale's involvement in the business of the hotel was so distant from the day to day activities of the hotel that, in my view, the course of conduct carried on in the hotel, bearing in mind the notions of continuity and repetition referred to in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Murry (see [62] above), could not be said to be the conduct of Lilyvale.

72 As mentioned above, in the pre-sale period the Management Agreement between Lilyvale and Enterprises Australia provided that Enterprises Australia would operate and manage the hotel for a period of 20 years and would also be responsible for sales and marketing. After the sale Enterprises Australia was no longer involved with the hotel, and yet the operation of the hotel continued seamlessly. It must be assumed that Lilyvale had stepped into the shoes of Enterprises Australia. To the extent that the tasks that Enterprises Australia performed before the sale, continued to be carried out after the sale, the evidence indicates that they were carried out by Lilyvale.

73 In my view the business carried on by Lilyvale in the relevant period before the share sale was not the same as the business that it carried on in the relevant period after the sale. It follows that the present application must be dismissed and the objection decision of the respondent must be affirmed. The applicant must pay the respondent's costs.
 I certify that the preceding seventy-three (73) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.

<tocase>International Harvester Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Carrigan's Hazeldene Pastoral Co [1958] HCA 16 ; (1958) 100 CLR 644</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1958/16.html</AustLII>
<text>65 This submission hinges on the legal characterisation of the relationship between Lilyvale and Enterprises Australia. It is an invitation, under the banner of 'agency', to attribute the activities of Enterprises Australia to Lilyvale to deem them to be Lilyvale's activities. The characterisation of the relationship in the Management Agreement as one of agency does not, however, lead inevitably to this conclusion. In International Harvester Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Carrigan's Hazeldene Pastoral Co [1958] HCA 16 ; (1958) 100 CLR 644 at 652 the High Court observed:
 Agency is a word used in the law to connote an authority or capacity in one person to create legal relations between a person occupying the position of principal and third parties. But in the business world its significance is by no means thus restricted. [emphasis added]</text>

<tocase>J Hammond Investments Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 31 FLR 349</tocase>
<text>68 The fact that Enterprises Australia carried out its obligations under the Management Agreement on Lilyvale's account does not mean that the 'agency' was such that its activities must be attributed to Lilyvale, nor that its business was Lilyvale's business. The question of what business Lilyvale carried on before the sale is a question of fact, the answer to which depends on the characterisation of the activities in which Lilyvale was actually engaged (i.e. what Sheppard J in J Hammond Investments Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 31 FLR 349 at 357 referred to as "the real nature of the taxpayer's business"), not on its legal relationship to Enterprises Australia and its activities.

69 I am satisfied from the evidence before me that Mr Tang's "seamless transition" was achieved; I accept that a guest in the hotel or indeed the hotel's employees, would not have discerned any material difference between the way the hotel was operated and managed before and after August 2002 until about the time when the name of the hotel was changed to the Shangri-La Hotel. The written submissions for Lilyvale summarised the applicant's evidence comparing the operation of the hotel after the sale. I accept this evidence and adopt the summary which is as follows:
 
(a) the hotel business was conducted by the Applicant under the same name;
 
(b) the same get-up and style, trademarks and presentation were used;
 
 
 (c) the management team (including in particular the general manager) continued unchanged;
 (d) the staff engaged in the conduct of the business continued unchanged except for normal turnover, which was lower in the Applicant's case than was normal in the industry;
 (e) the contracts for the provision of services by external contractors continued unchanged;
 (f) the services and facilities provided by the Applicant in the conduct of the hotel business were unchanged;
 (g) the hotel was marketed in the same way, to the same markets and using the same agents and representatives;
 (h) the signature restaurant (Unkai) and other restaurants continued to operate in the same way;
 (i) the Applicant continued to derive the (assessable) income from the provision of the same hotel services and facilities;
 (j) the same manuals and procedures continued to be used under licence from the same (ANA) group;
 (k) the same computer management and reservation systems continued to be used, obtained from the same independent suppliers;
 (l) the same reports continued to be supplied to the ultimate shareholders in the Applicant (albeit that the identity of the shareholders changed);
 (m) the owner's representative (whose identity changed from time to time) continued to perform the same role;
 (n) a "guest relationship manager" was retained to present a "Japanese face" to the hotel guests;
 (o) the management of the hotel was to the same extent (and with no greater degree of supervision) entrusted to the general manager and the executive committee; it "remained the same throughout the entire period."
 (p) in the period from the test time in August 2002 to April 2003, the Applicant undertook and achieved a "seamless transition," whereby it carried on its business in the same fashion as it had done before August 2002, such that no change resulting from the change in ownership was perceptible to its customers.

70 The same business test requires however, not merely that the same business be carried on, but that it be carried on by the taxpayer, in this case Lilyvale. I accept that after the share sale Lilyvale carried on the business of managing the hotel. The critical question remaining is whether the business that Lilyvale carried on before the share sale is properly characterised as the business of managing the hotel in the same way that the business it carried on after the share sale can be characterised.</text>

<tocase>South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd (2000) 177 ALR 611</tocase>
<text>66 In the Management Agreement the context in which the concept of agency is invoked indicates that the parties were as much concerned to exclude the possibility of their relationship being characterised as a joint venture or partnership as to invoke the concept of agency; see [9] above. There is no reason why they should not do that. As Finn J stated in South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd (2000) 177 ALR 611 at 645-646, in the course of setting out detailed propositions about the nature of agency:
 It is legitimate for parties to avoid the "unwanted consequences" of a particular category of legal relationship by seeking to cast it in a form that takes it outside that category of relationship: Colbron v St Bees Island Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 303 at 314. But whether or not they are successful in achieving that end does not depend simply upon whether, in an express provision of their agreement, they attribute or deny to their relationship a particular legal character -- be this, for example, employer and employee: Australian Mutual Provident Society v Chaplin (1978) 18 ALR 385 ; principal and principal or principal and agent: Board of Trade v Hammond Elevator Co, above; or partners: Ex parte Delhasse; Re Megevand (1878) 7 Ch D 511. The parties cannot by the mere device of labelling, no matter how genuinely intentioned, either confer a particular legal character on a relationship that it does not possess or deny it a character that it does possess: Ex parte Delhasse, above, at 532; see 2A Corpus Juris Secundum, "Agency", SS7; see also the observations of Lord Denning in Massey v Crown Life Insurance Co quoted in the Australian Mutual Provident Society case, above, at 389.</text>
