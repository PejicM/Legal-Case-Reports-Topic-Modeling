<text>16 It was put by the cross-claimant that the cross-claimant will need only to establish that the cross-respondent's conduct was "a cause" of the cross-claimant's damages: I&amp;L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109. The cross-claimant, of course, will not have to establish that the cross-respondent's conduct was the only cause. The question will be whether the contravention was a cause of the cross-claimant's loss. However, the plea as it presently stands allows the cross-respondent to say that the issue whether the cross-respondent's conduct was "a cause" has been raised and, in those circumstances, documents which might be adverse to the cross-claimant's case should be discovered.

17 For those reasons, I made the order to which I have already referred.

 I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.
