<tocase>Bidald Consulting Pty Ltd v Miles Special Builders Pty Ltd (2005) 226 ALR 510</tocase>
<text>23 Counsel for the first and second defendants has referred me to a number of authorities which recognise that the time pressures imposed by the Act in relation to administration make it inevitable that investigations and reports by administrators will be less than complete. They also support the proposition that deeds are not to be lightly set aside, stressing the need for materiality of misleading statements in the sense outlined in s 445D(1)(a)(ii) Bidald Consulting Pty Ltd v Miles Special Builders Pty Ltd (2005) 226 ALR 510 ; Khoury v Zambena Pty Ltd (1997) 23 ACSR 344 ; (1997) 15 ACLC 620 affirmed in Joseph Khoury &amp; Sons v Zambena Pty Ltd [1999] NSWCA 402 ; (1999) 217 ALR 527 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Comcorp Australia Ltd (1996) 70 FCR 356 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Pddam Pty Ltd (1996) 19 ACSR 498 ; (1996) 14 ACLC 659 ; and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Portinex Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 99 ; (2000) 156 FLR 453; (2000) 34 ACSR 391.</text>

<tocase>KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410</tocase>

<text>14 In relation to the absence of the lawyer's certificate, it is said that that is of no remaining significance as the cross-claim was filed by a solicitor on behalf of Meribal, thus, carrying with it the same assurance. Such a serious misstatement can hardly be swept aside in that fashion but, in any event, there is no explanation as to how, on the basis of the normal solicitor's assurance, a claim could be valued fully without discount to reflect the chances of failure and for costs ( KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410). Counsel for Vatera points out that the only particularised claim at that time was $270,000.

15 In addition to the difficulties with the report, the DOCA is in an unsatisfactory form. It appears to be a boilerplate that is not well adapted for the particular proposal plus a home grown addition. The result is not acceptable. Upon execution of the DOCA, control of Meribal (including its assets and business) reverted to the director (cl 8.1). Trading is not prohibited. Meribal and the directors undertook to pay all taxes and statutory obligations due for payment by the company thereafter. There is no committee of creditors. There is a moratorium during the term of the DOCA in relation to any action by a creditor. A creditor is any person having a claim against Meribal whose claim is admitted by the Administrators. The Corporations Act procedures for making claims to liquidators are incorporated by reference. The DOCA bars creditors who do not prove.

16 The boilerplate clause concerning priority of distributions is as follows:</text>
