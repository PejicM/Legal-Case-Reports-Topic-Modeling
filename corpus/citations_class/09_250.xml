ASIC then submits that when the proceeding reaches the stage that an informed assessment can be made of whether any defendants would be prejudiced by a joint trial, other measures may be sufficient to avoid that prejudice. For example, ASIC says it has become commonplace in large and complex proceedings for trials to be staged in such a manner as to make it unnecessary for all parties to attend at all stages of the trial: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville [2008] NSWSC 788 at [48] [50], [57]; Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at [70]; Main-Road Property Group Pty Ltd v Pelligra &amp; Sons Pty Ltd at [25]; Jendas Pty Ltd v Jolly [1997] 2 VR 106 at 107. In Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville , Austin J observed that ASIC could, with the Court's encouragement, conduct its case in such a way that the days upon which the eighth defendant in that matter would need to be represented in court would be limited. Cost, delay and the efficient use of the resources of the parties and the Court

The various factors which led Austin J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to recently allow a joinder of defendants by ASIC in Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville are absent in the matter.

There, Austin J, granted ASIC leave to join ten defendants in the one action. The first defendant was a Mr Somerville. The second defendant was the incorporated legal practice of which Mr Somerville had become a legal practitioner director. ASIC had contended that Mr Somerville had provided legal advice as a solicitor to each of the eight director defendants to the effect that they should sell the business or assets of a certain company to another purchaser company which each would control. The liability of Mr Somerville and his incorporated legal practice would only have arisen if contraventions by one or more of the other defendants were proved. It was the common participation of Mr Somerville as legal adviser that linked the transactions. Accordingly and most importantly, the cases against each of the eight director defendants were components of ASIC's case against Mr Somerville and his incorporated law firm for involvement in the contraventions by each director. It was, as his Honour found, an important part of ASIC's evidentiary case against Mr Somerville and his incorporated legal practice to show that, in respect of the eight transactions, there was a pattern and similarity devised by Mr Somerville [37]. Accordingly, ASIC and Mr Somerville were common parties to all claims. There was considered to be a likely saving of costs to ASIC and Mr Somerville by one proceeding, constituted with all ten defendants, going to trial. There was likely to have been a very substantial repetition of evidence should there have been a separation of the case against one of the defendants as Mr Somerville would have had to give evidence in the trial of that case as well as the case against the balance of the defendants. It was, accordingly, concluded that as a primary factor in refusing a separation order that the benefits to ASIC and Mr Somerville of a single proceeding in which the evidence of his involvement in the eight transactions was received once and for all was considered as of great significance.

In this case, however, the common thread passing through the cases against each of the corporate defendants and indeed the personal defendants is that each of these cases concerns transactions involving Firepower BVI shares. There is, otherwise, no relationship between the corporate defendants nor any between Sattvic and either Mr Ward or Mr Johnston, the sixth and seventh defendants respectively.

I am satisfied that it would be inconvenient to Mr Stein, particularly professionally, for the case against him to be tried together with the cases against the other defendants. More importantly, given the already adverse effect of these proceedings upon his reputation I think that the inevitable delay of a trial as against his company, Sattvic, would of itself render an injustice to him. I would expect such delay to be considerable in the circumstances.

In my opinion, for these reasons, the motion should be granted with costs. I will invite the parties to bring in a minute of order reflecting these reasons. 
 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.

<tocase>Bishop v Bridgelands Securities (1990) 25 FCR 311</tocase>
<text>The relevant principles are not controversial. The basic principle, which ought to guide the exercise of discretion, is that "the Court should take whatever course seems to be most conducive to a just resolution of the disputes between the parties, but having regard to the desirability of limiting, so far as practicable, the costs and delay of the litigation": Bishop v Bridgelands Securities (1990) 25 FCR 311 at 314. This case involved an application for joinder of additional applicants, which raises similar considerations to the present one.

ASIC submits that the following factors are also relevant: 
 (a) the state of progression of the proceeding: Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd (No 2) at [25]. 

 
 (b) the degree to which cost and delay will be minimised by a single trial or by separate trials: Bishop v Bridgelands Securities Ltd at 314; 

 
 (c) the efficient use of the resources of the parties and the court: Carter v Commissioner of Taxation at [23]; Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at [34]; 

 
 (d) that it is preferable from a public policy perspective to avoid a multiplicity of hearings: Main-Road Property Group Pty Ltd v Pelligra &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 43 at [21] ; 

 
 (e) any relevant public interest in the proceeding: Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at [35]; and 

 
 (f) the degree of similarity in the transactions alleged in the proceedings this may be a more weighty consideration than the somewhat technical point that the transactions do not form a series: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville [2008] NSWSC 788 at [42] .

ASIC then submits that when the proceeding reaches the stage that an informed assessment can be made of whether any defendants would be prejudiced by a joint trial, other measures may be sufficient to avoid that prejudice. For example, ASIC says it has become commonplace in large and complex proceedings for trials to be staged in such a manner as to make it unnecessary for all parties to attend at all stages of the trial: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville [2008] NSWSC 788 at [48] [50], [57]; Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at [70]; Main-Road Property Group Pty Ltd v Pelligra &amp; Sons Pty Ltd at [25]; Jendas Pty Ltd v Jolly [1997] 2 VR 106 at 107. In Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Somerville , Austin J observed that ASIC could, with the Court's encouragement, conduct its case in such a way that the days upon which the eighth defendant in that matter would need to be represented in court would be limited. Cost, delay and the efficient use of the resources of the parties and the Court

ASIC submits that it is in the public interest for a regulatory authority such as ASIC to be able to seek public relief in the most expeditious and cost effective way possible: by analogy, Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Ltd at 74, where Austin J considered the public interest in a liquidator being able to recover unfair preferences expeditiously to be relevant. As I have said, I am not persuaded that a joint trial involving Sattvic is necessarily the most expeditious and cost effective way of disposing of this litigation. In any event, any possible public interest must be balanced against the legitimate private interests of Sattvic. Common Questions and Similar Issues

ASIC submits that there are similarities between the way the share application form was used in the course of three of the offers alleged against Sattvic (at paras 212A to 212O of the plaintiff's amended statement of claim) and the way those forms were used in respect of certain offers alleged to have been made by other defendants (at paras 84-89, 160-164, 173-177 and 184-194 of the statement of claim). It then submits, without specificity, that much of the evidence and submissions on these issues are likely to be the same or substantially similar in respect of all defendants. I have considered the pleadings. In the end, as I have identified above, the issues for trial between ASIC and Sattvic are very limited. There is little or no dispute about factual matters which are substantially similar in the actions against the other defendants.

In addition, ASIC submits that common questions of statutory interpretation affecting important provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) are likely to arise in respect of all defendants, in particular s 707(3) and (4). It says that the purpose test in s 707(4) is relied on against all defendants and there will be common questions concerning the application of that test affecting all defendants. However, there is no live issue as to this between Sattvic and ASIC as the contentions of ASIC in this respect are admitted. Accordingly, no question of inconsistent judgments on this question arises.</text>

<tocase>Meadow Gem Pty Ltd v ANZ Executors and Trustees (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, 8 May 1995)</tocase>
<text>In support of its contention that the evidence concerning the claims against it will be unique, Sattvic has filed an affidavit from one of the two persons it has identified as likely witnesses it will call at trial. As to this ASIC submits that it is necessary to bear in mind that the evidence when called may reveal overlap and connection not presently capable of being detected: Meadow Gem Pty Ltd v ANZ Executors and Trustees (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, 8 May 1995) at 14. For example, it says, evidence from the seventh defendant, Mr Johnston, may bear on the question of the date of issue of shares to Sattvic which is raised in paragraph 2 of Sattvic's defence. As before these submissions are speculative. If there were indeed the real likelihood of overlap it would by now be evident. In any event, even if there were some limited overlap of the kind described I do not regard that, of itself, as a basis for declining the order sought.</text>
