<text>9 In relation to the first alleged ground of jurisdictional error, the appellant invoked generally the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, and in particular what was said by the High Court at [68] (McHugh J), and thereafter in the reasons for judgment of a Full Federal Court in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214, and in particular what was emphasised by Allsop J at [216]. However the appellant did not invoke specifically or with precision the operation of the process required by s 424A(1) in the circumstances of this case, assuming that any such course was open for adoption. In that regard as Allsop J emphasised in the passage above cited, '[o]ne always needs to analyse and interpret the reasons of the Tribunal in order to understand the reason for the ultimate reason or conclusion of the lack of satisfaction of the existence of protection obligations', and further that '[t]he whole of the written reasons must be analysed and interpreted in their context to assess why it was that the Tribunal acted as it did...' . Those tasks were not undertaken by the appellant on the present appeal with precision or at all.</text>
