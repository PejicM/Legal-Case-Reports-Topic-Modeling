<text>The fact that the appellant had not satisfied the points test in each criterion in a decision which is set aside would be a matter that the Tribunal could take into account, if it had to complete its review, although it would be able to review the question afresh, as Gummow and Hayne JJ pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518. Indeed, in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 222 ALR 411 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ held that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error where the tribunal had reached a decision to refuse a visa to an applicant and had said that it had given no weight to a confidential letter. The visa applicant was ignorant of the existence of the letter which contained credible, relevant and significant material which was adverse to the visa applicant. Their Honours said: 
 
 'It follows that asking whether, despite what was said in its reasons, the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry. The relevant inquiry is: what procedures should have been followed? The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision-maker have made, nor what reasons did the decision-maker give for the conclusion reached.' (222 ALR at 417 [19])</text>

<text>In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 627 [44] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, 656-657 [144]-[147] per Gummow J, 672-673 [194] per Callinan J, the distinction between a decision which the court finds no reasonable decision-maker could have come to and one which the court considers simply to be unreasonable, was discussed. The latter characterization involves a broad spectrum at the extreme end of which may be found decisions of the former category in the sense of unreasonableness of the kind recognized in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 230. The existence of that spectrum reminds the courts that between its extreme ends are many categories of decision with which courts might not agree or which they could regard as unreasonable but which a reasonable person could have made. The latter category of decision is immunized from judicial review because the legislature has confided to the decision-maker the task of forming the opinion or arriving at the state of satisfaction on the materials before him or her.</text>

<text>In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 42 Mason J noted that the Court should proceed with caution in cases where it was suggested that a decision-maker had erred by giving too much or too little weight to particular considerations '... lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on its merits'. He said that a close analogy existed between the judicial review of administrative action and appellate review of a judicial discretion. He pointed to the fact that in cases of the latter kind appellate courts could review discretionary judgments that had failed to give proper weight to a particular matter, but were slow to do so because the mere preference for a different result was not sufficient to disturb the exercise of the discretion by the judge at first instance (162 CLR at 42).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1951/5.html</AustLII>
<text>When a court exercising its power to review an administrative decision concludes that, in accordance with the above principles, the decision is 'unreasonable' its conclusion must be a finding that in truth the power conferred by the statute has not been exercised and so a jurisdictional error has occurred. This a feature of the rule of law which forms a fundamental assumption upon which the Constitution is based: Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 193 per Dixon J; Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 513-514 [103] - [104] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. The recognition by the Parliament, in statutory provisions like ss 368 and 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), that administrative decision-makers should give reasons for their decision and set out their findings, is a reminder to administrative decision-makers of an important aspect of the rule of law: namely, that they must provide the justification, in the reasons required by the statute to be given, for the exercise of the power with which they have been entrusted. And, the requirement to provide reasons is a means of ensuring that courts, when exercising the power of judicial review, are not obliged to approach their consideration of the exercise of the discretion in the same speculative way as in a case like Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360.</text>

<text>Indeed, in Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360, Dixon J said, in a case where the Commissioner was not required to give reasons, that: 
 
 'The conclusion that he has reached may, on a full consideration of the material that was before him, be found to be capable of explanation only on the ground of some such misconception. If the result appears to be unreasonable on the supposition that he addressed himself to the right question, correctly applied the rules of law and took into account all the relevant considerations and no irrelevant considerations, then it may be a proper inference that it is a false supposition. It is not necessary that you should be sure of the precise particular in which he has gone wrong. It is enough that you can see that in some way he must have failed in the discharge of his exact function according to law.'

When a court exercising its power to review an administrative decision concludes that, in accordance with the above principles, the decision is 'unreasonable' its conclusion must be a finding that in truth the power conferred by the statute has not been exercised and so a jurisdictional error has occurred. This a feature of the rule of law which forms a fundamental assumption upon which the Constitution is based: Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 193 per Dixon J; Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 513-514 [103] - [104] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.

<text>After I had begun delivering lengthy ex tempore reasons at the conclusion of the hearing, I formed the opinion that I was not able to decide the appeal without further assistance. Accordingly, I reserved my decision. I withdraw any oral reasons. As I have noted above, I was then of the view that the Tribunal had made two jurisdictional errors, one in respect of cl 845.216, the other in respect of the appellant's English language. In that context I directed the parties to make any further submissions about whether the grant of relief would be futile because, even if the language issue were revisited the appellant had no realistic prospect of obtaining the 20 extra points he needed: cf: Kumaraperu v Minister for Immigration (1998) 88 FCR 381 at 396G per Weinberg J and Peng v Minister for Immigration [2000] FCA 1672 ; (2000) 105 FCR 63 at 67 [14] per Hely J.</text>

<tocase>Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/168.html</AustLII>
<text>Although the particular document containing the policy was not part of the appeal papers or before the trial judge, during the course of argument before me, two documents were produced. One was headed 'About Visa 485' and I was informed by counsel for the Minister that its provisions applied as the policy at the time at which the appellant made his original application for a visa. Unhelpfully, it did not set out criteria for the purposes of assessing whether cl 845.216, should be interpreted in any particular way, but, simply referred to another policy for those criteria. The policy in effect for the period 11 May 2005 to 15 June 2005, being the period in which the Tribunal's decision was given, was also produced. It set out, in par 8.1, criteria, for the purposes of cl 845.216, materially identical to those the subject of consideration by a Full Court of this Court in Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 101-102 [30] .

The terms of par 8.1 of the policy were: 
 
 
 '8.1 The policy intention of this criterion overall is to establish whether the applicant has the ability to manage and operate a main business successfully. 
 
 Under policy, it requires [sic] the applicant to demonstrate that 
 
 
 
 
 
 . they have exercised responsibility within the main business(es) in terms of decision-making authority, responsibility for employees and/or responsibility for expenditure; 
 
 . such responsibility has been exercised on a continuous (as opposed to on an occasional basis); and 
 
 . their skills have been fundamental to, or have exerted direct influence on, the operation of the main business(es). 
 
 
 
 
 
 The success (or otherwise) of the business(es) is not a relevant factor in assessing this criterion. Rather, if an applicant satisfies this criterion in respect of a failed or declining business, this should be considered in assessing whether the applicant "has overall had a successful business career".'

The Full Court held, following a concession by the Minister, that the requirements of the identically worded policy did not correspond to the requirements of the Regulations. The court said (132 FCR at 112 [63]) that: 
 
 '... the departmental policy ... was narrower than the criterion for a subclass 845 visa set out in cl 845.216 .... The criterion requires satisfaction on the part of the Minister that the applicant for the visa as owner of and interested in a main business "maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business or in those businesses from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business or those businesses." This did not import a requirement that could only be satisfied by demonstrating the exercise of responsibility within the business in terms of decision-making authority, responsibility for employees, and/or responsibility for expenditure. There is a variety of ways in which a person might maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of a business and in making decisions affecting its overall direction and performance.' (emphasis added)

The trial judge adopted the submission of the Minister that the Tribunal's approach to this issue was not a misconstruction of the requirements of a statutory criterion for the granting of a visa by applying a policy which was narrower than the criterion in cl 845.216, in contrast to Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93. Rather, his Honour, in adopting the Minister's submission, found that it was clear from the Tribunal's decision that it had applied the very words of the enactment (in the passages at [30]-[33] to which I have referred) and that the case was no more than a merits review, as opposed to an error going to jurisdiction.

I do not agree. The Tribunal's obligation was to conduct a review of the decision of the delegate (s 348(1)). In performing that review it had power to exercise all of the powers and discretions that were conferred by the Act on the person who made the decision (s 349). And, having made a decision, the Tribunal was obliged to prepare a written statement under s 368(1) which set out: 
 
 
 &#8226; the decision of the Tribunal on review;
 &#8226; its reasons for that decision;
 &#8226; the findings on any material questions of fact; and
 &#8226; references to the evidence or any other material on which those findings of fact were based.

I am of opinion that the Tribunal did not, in its reasons for decision, set out the evidence or any other material on which the ultimate findings of fact to which it came in relation to cl 845.216 were based. There was nothing in the findings or other material set out in its reasons that enabled it to come to the conclusion that it could not be satisfied on the issue of the appellant's involvement in the business.

The Tribunal expressly said that it had considered policy in arriving at its lack of satisfaction that the appellant had met the criteria of cl 845.216. Here, the Tribunal appears to have been misled by its reliance on the unlawful constriction which par 8.1 of the policy sought to put on the proper interpretation of cl 845.216 as held in Lobo v Minister [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93. As their Honours held, a want of satisfaction of the criteria set out in the policy would not equate to a want of satisfaction of the criterion in cl 845.216. And an assessment by the Tribunal in which, as it said, it was required to have regard to that policy and apply it unless there were cogent reasons for departing from it, involves jurisdictional error because the Tribunal applied the policy rather than the criteria in cl 845.216 (132 FCR at 112 [63]-[69].

The Tribunal made an error of law in that it did not correctly understand and apply the criteria in cl 845.216. Nor did it give any reasons for its conclusion in that regard. Each was a failure to conduct that part of the review in accordance with law, being a requirement to decide whether or not the appellant met the criteria for cl 845.216. And, this was also a jurisdictional error ( Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 132 FCR at 112 [64]-[65]).

The second argument related to whether or not the appellant met the requirements of Pt 3 of Schedule 7 of the Regulations for the purposes of cl 845.222(1). Under that clause a notice in the Gazette can establish the number of points required for the 'business skills points test' to be satisfied. The notice, for present purposes, required 105 points. It is not in issue that the appellant was entitled to 10 points by reason if his age (being between 50 and 55 years) and was entitled to 60 points because the business with which he was involved, in the 12 months immediately preceding the making of his application, met the criteria specified (in Div 1.4 of Schedule 7 in cl 7170). Accordingly, he had 70 points from those two criteria. He needed another 35 points to satisfy the test in the notice in the Gazette.

The Tribunal assessed appellant as being of limited ability in English and gave him 10 points for that item. It then found that it was not satisfied with the estimates of value which the appellant had given for his assets and was not satisfied he had net assets of more than $1.5 million at the hearing, but was satisfied of him having at least $500,000 worth. Accordingly it gave him 5 points for that item. He was thus 20 points short of what he needed to meet the points test.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/11.html</AustLII>
<text>This raises a tension between a consideration of the way in which a court must assess the impact of a jurisdictional error that is found and its bearing on the overall decision. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at 541-542 [74] Gummow and Hayne JJ said that: 
 
 '... to attempt to divorce the Tribunal's statement of its findings on what it considered to be a material question of fact, from the decision it made and, in particular, from its reasons, may be dangerous in cases like the present where it is accepted that the Tribunal made an error of law. There are several reasons why it may be a dangerous process. First, there is the notorious difficulty of disentangling findings of fact from conclusions about applicable legal principle. Secondly, assuming that those difficulties can be surmounted, the findings of fact which the Tribunal makes after hearing and assessing the body of material and submissions will necessarily reflect the Tribunal's conclusions about applicable legal principle and will be directed to the questions that those principles present.' 
 

Their Honours went on to say:
 
 'If, in that review, the Tribunal makes an error of law and a subsequent review is ordered, what is the Tribunal then to do if the further findings are to be made about subjects with which the first Tribunal dealt? For it to take, as its starting point, findings that were made on that earlier review under a misapprehension of applicable legal principles, may, indeed often would, skew the second factual inquiry by the Tribunal.'

Their Honours then noted that by contrast, if no more findings needed to be made on the second review because only one conclusion was lawfully open to the Tribunal on the findings that it made at the first, the difficulties to which they had referred would be much reduced, if not eliminated.

The Tribunal's function here, as the Minister pointed out, involved consideration of the situation at two points of time for certain matters. Under cll 845.21 and 845.221 some criteria, such as those under cl 845.216, had to be satisfied at the times of both the application and the decision. Additionally, under cl 845.22 further criteria had to be satisfied at the time of the decision. Under cl 845.222(2)(b)(ii) the appellant's score on the business skills points test is calculated as the sum of his scores, for present purposes, at the time when the application for the visa was made. Under cl 845.222(2)(c) certain assets only are to be valued or assessed for value in determining whether an applicant meets the points criteria under Pt 4 of Schedule 7 of the Regulations (see items 7401-7404).

I am of opinion that when a matter is remitted (under Div 4 Pt 5 of the Act) to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law, similar reasoning applies. The way in which that review is undertaken is similar to the task of the Refugee Review Tribunal in like circumstances see: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 (see esp at [35]-[36]).

The fact that the appellant had not satisfied the points test in each criterion in a decision which is set aside would be a matter that the Tribunal could take into account, if it had to complete its review, although it would be able to review the question afresh, as Gummow and Hayne JJ pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518. Indeed, in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 222 ALR 411 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ held that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error where the tribunal had reached a decision to refuse a visa to an applicant and had said that it had given no weight to a confidential letter. The visa applicant was ignorant of the existence of the letter which contained credible, relevant and significant material which was adverse to the visa applicant. Their Honours said: 
 
 'It follows that asking whether, despite what was said in its reasons, the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry. The relevant inquiry is: what procedures should have been followed? The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision-maker have made, nor what reasons did the decision-maker give for the conclusion reached.' (222 ALR at 417 [19])</text>

In Minister for Immigration v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 20 [38] Gummow and Hayne JJ said that:

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/17.html</AustLII>
<text>Administrative decision-making, of its nature, involves the formation of value judgments as to such matters as credibility, the strength or compellingness of the particular case, the importance of consistency in decision-making and the simple formation of the relevant opinion which the statute prescribes as the occasion for the exercise of the power. Thus, s 65 of the Act requires the Minister, as the decision-maker, to be satisfied of particular matters if she is to grant a visa. Value judgments are ones in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, no particular opinion being uniquely right: cp Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518 per Mason and Deane JJ; 540-541 per Brennan J; see too at 535 per Wilson and Dawson JJ. As Brennan J said, there is no difference in principle between the review of a judicial discretion and the review of an administrative discretion (161 CLR at 540). He pointed out that if a discretionary power were exercised in a way which a reasonable repository of the power might exercise it, that exercise of power is supported by the statute which conferred it, whether the discretion be judicial or administrative in nature.

Brennan J went on to point out that appellate courts were more familiar with the usual confines within which judicial discretions might be exercised and were therefore more sensitive to an unreasonable exercise of such a discretion and more confident of their ability to detect error in its exercise. He said: 
 
 'It is harder to be satisfied that an administrative body has acted unreasonably, particularly when the administrative discretion is wide in its scope or is affected by policies of which the court has no experience.' (161 CLR at 541)</text>

This a feature of the rule of law which forms a fundamental assumption upon which the Constitution is based: Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth [1951] HCA 5 ; (1951) 83 CLR 1 at 193 per Dixon J; Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 513-514 [103] - [104] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. The recognition by the Parliament, in statutory provisions like ss 368 and 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), that administrative decision-makers should give reasons for their decision and set out their findings, is a reminder to administrative decision-makers of an important aspect of the rule of law: namely, that they must provide the justification, in the reasons required by the statute to be given, for the exercise of the power with which they have been entrusted. And, the requirement to provide reasons is a means of ensuring that courts, when exercising the power of judicial review, are not obliged to approach their consideration of the exercise of the discretion in the same speculative way as in a case like Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360.

At the very least the Tribunal's conclusion that it was not satisfied that the appellant had met the criteria in cl 845.216 ensured that he could not be granted the visa because s 65(1) so provided. The Tribunal was required to conduct its review according to law. And a failure to do so is a failure to follow the requirements which the Tribunal had to follow in order to come to a decision that could be valid. The Tribunal had an imperative duty to consider the criteria which the Act and Regulations prescribed and to form a view on those criteria for the purposes of conducting its review: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] . It did not do so and committed a jurisdictional error for the reasons I have given.</text>

<text>The inadequacy of the material relied on by an administrative decision-maker while, not itself, being a ground for prohibition is a circumstance which may support, in a case like the present, the inference that the Tribunal was applying the wrong test or was not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters. As Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ held in R v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120: 
 
 'If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact.'</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/1.html</AustLII>
<text>The Minister relied on remarks of McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 (and in particular I apprehend at 412-413 [35]-[36] and 416-418 [60]-[70]) that in effect the Tribunal in stating its reasons for decision was entitled to make findings of fact and was not required to go through line by line each item of evidence, or each relevant matter and deal with it in turn, accepting or dismissing it. So much may be accepted.

The Minister also argued that the decision required under s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') was whether or not the Tribunal, standing in the shoes of the Minister as the decision-maker, was satisfied of the matters set out in the Regulations for the purposes of granting the visa for which the appellant applied. She contended that findings along the way were not ones which went to jurisdiction.

I am of opinion that it was not open to the Tribunal, on the basis only of the findings it set out, to find that a person in a single business that consists of running one retail trading shop who makes decisions daily about placing orders and pricing of goods offered for sale, and had done so for over one year prior to his application without any suggestion of supervision or control, did not have direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business from day to day or in making decisions that affect the overall direction and performance of that business. The Tribunal did not express any finding or reason for that ultimate conclusion, except that it did not find the evidence compelling.

As McHugh J pointed out, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at 417 [70] the requirements of s 368 are that the Tribunal give a written but not lengthy explanation of the decision already made.

I am of opinion that there was an absence of any reason, factual finding or reference to facts expressed in the Tribunal's reasons that could show that a person who had the duties and performed the functions of the appellant in the business during the period which the Tribunal was considering, namely the year prior to his visa application being lodged, did not satisfy the criteria of cl 845.216.

Having regard to the Tribunal's expressed findings and reasons, its decision on this issue was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to it on the basis expressed in those findings and reasons. That is not to say that another tribunal could not come to the same decision, but if it did so it would have to apply the law correctly, make findings and give reasons which were capable of supporting the decision.

I can see no error of approach in the way that the Tribunal dealt with this matter. It was entitled to form a view as to whether or not what had been put to it by the appellant satisfied it as to the value of his assets. This was, as McHugh J said in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Durairajasingham ((2000) 74 ALJR at 417 [67]) a finding on, inter alia, credibility or establishment of facts which was the function of a primary decision-maker par excellence. I do not consider that the Tribunal has been shown to have erred or not performed its function of review of the application in this respect.

The question arises of how the matter ought then be resolved.

The Minister has raised an issue of some difficulty. She says that the Tribunal may have erred in the way in which I have found, but that nonetheless even if one accepts that result, the application would be rejected on reconsideration by the Tribunal. That is because, even if the Tribunal formed a more favourable view on, first, the issue under cl 845.216 and then, secondly, on the language issue and awarded the appellant 10 more points, he would still be 10 points short of the 105 required to satisfy the points.</text>

<text>And, in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 67 [36]-[37], McHugh and Gummow JJ, having applied the passage just cited said that the particular circumstances disclosed by the written statement required by s 430 (here s 368) of the Act was important in this regard (see too at 198 ALR at 71 [52], 98 [173] per Callinan J agreeing). In Minister for Immigration v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 20 [38] Gummow and Hayne JJ said that: 
 
 '...the critical question is whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant 20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 67 [37], 71 [52], 98 [173]). If the decision did display these defects, it will be no answer that the determination was reached in good faith ... However, inadequacy of the material before the decision-maker concerning the attainment of that satisfaction is insufficient in itself to establish jurisdictional error.'</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at 183-184 [80] , 211-212 [210]-[211] McHugh and Hayne JJ respectively considered whether and to what extent the court could withhold relief in cases where the jurisdictional error had been established. The decision to issue to constitutional writs or a writ of certiorari is, of course, discretionary. McHugh J pointed out, as the Minister put in her submissions, that discretionary relief may be refused if an applicant has in fact suffered no injustice because, for example, the statutory regime compelled a particular outcome (215 ALR at 184 [80]).

I am of opinion that there was some relationship between the Tribunal's findings about the appellant's degree of involvement in the business and his language skills. In particular the Tribunal referred to the difficulties he had in the interview with the Department, which was conducted without an interpreter, in considering both the issues under cl 845.216 and the language component of the points test. The Tribunal found that the appellant did not demonstrate to it that he understood and spoke English at a level which would have allowed him to understand questions in English, and therefore accepted that he had difficulties in understanding questions asked of him at the Departmental interview . As the trial judge observed '... the issue was not dealt with as clearly as one might like' in the reasons of the Tribunal even though there was no jurisdictional error established on this point.

In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at 212 [211] Hayne J, with whom Kirby J agreed, referred with approval to what Gaudron J had said in Enfield City Corporation v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at 157 [56] that: 
 
 '... the courts should provide whatever remedies are available and appropriate to ensure that those possessed of executive and administrative powers exercise them only in accordance with the laws which govern their exercise. The rule of law requires no less.'

The Minister does not rely on any delay, waiver or acquiescence or other conduct disentitling the appellant to relief. The sole question is whether the finding by the Tribunal that the appellant had not satisfied it as to the points test is such as mandates that any reconsideration by the Tribunal must result in the same ultimate decision to affirm the decision not to grant the visa.

I am of opinion that the Tribunal's findings on the points test issues are part of the merits which it can revisit or not as it sees appropriate, if it is ordered to conduct the review according to law. It would be for the Tribunal to make its own decision as to whether or not it was satisfied as to any such matters on a review, albeit that it may well feel that it does not wish to revisit the matter. Alternatively, it may feel that, having regard to the jurisdictional error that has been found, it ought to do so. The Court cannot compel the Tribunal to adhere in the future to any particular state of satisfaction which it expressed previously in its reasons.

I am not satisfied that the appellant has suffered no injustice ( SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 215 ALR at 184 [80], 203 [170], 212 [211]) having regard to the jurisdictional error I have found and to the fact that on reconsideration he may be able to satisfy the Tribunal conducting the review in accordance with law of the matters which it had previously not been satisfied about under the points test. I am not confident that the jurisdictional error I have found could have had no bearing on the outcome and thus I should not refuse relief: Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145, 147.</text>

<text>The question of how the review, if one is ordered, is to be further conducted, would be a matter for a member constituting the Tribunal for the purposes of that review. In a similar context, a Full Court of this court recently considered, when a matter was remitted by the court, what the Refugee Review Tribunal was required to do when further conducting the review, and whether it was obliged to start afresh or was entitled to take account of what had already been looked at by the Tribunal, differently constituted on the earlier occasion, whose decision had been set aside by a consent order made by the court: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107.

I am of opinion that when a matter is remitted (under Div 4 Pt 5 of the Act) to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law, similar reasoning applies. The way in which that review is undertaken is similar to the task of the Refugee Review Tribunal in like circumstances see: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 (see esp at [35]-[36]).</text>
