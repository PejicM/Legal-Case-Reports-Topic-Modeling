<text>53 The public and private importance of the change of status in making a party bankrupt is too well known to require detailed citation. It is not a matter merely between debtor and creditor. It affects creditors generally and the public. The bankrupt, while bankrupt, has his or her status changed. Conduct which might otherwise be innocent may become punishable at law. There remains a stigma to the person, often as a mark of failure in life, sometimes of a particularly humiliating character. Though in a dissenting judgment, the seriousness of the matter was luminously expressed by Deane J in Kleinwort Benson Australia Pty Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1999) 165 CLR 71 at 82. The public and private interest in discharge or annulment can be seen in many cases such as Re Barton (1980) 43 FLR 245, Re Stainton; Ex parte Board of Trade (1887) 19 QBD 182, Re Haines (1937) 10 ABC 83, Re Gray (1960) 19 ABC 29 and Re Prince (1961) 19 ABC 39 and see also Ex parte Selby; in the matter of Selby and Norton (1855) 43 ER 1437 per Lord Justice Knight-Bruce.</text>

<tocase>Oates v Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 27 FCR 289</tocase>
<text>55 It goes without saying that the procedures required should be viewed from the perspective of the interests of all creditors. In a given case, which is not this one, a Court might look very carefully at any procedure leading to a composition dominated by creditors related to the bankrupt or reflecting a lack of commercial morality or sharp practice. Parliament, however, has chosen to provide in s 74(5) for the annulment and thus for the consequences that flow therefrom: Oates v Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 27 FCR 289 , Re Coyle (1993) 42 FCR 72 , Theissbacher v MacGregor Garrick &amp; Co [1993] 2 Qd R 223, Pascoe; in the matter of Hudson [2005] FCA 1421 , Worrall v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 51 FCR 304 and Union Club v Battenberg [2006] NSWCA 72 ; (2006) 66 NSWLR 1.</text>

<text>52 The applicants emphasise the expression used by Sheppard J in Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1983) 69 FLR 424 at 431 when his Honour used the expression "great power" of the trustee in bankruptcy in preventing a discharge from bankruptcy occurring by entering an objection to discharge. That expression was used by the Full Court in Prentice v Wood [2002] FCA 214 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296 at 300 in discussing the power in s 149C(1)(c). I do not find those expressions of any particular assistance in construing ss 73 and 74 and in ascertaining the statutory consequence of any failure to comply (if that occurred) with ss 73 and 74 .</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>57 These considerations go not only to the construction and interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act , but also to assess the consequences of any breach of that which the statute provides for: Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355. When a statute provides for compliance with procedures laid down therein, the consequences of an absence of such compliance upon acts performed pursuant thereto must be assessed. Those procedures, if breached in some aspect, must be examined in their context in order that the Court can understand what Parliament intended to be the consequences of such breach.

58 The question whether information put forward by the bankrupts is sufficient in detail and underlying commercial substance to amount to a proposal will generally be a judgmental decision for the trustee. It may arise at the point of refusal by the trustee to convene a meeting on the basis that there is insufficient reliable material to allow her or him to give an opinion for the purposes of s 73(2A). It may arise at the point of someone seeking to restrain a meeting on the basis that what is being put is not a proposal. In those cases, a substantial question that will arise will be whether there is a proposal of sufficient clarity and reality to permit a judgment of the trustee under s 73(2A).

59 Here, the trustee took the view that there was a proposal. An opinion purporting to be under s 73(2A) was given. Voting took place. The issues are whether there was a proposal and whether the trustee gave an opinion for the purposes of s 73(2A) and if not, whether that made the resolutions, the meeting, the composition and the annulments nullities.

71 Here Mr Thomas took the view that, though there were certain inadequacies in the proposal, it was a proposal. I do not think he was wrong in that. However, even if he were, he decided to take it to the creditors and what followed has been set out above. As I have said in relation to my views on Project Blue Sky [1998] HCA 28 ; 194 CLR 355, even if the first proposal was not a proposal and even if he could not have been forced to take it to a meeting, I do not think that has the consequence of invalidating everything that followed. As I said, I think it was a proposal in that there was an arrangement capable of being accepted, whether or not its implementation was certain I think more went to its attractiveness than as to whether it was a proposal. There was no time expressed for implementation. The law will always imply a reasonable time. Again, if I am wrong and that was such as to make it not a proposal, Mr Thomas' view that it was and that it should go to the meeting was not a failure of procedure which nullifies all that flows thereafter.</text>

<tocase>Re Barton (1980) 43 FLR 245</tocase>
<text>53 The public and private importance of the change of status in making a party bankrupt is too well known to require detailed citation. It is not a matter merely between debtor and creditor. It affects creditors generally and the public. The bankrupt, while bankrupt, has his or her status changed. Conduct which might otherwise be innocent may become punishable at law. There remains a stigma to the person, often as a mark of failure in life, sometimes of a particularly humiliating character. Though in a dissenting judgment, the seriousness of the matter was luminously expressed by Deane J in Kleinwort Benson Australia Pty Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1999) 165 CLR 71 at 82. The public and private interest in discharge or annulment can be seen in many cases such as Re Barton (1980) 43 FLR 245, Re Stainton; Ex parte Board of Trade (1887) 19 QBD 182, Re Haines (1937) 10 ABC 83, Re Gray (1960) 19 ABC 29 and Re Prince (1961) 19 ABC 39 and see also Ex parte Selby; in the matter of Selby and Norton (1855) 43 ER 1437 per Lord Justice Knight-Bruce.

56 Relevant also, in addition to the interests of the parties, is the interest of the public, as I have said, in a discharge context: see in particular Re Barton 43 FLR 245. The important changes, retrospectively, to the status of the former bankrupt brought about by annulment and the operation of s 74(5) , with the consequential permission of the erstwhile bankrupt to move about the community with full status, also inform the need to construe the provisions with an eye to substance over formality and not subvert the intended practical freedom sought to be given to the bankrupt by procedural issues not affecting in any given case the substance of the legitimacy of the expression of the creditors' views.</text>

<tocase>Re Bendel; Ex parte Bendel v Pattison (1997) 80 FCR 123 </tocase>
<text>72 It is said that the trustee did not provide an opinion of the purposes of s 73(2A) because the trustee only said that it would appear that both alternatives (that is the McGurk contract and the first Naylor proposal) benefited the bankrupts' creditors. There is some force in that: Re Bendel; Ex parte Bendel v Pattison (1997) 80 FCR 123 at 132. But once again, any failure of the trustee to comply with s 73(2A) would not necessarily invalidate what flowed thereafter for the reasons I have already given. I do not see any non-compliance here as fatal to a vote. That is not to say that if the context of the case was injunctive relief to prevent a meeting going ahead because of inadequate information in the opinion of the trustee that such an injunction would not be given.

73 Also, to reinforce what I said earlier, to the extent that there has been inadequate information in the opinion of the trustee, the egregiousness or otherwise of any such error would be, as the asserted error of the trustee here is, a relevant consideration for the operation of ss 30 , 178 , 222 and 222C . Also, for completeness, I do not think it should be accepted as it was submitted here that the first Naylor proposal was not bone fide . The Naylors, who put on evidence, were not cross-examined about that; cf Re Bendel 80 FCR 123 at 131.

74 The second Naylor proposal was equally not too vague or uncertain in my view. There was an unconditional offer of payment even if it came from a finance company who had a letterhead without an address except a post box. The terms of any mortgage were not necessary to vote on. The reduced security from the Naylors' mother dropping out was not a matter for the creditors to be concerned with save and except that it may have meant that the Naylors were not able to last very long out of bankruptcy. But again, given that the creditors were being paid in one lump sum that was not their concern. As to whether there was a certainty of the money being available, these were matters, once again, for the creditors to assess and the trustee to give his opinion on.

75 The second proposal can be seen, I think, to be an amendment of the first proposal. The provider of the money changed, the mortgage arrangements changed and although there were the variations from $685,000 down to $620,000 this was in substance no different to the earlier proposal. Even if I am wrong that there was not an amendment but a new proposal, once again, given the fact that the matter went to the creditors pursuant to the meeting, I do not see the breach of procedure, if it be such, has a nullifying effect on what occurred.</text>

<tocase>Re Edwards (1987) 14 FCR 113 </tocase>
<text>62 The first argument is that the first Naylor proposal was an impermissible joint or unitary composition. Section 73 , it was submitted, did not permit two bankrupts to put a proposal in one document. I do not agree. The proposal was joint and several. Section 73 requires a proposal to the bankrupts' creditors. There is no reason why one proposal cannot be put forward, as long as it was put forward to all three groups of creditors, as it plainly was and was intended to be. The proposal, if put to a meeting of an individual body of creditors, can be seen as a proposal put forward by the bankrupt for his creditors to deal with. It is said that the proposal to each estate cannot come in the same joint form and that three cases stand as authority for that proposition; Re Pepper (1969) 14 FLR 282 , Re Tynan; Ex parte Tynan (1997) 16 FCR 307 and Re Edwards (1987) 14 FCR 113.

66 In Re Edwards 14 FCR 113 French J dealt with one joint composition covering two estates, a joint estate and a several estate. Despite some of the language in the judgment, it is clear that the vice identified by his Honour was the single approval for all the estates in one meeting. This can be seen by his Honour's reliance upon the reference to Re Forbes 24 FLR 87. French J said the following at 116:
 
 In a case where the bankrupts have some joint creditors and some separate creditors it would be inappropriate to submit the separate creditors to a binding composition on which they may have been out-voted by joint creditors with quite different interests. Similarly it would be inappropriate to admit to a vote on a joint composition, separate creditors whose interests might conflict with those of the joint creditors. 
 
 Re Forbes was a decision of Judge White in the Court of Insolvency of South Australia in which his Honour declared void a composition purportedly entered into under Part X of the Act, by a husband and wife who were not in partnership but who had substantial joint creditors. Each also had separate debts. 
 
 A joint meeting of creditors was called at which a composite special resolution was passed. Creditors of all classes voted on the composite resolution. 
 

His Honour then quoted White J at page 88. French J concluded his judgment by saying:
 
 The proposal if it is to be proceed will have to be recast in the form of separate proposals for each of the bankrupts. Each will require a separate meeting of creditors although the meetings can be held concurrently provided that the procedure necessary to maintain the distinction between the two proposals is followed. On this basis I have no alternative but to dismiss the application.

67 In Re Tynan 16 FCR 307, French J had a case before him where there were bankrupts who had been partners with no separate bankrupt estate. Some passages of the judgment of French J appear, taken literally, to prevent under s 73 any joint composition to be entered where there is more than one estate. I do not think his Honour's reasons should be so read, especially in the light of the terms of Re Edwards 119 FCR 113 in the same year. By his Honour's reference to Re Pepper 14 FLR 282 and Re Edwards 14 FCR 113 (and through it Re Forbes 24 FLR 97) and via what his Honour said at pages 312 and 313 about the need for separate meetings, I conclude that his Honour was dealing with the same essential difficulty, that is, of mixing up the voting of different creditors at different meetings.</text>

<tocase>Re Forbes (1974) 24 FLR 87 </tocase>
<text>64 In Re Forbes (1974) 24 FLR 87, White J of the Court of Insolvency of South Australia discussed Part IX and s 187 of the Bankruptcy Act . The issue there identified was not the putting of a composite proposal, but the putting of a composite proposal to one undifferentiated meeting. The essence of the matter was put at pages 88 and 93, as follows:
 
 In my opinion, this procedure is not open to debtors under Part X and the alleged composition is void. They should have held separate meetings (albeit concurrently) to which separate special resolutions could have been submitted to the relevant classes of creditors, in order that the wishes of interested parties be ascertained, including the existence or otherwise of the appropriate majorities both in number and value. Where there are joint creditors, it is a matter of necessity rather than convenience that meetings are held at the one time and the one place. As will be seen later, care must be taken at such concurrent meetings to separate out the different resolutions relating to each debtor and the classes of creditors entitled to vote in relation to each resolution. 
 
 ... 
 
 I am happy to say that I reached this conclusion before reading Mr Irlicht's small but excellent book "Assignments, Arrangements and Compositions by Debtors" where he expresses the opinion ...: "There should be a separate meeting with respect to each debtor, although there is no objection against holding meetings of more than one debtor concurrently, providing that a special resolution is passed with respect to each debtor (of course only the creditors of the debtor in question can vote on the relevant resolution, but creditors to whom debtors are jointly indebted may vote on the resolutions with respect to each debtor). This procedure of holding concurrent meetings is best adopted when there are a number of joint debtors".

65 The case does not assist with the question whether one group of creditors should not have the opportunity to vote on a proposal which involved another debtor.

66 In Re Edwards 14 FCR 113 French J dealt with one joint composition covering two estates, a joint estate and a several estate. Despite some of the language in the judgment, it is clear that the vice identified by his Honour was the single approval for all the estates in one meeting. This can be seen by his Honour's reliance upon the reference to Re Forbes 24 FLR 87. French J said the following at 116:
 
 In a case where the bankrupts have some joint creditors and some separate creditors it would be inappropriate to submit the separate creditors to a binding composition on which they may have been out-voted by joint creditors with quite different interests. Similarly it would be inappropriate to admit to a vote on a joint composition, separate creditors whose interests might conflict with those of the joint creditors. 
 
 Re Forbes was a decision of Judge White in the Court of Insolvency of South Australia in which his Honour declared void a composition purportedly entered into under Part X of the Act, by a husband and wife who were not in partnership but who had substantial joint creditors. Each also had separate debts. 
 
 A joint meeting of creditors was called at which a composite special resolution was passed. Creditors of all classes voted on the composite resolution. 
 

His Honour then quoted White J at page 88. French J concluded his judgment by saying:
 
 The proposal if it is to be proceed will have to be recast in the form of separate proposals for each of the bankrupts. Each will require a separate meeting of creditors although the meetings can be held concurrently provided that the procedure necessary to maintain the distinction between the two proposals is followed. On this basis I have no alternative but to dismiss the application.

63 In Re Pepper 14 FLR 282, Gibbs J (as he then was) decided that s 55(1) of the Bankruptcy Act , permitting a debtor to present a petition against himself, did not permit a number of debtors to present a joint petition. This construction was reached because the contrary would have permitted not only joint debtors, that is, debtors to a joint obligation, but several debtors who had no joint assets to present a petition. This case is of no particular assistance here, where as long as the proposal was one which the individual creditors of the individual bankrupt's estate can vote on, no inconvenience results therefrom. There is no inconvenience here of the kind referred to by Gibbs J in that case.

67 In Re Tynan 16 FCR 307, French J had a case before him where there were bankrupts who had been partners with no separate bankrupt estate.

The public and private interest in discharge or annulment can be seen in many cases such as Re Barton (1980) 43 FLR 245, Re Stainton; Ex parte Board of Trade (1887) 19 QBD 182, Re Haines (1937) 10 ABC 83, Re Gray (1960) 19 ABC 29 and Re Prince (1961) 19 ABC 39 and see also Ex parte Selby; in the matter of Selby and Norton (1855) 43 ER 1437 per Lord Justice Knight-Bruce.</text>

<tocase>Re Tynan; ex parte Tynan (1997) 16 FCR 307</tocase>
<text>62 The first argument is that the first Naylor proposal was an impermissible joint or unitary composition. Section 73 , it was submitted, did not permit two bankrupts to put a proposal in one document. I do not agree. The proposal was joint and several. Section 73 requires a proposal to the bankrupts' creditors. There is no reason why one proposal cannot be put forward, as long as it was put forward to all three groups of creditors, as it plainly was and was intended to be. The proposal, if put to a meeting of an individual body of creditors, can be seen as a proposal put forward by the bankrupt for his creditors to deal with. It is said that the proposal to each estate cannot come in the same joint form and that three cases stand as authority for that proposition; Re Pepper (1969) 14 FLR 282 , Re Tynan; Ex parte Tynan (1997) 16 FCR 307 and Re Edwards (1987) 14 FCR 113.

67 In Re Tynan 16 FCR 307, French J had a case before him where there were bankrupts who had been partners with no separate bankrupt estate. Some passages of the judgment of French J appear, taken literally, to prevent under s 73 any joint composition to be entered where there is more than one estate. I do not think his Honour's reasons should be so read, especially in the light of the terms of Re Edwards 119 FCR 113 in the same year. By his Honour's reference to Re Pepper 14 FLR 282 and Re Edwards 14 FCR 113 (and through it Re Forbes 24 FLR 97) and via what his Honour said at pages 312 and 313 about the need for separate meetings, I conclude that his Honour was dealing with the same essential difficulty, that is, of mixing up the voting of different creditors at different meetings.</text>

<text>55 It goes without saying that the procedures required should be viewed from the perspective of the interests of all creditors. In a given case, which is not this one, a Court might look very carefully at any procedure leading to a composition dominated by creditors related to the bankrupt or reflecting a lack of commercial morality or sharp practice. Parliament, however, has chosen to provide in s 74(5) for the annulment and thus for the consequences that flow therefrom: Oates v Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 27 FCR 289 , Re Coyle (1993) 42 FCR 72 , Theissbacher v MacGregor Garrick &amp; Co [1993] 2 Qd R 223, Pascoe; in the matter of Hudson [2005] FCA 1421 , Worrall v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 51 FCR 304 and Union Club v Battenberg [2006] NSWCA 72 ; (2006) 66 NSWLR 1.</text>

<tocase>Van Reesema v Official Trustee (1983) 69 FLR 424 </tocase>
<text>52 The applicants emphasise the expression used by Sheppard J in Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1983) 69 FLR 424 at 431 when his Honour used the expression "great power" of the trustee in bankruptcy in preventing a discharge from bankruptcy occurring by entering an objection to discharge. That expression was used by the Full Court in Prentice v Wood [2002] FCA 214 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296 at 300 in discussing the power in s 149C(1)(c). I do not find those expressions of any particular assistance in construing ss 73 and 74 and in ascertaining the statutory consequence of any failure to comply (if that occurred) with ss 73 and 74 .</text>

<tocase>Wenkart v Pantzer [2003] FCA 432</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/432.html</AustLII>
<text>69 The next basis was that the first Naylor proposal was vague and uncertain as the proposal had no unconditional finance. The proposal was for a loan from Nation Finance. The full terms of the proposal are annexed. Inquiries of the trustee revealed a certain inadequacy as to the understanding of the finance. In my view, that did not stop there being a proposal, rather it said something as to its attractiveness. It is true, as Beaumont J said in Wenkart v Pantzer [2003] FCA 432 at [26] that s 73(2A) and (4) indicate the following:
 
 Both these paragraphs indicate that the trustee is concerned here with matters of substance and not governed by any mechanical form in deciding how to respond. Thus, if the trustee does not have sufficient material upon which the trustee could indicate one way or the other whether a proposal would benefit the bankrupt's creditors generally, then, in my opinion there is no absolut,e and certainly no unconditional obligation on the trustee to call a meeting of creditors.

70 This does not mean, however, that, if a proposal which in all the circumstances the trustee decides is sufficiently formulated to go to creditors with the view of the trustee contemplated by 73(2A), that a resolution accepting or rejecting it by creditors cannot be seen to have taken place. It will be a matter for the trustee to judge whether or not there is sufficient information for there to be a proposal requiring him or her to go to a meeting. A Court may have to assess that at a point in time before any meeting. It is unnecessary to lay down definitional criteria for that beyond the words of the Bankruptcy Act . Each individual case will be different, the circumstances of the estate and the terms of the terms of the proposal will be different.</text>
