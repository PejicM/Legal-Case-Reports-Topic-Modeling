<tocase>Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v State of Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62</tocase>
<text>The discretion conferred by s 87(1) must be exercised judicially, and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v State of Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62 at [7] . One of the most important purposes of the Act is the resolution of disputes by negotiation and agreement rather than by litigation.</text>

<tocase>Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/474.html</AustLII>
<text>As North J said in Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria (' Lovett ') [2007] FCA 474 at [61] (with whom I respectfully agree): 
 "... when the Court is examining the appropriateness of an agreement, it is not required to examine whether the agreement is grounded on a factual basis which would satisfy the Court at a hearing of the application. The primary consideration of the Court is to determine whether there is an agreement and whether it was freely entered into on an informed basis...".

It follows that the central issue in an application for a consent determination under s 87 of the Act is whether there exists a free and informed agreement between the parties.

Turning then to the involvement of the state respondent party, the Northern Territory. In my view, it is clear on the evidence before me that the Northern Territory has taken a real and significant interest in the proceedings. Before the proposed consent orders were signed, the Northern Territory had Emeritus Professor Sansom consider the anthropological reports prepared by Mr Elliott going to the existence of native title. Professor Sansom's queries in relation to the report initially provided were subsequently answered to his satisfaction in Mr Elliott's supplementary report. Furthermore, in March 2009, the Northern Territory Cabinet considered the proposed consent orders and instructed the Solicitor for the Northern Territory to agree to the proposed consent determination of native title. The joint submissions of the applicant and the Northern Territory indicate that the parties are in agreement that there is adequate evidence to support the consent determination. I understand the term adequate evidence to reflect the fact that there is a credible or arguable basis for the application, which in my view is the appropriate standard: see Lovett at [37]-[38]. I am therefore satisfied that the interests of the community generally have been properly considered by the Northern Territory.

For these reasons, I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the Court make the consent determination sought.

The applicant has nominated the Ilkewartn Ywel Aboriginal Corporation ('the Corporation') as the prescribed body corporate to hold in trust the native title of the claimant group following the determination of these proceedings pursuant to s 57(2) of the Act. The nomination is in writing and the Corporation has given its consent to the nomination. I am satisfied that the requirements of the Act have been met.</text>

<tocase>Munn (for and on behalf of the Gungari People) v Queensland [2001] FCA 1229</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1229.html</AustLII>
<text>In assessing whether a free and informed agreement has been reached, the Court pays close regard to the process the state respondent party has followed in assessing the evidence establishing the existence of native title. On this aspect, Emmett J observed in Munn v Queensland (' Munn ')[2001] FCA 1229; [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 that (at [29]): 
 "... [This] would include a consideration of the extent to which the State is a party, on the basis that the State, or at least a Minister of State, appears in the capacity of parens patriae to look after the interests of the community generally. The mere fact that the State was a party may not be sufficient. The Court may need to be satisfied that the State has in fact taken a real interest in the proceeding in the interests of the community generally. That may involve the Court being satisfied that the State has given appropriate consideration to the evidence that has been adduced, or intended to be adduced, in order to reach the compromise that is proposed. The Court, in my view, needs to be satisfied at least that the State, through competent legal representation, is satisfied as to the cogency of the evidence upon which the applicants rely." 

I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations.

Other important factors that various decisions of the Court have pointed to in assessing whether the agreement reached was free and informed, include:

In this case, the parties have had the benefit of independent and competent legal representation in arriving at the agreement, the terms of the minute are unambiguous and clear and the agreement has been produced as a result of a process of negotiation.</text>

<tocase>Wilson v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 800</tocase>
<text>This is only the second consent determination in the southern part of the Northern Territory and the third in the whole of the Northern Territory I made a consent determination in Elliott last week: see Wilson v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 800. Nonetheless, given the co-operative approach of the legal practitioners and the parties I have mentioned above, I am confident that these two consent determinations will be the first of many that the Court will be making in the Northern Territory in coming months and years.

I congratulate the parties on reaching this agreement. In so doing, I congratulate the native title holders whose rights will now be recognised. The order that the Court will now make determines, under the laws of Australia, that native title exists according to the traditional laws and customs of the Ilkewartn and Ywel People, and is held by those peoples. Of course, this order does not grant something new to the Ilkewartn and Ywel peoples, it merely recognises what they have long held.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Reeves.
