<text>In Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v State of South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 , Mason A-CJ said at 153 that in order to secure an interlocutory injunction in private law cases: 
 
 "The plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted and (3) that the balance of convenience requires the granting of an injunction."
