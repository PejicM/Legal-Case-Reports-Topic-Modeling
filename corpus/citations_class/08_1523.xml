<text>16 In Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor [1994] HCA 12 ; (1994) 120 ALR 586 at 589 Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ observed:
 ... Although a plaintiff is often granted leave to re-plead if a statement of claim is struck out, there are some cases where the plaintiff so misconceives the cause of action that the action ought to be brought to an end.

17 In this case I am not satisfied that the application and the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action or that the applicant so misconceives the cause of action that the action should be brought to an end at this stage. At present, however, the case the seventh respondent faces is not pleaded with sufficient clarity for the seventh respondent to meet it. In Court this morning the applicant indicated that she is currently seeking legal advice and would require at least two and a half weeks to do so.

18 In my view the appropriate orders, in addition to the consent order which I have already made this morning concerning the second respondent, are as follows:
 
1. The application and the statement of claim so far as the applicant seeks relief against the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth respondents, should be struck out.
 
2. The applicant be given leave to file and serve an amended application and an amended statement of claim by 4.00 pm on 29 October 2008, in default of which the application so far as the seventh respondent is concerned stands dismissed.

19 Counsel for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents submitted that their clients did not seek any orders as to costs. No such submission was made by the first respondent. In relation to the first respondent I order that costs be reserved.

 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.
