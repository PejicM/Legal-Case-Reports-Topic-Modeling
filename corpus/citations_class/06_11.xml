<tocase>Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/53.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts. Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.'

24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned. There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department. The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning. However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context. That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose. And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.' [Footnotes omitted]

26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules. The ACCV was not under ministerial control. Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding. Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register. The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.

51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended. Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice. Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common. It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art. In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available. It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter. I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art. This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1919/72.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530 531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies. Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to. The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.'</text>

<tocase>R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460</tocase>
<text>27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972 1975 (SA). At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset. At 284 285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth. His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth. At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC. His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown. At 285 286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown. Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</text>

<tocase>Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/34.html</AustLII>
<text>28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control. By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown. The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)). The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7. The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence. In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance. See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347 350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</text>

32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws. The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity. See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.

33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose. That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria. The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view. The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.

34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning. His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them. He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</text>

<tocase>Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/408.html</AustLII>
<text>52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities. This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case. There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust. The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.

53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning. When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.

54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</text>

<tocase>EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No. 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382</tocase>
<text>59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding. To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act. In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest. Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie. on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed. The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard. It should be calculated to the date of judgment. As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic). It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No. 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] . The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent. The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment.</text>
