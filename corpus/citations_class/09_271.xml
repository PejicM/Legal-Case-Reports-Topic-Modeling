<text>The respondent in written submissions referred to comments of the delegate in Americana International Limited v Suyen Corporation [2008] ATMO 4 at [28] - [29] . The respondent contended that the decision in Health World Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 is distinguishable from the facts in these proceedings, in that in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 while the relevant companies had the same directors they had different shareholders, whereas in these proceedings there was not only a formal assignment and licence but Mr Lawrence was the sole shareholder and managing director of both the respondent and The Food Channel Pty Ltd. The respondent also referred to Oakley, Inc (2003) 58 IPR 452 at [30], as already set out in this judgment.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1960/47.html</AustLII>
<text>It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008)). As Finkelstein J observed in Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [25]: 
 In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: In Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1886) 32 ChD 311 , 319; Seven-Up Co v O T Ltd [1947] HCA 56 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 , 626. Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 citing Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202. A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia , at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1994/936.html</AustLII>
<text>In addition to the contention that, on the face of the application, the respondent is the owner of the trade mark and there is no evidence that anyone other than the respondent was ever the owner of the trade mark, the respondent also submits, in summary: At the time of the application on 28 August 2003 the owner of the trade mark was The Food Channel Pty Ltd. The applicant can apply for a trade mark even if it does not intend to use it provided it has authorised or intends to authorise another person to use it, or if it intends to assign it to another. On 15 January 2004 the application for the trade mark was formally assigned by The Food Channel Pty Ltd to the respondent (cf respondent's written submissions p 17). Mr Lawrence as the sole shareholder and managing director of The Food Channel Pty Ltd and the respondent and author of the trade mark properly authorised his companies first The Food Channel Pty Ltd and then upon assignment the respondent to use the trade mark with a licence back to The Food Channel Pty Ltd from the respondent after the assignment with the intention to use the mark on the goods being printed matter in this case printed recipes (cf respondent's written submissions p 19). "It may be fair to say Mr Lawrence sees the business as his own and sometimes confuses the distinction between himself and his companies, as might be seen from the nature of his affidavits where he defines the Respondent as the 'Food Channel' and (sic) then talks generally about the business of Food Channel meaning his business generally being himself and both of his companies. This is understandable as he is not a lawyer and it appears on the face of the affidavit that he did not have legal representation or advice at the time of drawing and filing of his main affidavit. As the sole shareholder and director of both companies he looks upon them both as his business. 
He did however obtain legal advice at the time of the assignment and formally transferred the trade mark application from The Food Channel Pty Ltd to Food Network Pty Ltd and formally lodged the assignment with the Trade Marks Office where the assignment was formally recorded, with Food Channel network as the new owner" (respondent's written submissions pp 19-20).
 In order to establish its opposition under s 58 an opponent must show that: the respective trade marks of applicant and opponent be either identical or substantially identical ( Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Limited [1994] FCA 936 ; (1994) 31 IPR 375) ; and the respective goods or services of the parties be the "same kind of thing" ( Re Hicks' Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636 ; and a person other than the applicant has the earlier claim to ownership based on use prior to both the present application to register and actual use of the trade mark by the applicant ( Settef SpA (1987) 10 IPR 402 at 413 and Re Hicks' Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636) ; the respondent contends that the applicant cannot show any of these elements and therefore must fail under s 58.</text>

<tocase>Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) v Caterpillar Tractor Co [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1983/145.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 44(1) was considered in considerable detail by the delegate in her decision. In summary, the delegate found as follows: the applicant's trade marks have earlier priority dates than that of the respondent (at [18]); principles applicable to the operation of s 44 can be found in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 594-595 (at [20]); the applicant had submitted that the word "network" is understood by the relevant public as being the plural of "channel" and that therefore "Food Channel" and "Food Network" will not be distinguished in the marketplace. The delegate observed that she was aware that there were various entities in the television industry within Australia which used a naming convention for both the overall television network and individual channels within that network. However the delegate was satisfied from her own knowledge of the Australian television market that the public understanding of the relationship between the names is as a result of exposure over time to the naming convention, rather than the result of an inherent equivalence in terminology. Although the delegate understood that most television networks in the Australian market involved several related channels, she was not satisfied that at this stage, and failing an educative process of the public whereby the public came to recognise that a television network as comprising individual television channels, that the terms were the same. Accordingly the delegate did not consider the trade marks, when viewed as wholes, as being deceptively similar (at [21]-[23]); the delegate was satisfied that the market for "printed matter, periodical publications, books and newspapers; paper and cardboard articles; posters, calendars; writing instruments, pencils, pens, stationery, writing pads, greeting cards; photographs", being goods within class 16, is separate from that of the television broadcasting and television entertainment markets (at [24]); the delegate noted that within the applicant's service claims in class 41 in respect of registrations 881666 and 881667 was the item "publication of printed publications." The delegate referred to Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) v Caterpillar Tractor Co [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511 where Lockhart J had considered service marks and the problems of confusion with goods marks. The delegate considered that publication services are closely related to the results of those services, namely printed publications, be they books, leaflets, newspapers or newsletters, and that the presence of those goods within the specification was sufficient to trigger the particular provision of s 44 which deals with goods and services. Accordingly, the delegate was satisfied that some of the applicant's claimed services, namely the "publication of printed publications", were closely related to some of the respondent's goods, namely "printed publications, periodical publications, books and newspapers" (at [25]-[26]). Issues in contention

First, I reject the respondent's contention that, because the applicant's trade mark is registered for services and trade mark 967804 relates to goods, s 44(1) is not relevant. Section 44(1) clearly contemplates rejection of the application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of goods , where a trade mark applicant's trade mark is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to, inter alia , a trade mark registered by another person (or sought to be registered) in respect of similar goods or closely related services . As the delegate observed, this issue was considered in some depth by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511 , particularly at 522-523. I similarly note the recognition to the possibility of deceptive similarity between a service mark and a mark in respect of closely related goods discussed in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 380.</text>

<text>It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008)).

<tocase>Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/196.html</AustLII>
<text>It is also clear from the cases that ownership of a trade mark can vest in another without formal assignment, for example in a corporate alter ego of the creator of the trade mark. Examples of the application of this principle are Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. I shall consider these cases later in this judgment.

However, the respondent relies in its written submissions on Revlon Inc v Cripps &amp; Lee Ltd [1980] FSR 85 , Polo Textile Industries v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 , Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. As the respondent has relied on these cases in the context of referring to s 27(1) of the Act, I can only infer that the respondent claims that, at the filing date, there was implied authorisation by The Food Channel Pty Ltd of the respondent to use trade mark 967804 within the meaning of s 27(1)(b)(ii). Was there implied authorisation to use?

It may very well be the case that Mr Lawrence initially considered that The Food Channel Pty Ltd should apply for registration of trade mark 967804, but later considered a more appropriate trade mark applicant would be the respondent with the result that the trade mark application were assigned to the respondent. Commercially, this is perfectly acceptable. However from the perspective of the Act, this approach would only be acceptable if The Food Channel Pty Ltd were also the owner at the filing date (s 58). If The Food Channel Pty Ltd was not the owner at the filing date, as indeed the evidence suggests, but Mr Lawrence subsequently considered that the appropriate trade mark applicant should be the respondent, then Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 supports the proposition that the trade mark application should have been withdrawn and a fresh trade mark application lodged ( Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 at [130] - [131] ).

I have already considered evidence from Mr Lawrence that the respondent was the owner at the filing date, and substantial conflicting evidence as to who the owner has been throughout the application process. The respondent's submissions as to s 27(1) do not clarify this matter.

I do not consider that reliance on s 27(1) assists the respondent in discharging its evidentiary onus under s 58.</text>

<tocase>Food Channel Network Pty Ltd v Television Food Network G.P. [2007] ATMO 68</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/ATMO/2007/68.html</AustLII>
<text>Accordingly the delegate ordered that the trade mark proceed to registration under the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Act") ( Television Food Network G.P. v Food Channel Network Pty Ltd [2006] ATMO 88). For convenience I shall refer to the trade mark the subject of these proceedings as "trade mark 967 804".

On 12 March 2007 a notice of appeal was filed by leave in this Court by the applicant, Television Food Network, G.P. The orders sought by the applicant are as follows: registration of the Trade Mark Application be refused; and the respondent pay the applicant's costs of, and incidental to, the opposition before the delegate and of this appeal.

The applicant in these proceedings is a Delaware partnership with its principal place of business in New York. Evidence of the applicant's business activities was given by Ms Kristen Jordan, Senior Vice President of international development at Scripps Network LLC (Scripps), which company is the managing general partner of the applicant. In her affidavit sworn 3 October 2007 Ms Jordan deposed that the applicant broadcasts programs as the "Food Network". The Food Network is a television programming network, web site and publisher featuring a variety of ways food can be prepared and how food is integrated into daily lives. Food Network is one of the flagship brand of Scripps.

Although not directly relevant to these proceedings, on 24 July 2007 an Opposition Hearing was conducted by IP Australia in relation to registration of the applicant's trade marks 938228, 881666 and 881667. The delegate found that no grounds for opposition to the registration of the applicant's trade marks had been established and directed that the applications proceed to registration ( Food Channel Network Pty Ltd v Television Food Network G.P. [2007] ATMO 68).

On 29 November 2006 the delegate dismissed the opposition to registration of trade mark 967804. In summary the delegate's reasons were as follows: the delegate was not satisfied that it was appropriate to draw an inference that the respondent did not intend to use its trade mark. Accordingly, the delegate could not be satisfied that the applicant had substantiated its ground of opposition under s 59 of the Act; there was insufficient evidence that the words "channel" and "network" were interchangeable in the minds of the viewing public. Accordingly, the delegate could not be satisfied that the applicant had substantiated its ground of opposition under s 43 of the Act; although some of the applicant's services were closely related to those of the respondent, the delegate found the marks were not deceptively similar. Outside the realm of television broadcasting and television entertainment any perceived connection between "network" and "channel" is much reduced. Accordingly the delegate could not be satisfied that the applicant had substantiated its ground of opposition under s 44 of the Act.

In support of the second point, the applicant has submitted, in summary, that: in relation to the possible use by the respondent of trade mark 967804, it is clear from evidence of Mr Lawrence that the respondent intended to use an alternative, but similar, trade mark. In particular the applicant referred to the affidavit of Ian Robert Tannahill sworn 6 August 2007, wherein Mr Tannahill, a patent attorney who appeared for the applicant at the opposition hearing, deposed that at the opposition hearing Mr Lawrence had said the respondent would use an alternative, although somewhat similar mark. The amended trade mark, considered by the delegate in her decision (T elevision Food Network G.P. [2006] ATMO 88 at [11] - [13] ) is as follows: 
 
 
("the amended version")

In my view the applicant has made a prima facie case that The Food Channel Pty Ltd did not as at the filing date intend to use trade mark 967804. Further, I consider that the applicant has made a prima facie case that the respondent did not intend to use trade mark 967804. Accordingly the evidentiary onus as to intention shifts to the respondent. Submissions of the respondent

Sixth, I do not agree with the view of the delegate that the fact that Mr Lawrence was prepared to attend a hearing to attempt to support his company's application would tend, to some degree, to counter an inference that there was no intention that trade mark 967804 be used (cf Television Food Network G.P . [2006] ATMO 88 at [13] ).

Finally, I note that the delegate in her decision considered that the "amended" version of the trade mark which the respondent has used, and to which reference is made in Mr Tannahill's affidavit discussed earlier in this judgment, could be considered use of the trade mark 967804. Section 7 of the Act provides: 
 (1) If the Registrar or a prescribed court, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, thinks fit, the Registrar or the court may decide that a person has used a trade mark if it is established that the person has used the trade mark with additions or alterations that do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark.

In these proceedings, as I noted earlier in this judgment, the applicant submitted that a new trade mark application should be filed if the second mark incorporates additions or alterations which are material. In this case the key differences between trade mark 967804 and the amended version are:

The issue for decision in relation to s 59 is whether the applicant, defined in s 6 as the person in whose name the application is for the time being proceeding, intended to use the trade mark. Mr Lawrence has never been an applicant for the trade mark. There is no evidence before me that either The Food Channel Pty Ltd (as the original applicant) or the respondent (after the assignment of the application for registration) ever actually used the amended version of the trade mark at any time, so as to show use of (or intention to use) the trade mark by either of those entities at any time. In my view Mr Lawrence's evidence, rather than clarifying any intention to use in any of the companies which he controls and which have been trade mark applicants, confuses the issue further. There is no evidence before me that any use Mr Lawrence made of the amended version of the trade mark was in any way related to either The Food Channel Pty Ltd or the respondent. I do not find discussion of this issue by the delegate helpful comments of the delegate in relation to use of the amended version are again confined to use of that amended version by Mr Lawrence ( Television Food Network G.P. [2006] ATMO 88 at [12] ).

In my view the applicant succeeds in establishing lack of the requisite intention for the purposes of s 59 of the Act. I consider that the delegate erred in finding that the respondent intended to use trade mark 967804 in relation to the goods nominated in the trade mark application. Had I not already found in favour of the applicant in relation to s 58 of the Act, I would be prepared to make the orders sought by the applicant on the basis of s 59.

Section 44(1) of the Act provides as follows: 
 44 Identical etc. trade marks 

 
 (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), an application for the registration of a trade mark ( applicant's trade mark ) in respect of goods ( applicant's goods ) must be rejected if: 

(a) the applicant's trade mark is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to:
 
(i) a trade mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods or closely related services; or
 
(ii) a trade mark whose registration in respect of similar goods or closely related services is being sought by another person; and
 
(b) the priority date for the registration of the applicant's trade mark in respect of the applicant's goods is not earlier than the priority date for the registration of the other trade mark in respect of the similar goods or closely related services.</text>

<tocase>Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/605.html</AustLII>
<text>As has been observed elsewhere, s 58 is conventionally used as a ground of opposition where disputing parties have had a business or contractual relationship, and are in dispute as to which of those parties is the true owner of the mark ( Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008) p 380, cf Elkington B, Hall M, Kell D, Trade Mark Law in Australia (Butterworths, 2000) p 77). However s 58 does not confine opposition to registration of a trade mark to a party itself claiming ownership of that trade mark. Examples of cases in which claims albeit unsuccessful were made by a third party against the registered owner of a trade mark pursuant to s 58 are Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 and Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98. Indeed in this case the respondent has not disputed the standing of the applicant to oppose registration of trade mark 967804 on the ground of s 58. I shall return to these cases later in this judgment. Onus

Whether the act of making an application to register a trade mark in the name of a party other than the owner is a fatal defect in that application was given some consideration in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161. The decision in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 was delivered after my judgment in this case was reserved. The Court in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; 2008) 76 IPR 161 also considered the decision in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98.

So far as is relevant in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 the cross-claimant in that case claimed that the validity of registration of a trade mark was to be determined at the filing date.

The trial judge in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 referred to Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 where the trial judge had noted the innocent error in registering the wrong applicant. Further, in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 the trial judge was satisfied that the company to which the application for registration was eventually assigned was the owner of the trade mark in question (at [135]-[136]).

Both Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 are distinguishable from this case because in both cases the ownership position was clear. In contrast, I do not accept that the Act sanctions a position in which an application can be made where ownership of a trade mark is not capable of identification during the application process, and a finding cannot be made that the applicant was the owner, as is the case in these proceedings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/14.html</AustLII>
<text>The principles articulated in Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 are not in issue in these proceedings. Contrary to the submission of the respondent, I find that there is no inconsistency between these principles and the concept of shift of the evidentiary onus of proof referred to by Jacobson J in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478. I note in passing that an appeal against the decision of Jacobson J in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 was recently dismissed by the Full Court ( Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 14) , although the Full Court did not consider the evidentiary issue raised by the respondent in this case. I accept the submission of the applicant that, once the opposer to registration makes a prima facie case, the evidentiary onus as to ownership shifts to the applicant for registration.

The respondent in written submissions referred to comments of the delegate in Americana International Limited v Suyen Corporation [2008] ATMO 4 at [28] - [29] . The respondent contended that the decision in Health World Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 is distinguishable from the facts in these proceedings, in that in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 while the relevant companies had the same directors they had different shareholders, whereas in these proceedings there was not only a formal assignment and licence but Mr Lawrence was the sole shareholder and managing director of both the respondent and The Food Channel Pty Ltd. The respondent also referred to Oakley, Inc (2003) 58 IPR 452 at [30], as already set out in this judgment.</text>

<tocase>Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119</tocase>
<text>It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008)). As Finkelstein J observed in Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [25]: 
 In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: In Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1886) 32 ChD 311 , 319; Seven-Up Co v O T Ltd [1947] HCA 56 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 , 626. Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 citing Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202. A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia , at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.</text>

<tocase>McCormick &amp; Company Inc v McCormick (2000) 15 IPR 102</tocase>
<text>The respondent submitted in summary that, because there was no evidence from the Australian licensees of the applicant, there is no evidence of any reputation of the applicant or its trade marks in Australia; further, no other evidence was given as to the applicant's reputation in Australia prior to the priority date of trade mark 967804. The respondent also referred to McCormick &amp; Company Inc v McCormick (2000) 15 IPR 102, and, in what appears to be a confused submission, another of the respondent's trade marks.

In order to successfully oppose registration of a trade mark pursuant to s 60 the applicant must satisfy the Court that: Its trade marks had acquired a reputation in Australia in relation to goods or services before the priority date of trade mark 967804; and Because of the reputation of the applicant's trade marks, the use of trade mark 967804 would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

The current form of s 60 of the Act follows amendments to the Act by the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 ( Cth). The most significant amendment to s 60 effected in 2006 was the removal of the reference to the opposed trade mark being "substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to" a relevant trade mark.

First, in McCormick [2000] FCA 1335 ; (2000) 51 IPR 102 at [81] Kenny J said: 
 What is intended by the word "reputation" in s 60? The word is defined in The Macquarie Dictionary as follows: 

 
 reputation ... 1. the estimation in which a person or thing is held, esp. by the community or the public generally; repute ... 2. favourable repute; good name ... 3. A favourable and publicly recognised name or standing for merit, achievement, etc. ... 4. The estimation or name of being, having done, etc, something specified.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/1404.html</AustLII>
<text>As has been observed elsewhere, s 58 is conventionally used as a ground of opposition where disputing parties have had a business or contractual relationship, and are in dispute as to which of those parties is the true owner of the mark ( Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008) p 380, cf Elkington B, Hall M, Kell D, Trade Mark Law in Australia (Butterworths, 2000) p 77). However s 58 does not confine opposition to registration of a trade mark to a party itself claiming ownership of that trade mark. Examples of cases in which claims albeit unsuccessful were made by a third party against the registered owner of a trade mark pursuant to s 58 are Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 and Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98. Indeed in this case the respondent has not disputed the standing of the applicant to oppose registration of trade mark 967804 on the ground of s 58. I shall return to these cases later in this judgment. Onus

Whether the act of making an application to register a trade mark in the name of a party other than the owner is a fatal defect in that application was given some consideration in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161. The decision in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 was delivered after my judgment in this case was reserved. The Court in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; 2008) 76 IPR 161 also considered the decision in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98.

The trial judge in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 referred to Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 where the trial judge had noted the innocent error in registering the wrong applicant. Further, in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 the trial judge was satisfied that the company to which the application for registration was eventually assigned was the owner of the trade mark in question (at [135]-[136]).

Both Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 are distinguishable from this case because in both cases the ownership position was clear. In contrast, I do not accept that the Act sanctions a position in which an application can be made where ownership of a trade mark is not capable of identification during the application process, and a finding cannot be made that the applicant was the owner, as is the case in these proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Philmac Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [2002] FCA 1551 ; (2002) 126 FCR 525</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1551.html</AustLII>
<text>It is well-established that applications of this kind, which involve an exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court and are subject to the powers of the Court under s 197 of the Act, are conducted as re-hearings and are not strictly "appeals": Blount v Registrar of Trade Marks [1998] FCA 440 ; (1998) 83 FCR 50 ; Philmac Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [2002] FCA 1551 ; (2002) 126 FCR 525.

It is not in contention that s 27 of the Act requires that there be, inter alia , use of the trade mark "in relation to the goods and/or services." As Mansfield J observed in Philmac Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1551 ; (2002) 126 FCR 525 at 539-540 it is necessary that the trade mark applicant was using or intended to use the trade mark as a trade mark. Whether a trade mark is used as a trade mark is judged objectively ( Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 438 ; (2004) 61 IPR 242 at 248-249). Thus, for example, there is authority that preliminary discussions and negotiations about whether the mark should be used ( Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414) , forwarding of samples or brochures in order ascertain whether there is a market for the relevant goods or services (cf Settef SpA v Riv-Oland Marble Co (Vic) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 IPR 402 at 417-418), and distribution of a product free of charge (cf re Ferodo Ltd's Application (1945) 62 RPC 111) do not constitute "use" of a trade mark as contemplated by the legislation.</text>

<tocase>Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410</tocase>
<text>Third, in Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410 at 424 Richardson J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal said, in considering a provision similar to s 60, that: 
 for myself I prefer to use a more neutral term such as "awareness" or "cognisance" or "knowledge" and on that basis to ask: having regard to the awareness of the opponent's mark in the New Zealand market for goods covered by the registration proposed, would the use of the applicant's mark be likely to deceive or cause confusion to persons in that market.

Fourth, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 (Cth) is helpful in interpreting the s 60. Paragraph 4.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum provides as follows: 
 4.10 TRADE MARK SIMILAR TO TRADE MARK THAT HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION IN AUSTRALIA 

 
 Section 60(a) 

 
 1 . The intention of section 60 of the Act is to implement Australia's obligations to protect well known marks under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property and the 1994 World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The provisions have not been written so as to establish a new class of trade marks ("well-known" marks) or to prescribe a particular threshold of how well-known a mark must be. Rather, the test has been written so that it can be applied to all marks. The test depends on the extent of the reputation in Australia that has been acquired by a sign. In light of that reputation, the question to be asked is whether the use of a subsequent trade mark would be likely to result in deception or confusion. Section 60 is a ground for opposition to a trade mark application for registration, which can also be used under section 88 as a basis for cancellation of a registration by the courts. 

 
 2. Under the current arrangements the provisions of section 60 require that the applied-for mark be substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark forming the basis of opposition before consideration of any deception or confusion, resulting from the reputation of the opponent's trade mark, can take place. Substantial identity and deceptive similarity are tests undertaken in examination of an application before the opposition process, and have very well established scope. 

 
 3. There have been a number of instances where a trade mark has an established reputation in Australia, and use of a subsequently applied-for trade mark would deceive or cause confusion, even though the subsequent trade mark is not substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to the original trade mark. However, because of the way paragraph 60(a) of the Act is written it is not possible to currently use this provision to prevent registration of a mark which fails the tests for substantial identity or deceptive similarity, but which nevertheless will cause confusion or deception in relation to a well-known mark. The tests for deception and confusion are all well established in judicial authority, and hinge on the question of whether or not a reasonable number of people may be caused to wonder if a trade connection exists between the marks. By removing the requirement for substantial identity or deceptive similarity from section 60, the ground for opposition under section 60 can be used to oppose the registration of a trade mark because of the possible deception or confusion arising solely from the reputation of a trade mark. 

 
 4. Under the amended provisions the consideration of oppositions would take into account the extent of the reputation of the opposing mark at the time the opposed mark was applied for, and the likelihood of deception and confusion occurring in the marketplace because of this. 

 
 4.10.1 Items 31 32 

 
 1. New paragraph 60(a) of the Act provides that a trade mark may be opposed where another trade mark has a reputation, and the registration of the opposed mark will cause confusion or deception in the market place, whether or not the reputation is built on a mark that is identical or deceptively similar to the opposed mark.

In light of this material I consider that the following is clear.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/203.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the respondent relies in its written submissions on Revlon Inc v Cripps &amp; Lee Ltd [1980] FSR 85 , Polo Textile Industries v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 , Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. As the respondent has relied on these cases in the context of referring to s 27(1) of the Act, I can only infer that the respondent claims that, at the filing date, there was implied authorisation by The Food Channel Pty Ltd of the respondent to use trade mark 967804 within the meaning of s 27(1)(b)(ii). Was there implied authorisation to use?

Further, the cases cited by the respondent support the proposition that a trade mark may be a "house mark" of a corporate group, and that members of a corporate group other than the registered proprietor may have implied authority to use it (see in particular Revlon [1980] FSR 85 at 106 per Buckley LJ and Templeman LJ at 114-115 and Polo Textiles [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 at 239). In this respect these cases do not consider issues of ownership, only authorised use of a trade mark.</text>

<tocase>Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1020.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 44(1) was considered in considerable detail by the delegate in her decision. In summary, the delegate found as follows: the applicant's trade marks have earlier priority dates than that of the respondent (at [18]); principles applicable to the operation of s 44 can be found in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 594-595 (at [20]); the applicant had submitted that the word "network" is understood by the relevant public as being the plural of "channel" and that therefore "Food Channel" and "Food Network" will not be distinguished in the marketplace. The delegate observed that she was aware that there were various entities in the television industry within Australia which used a naming convention for both the overall television network and individual channels within that network. However the delegate was satisfied from her own knowledge of the Australian television market that the public understanding of the relationship between the names is as a result of exposure over time to the naming convention, rather than the result of an inherent equivalence in terminology. Although the delegate understood that most television networks in the Australian market involved several related channels, she was not satisfied that at this stage, and failing an educative process of the public whereby the public came to recognise that a television network as comprising individual television channels, that the terms were the same. Accordingly the delegate did not consider the trade marks, when viewed as wholes, as being deceptively similar (at [21]-[23]); the delegate was satisfied that the market for "printed matter, periodical publications, books and newspapers; paper and cardboard articles; posters, calendars; writing instruments, pencils, pens, stationery, writing pads, greeting cards; photographs", being goods within class 16, is separate from that of the television broadcasting and television entertainment markets (at [24]); the delegate noted that within the applicant's service claims in class 41 in respect of registrations 881666 and 881667 was the item "publication of printed publications." The delegate referred to Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) v Caterpillar Tractor Co [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511 where Lockhart J had considered service marks and the problems of confusion with goods marks. The delegate considered that publication services are closely related to the results of those services, namely printed publications, be they books, leaflets, newspapers or newsletters, and that the presence of those goods within the specification was sufficient to trigger the particular provision of s 44 which deals with goods and services. Accordingly, the delegate was satisfied that some of the applicant's claimed services, namely the "publication of printed publications", were closely related to some of the respondent's goods, namely "printed publications, periodical publications, books and newspapers" (at [25]-[26]). Issues in contention

First, I reject the respondent's contention that, because the applicant's trade mark is registered for services and trade mark 967804 relates to goods, s 44(1) is not relevant. Section 44(1) clearly contemplates rejection of the application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of goods , where a trade mark applicant's trade mark is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to, inter alia , a trade mark registered by another person (or sought to be registered) in respect of similar goods or closely related services . As the delegate observed, this issue was considered in some depth by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511 , particularly at 522-523. I similarly note the recognition to the possibility of deceptive similarity between a service mark and a mark in respect of closely related goods discussed in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 380.</text>

<text>In addition to the contention that, on the face of the application, the respondent is the owner of the trade mark and there is no evidence that anyone other than the respondent was ever the owner of the trade mark, the respondent also submits, in summary: At the time of the application on 28 August 2003 the owner of the trade mark was The Food Channel Pty Ltd. The applicant can apply for a trade mark even if it does not intend to use it provided it has authorised or intends to authorise another person to use it, or if it intends to assign it to another. On 15 January 2004 the application for the trade mark was formally assigned by The Food Channel Pty Ltd to the respondent (cf respondent's written submissions p 17). Mr Lawrence as the sole shareholder and managing director of The Food Channel Pty Ltd and the respondent and author of the trade mark properly authorised his companies first The Food Channel Pty Ltd and then upon assignment the respondent to use the trade mark with a licence back to The Food Channel Pty Ltd from the respondent after the assignment with the intention to use the mark on the goods being printed matter in this case printed recipes (cf respondent's written submissions p 19). "It may be fair to say Mr Lawrence sees the business as his own and sometimes confuses the distinction between himself and his companies, as might be seen from the nature of his affidavits where he defines the Respondent as the 'Food Channel' and (sic) then talks generally about the business of Food Channel meaning his business generally being himself and both of his companies. This is understandable as he is not a lawyer and it appears on the face of the affidavit that he did not have legal representation or advice at the time of drawing and filing of his main affidavit. As the sole shareholder and director of both companies he looks upon them both as his business. 
He did however obtain legal advice at the time of the assignment and formally transferred the trade mark application from The Food Channel Pty Ltd to Food Network Pty Ltd and formally lodged the assignment with the Trade Marks Office where the assignment was formally recorded, with Food Channel network as the new owner" (respondent's written submissions pp 19-20).
 In order to establish its opposition under s 58 an opponent must show that: the respective trade marks of applicant and opponent be either identical or substantially identical ( Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Limited [1994] FCA 936 ; (1994) 31 IPR 375) ; and the respective goods or services of the parties be the "same kind of thing" ( Re Hicks' Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636 ; and a person other than the applicant has the earlier claim to ownership based on use prior to both the present application to register and actual use of the trade mark by the applicant ( Settef SpA (1987) 10 IPR 402 at 413 and Re Hicks' Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636) ; the respondent contends that the applicant cannot show any of these elements and therefore must fail under s 58.</text>

<text>Second, in Renaud Cointreau v Cordon Bleu International Ltee (2001) 193 ALR 657 at [74] the Full Court, approving the observation of the primary judge in those proceedings, said that the reputation which the applicant is required to demonstrate pursuant to the equivalent of s 60 is: 
 one of which a significant or substantial number of persons were aware... What is "significant" or "substantial" will depend on the nature of the goods or services in question. For some highly specialised products, awareness among a few thousand persons, or even less, might be sufficient.</text>

<tocase>Revlon Inc v Cripps &amp; Lee Ltd [1980] FSR 85</tocase>
<text>However, the respondent relies in its written submissions on Revlon Inc v Cripps &amp; Lee Ltd [1980] FSR 85 , Polo Textile Industries v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 , Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. As the respondent has relied on these cases in the context of referring to s 27(1) of the Act, I can only infer that the respondent claims that, at the filing date, there was implied authorisation by The Food Channel Pty Ltd of the respondent to use trade mark 967804 within the meaning of s 27(1)(b)(ii). Was there implied authorisation to use?

Further, the cases cited by the respondent support the proposition that a trade mark may be a "house mark" of a corporate group, and that members of a corporate group other than the registered proprietor may have implied authority to use it (see in particular Revlon [1980] FSR 85 at 106 per Buckley LJ and Templeman LJ at 114-115 and Polo Textiles [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 at 239). In this respect these cases do not consider issues of ownership, only authorised use of a trade mark.</text>

<tocase>Settef SpA v Riv-Oland Marble Co (Vic) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 IPR 402</tocase>
<text>It is not in contention that s 27 of the Act requires that there be, inter alia , use of the trade mark "in relation to the goods and/or services." As Mansfield J observed in Philmac Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1551 ; (2002) 126 FCR 525 at 539-540 it is necessary that the trade mark applicant was using or intended to use the trade mark as a trade mark. Whether a trade mark is used as a trade mark is judged objectively ( Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 438 ; (2004) 61 IPR 242 at 248-249). Thus, for example, there is authority that preliminary discussions and negotiations about whether the mark should be used ( Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414) , forwarding of samples or brochures in order ascertain whether there is a market for the relevant goods or services (cf Settef SpA v Riv-Oland Marble Co (Vic) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 IPR 402 at 417-418), and distribution of a product free of charge (cf re Ferodo Ltd's Application (1945) 62 RPC 111) do not constitute "use" of a trade mark as contemplated by the legislation.

The respondent submitted that giving away recipes could constitute use of a trade mark in trade or commerce and relied on findings of Drummond J in Oakley, Inc v Franchise China Pty Ltd ACN 080 032 604 (2003) 58 IPR 452 , in particular at [30] where his Honour said: 
 That marked goods are supplied free of charge does not necessarily mean that the mark is not being used in the course of trade. That is shown by the free sample cases, such as Settef . The Irish Supreme Court, in Golden Pages Trade Mark [1985] FSR 27 , held that marked classified telephone directories distributed by the Post Office free of charge to telephone subscribers involved use of the mark by the directory publisher "in the course of trade": the publisher engaged in this activity to earn income from the sale to traders of advertising in the directory... Golden Pages was referred to with approval by Whitford J in "Visa" Trade Mark (1985) 102 RPC 323. I consider it correctly states the law.

While it is not in contention that use of a trade mark on free trade samples may be trade mark use in relation to those goods, the applicant submits that the evidence does not disclose use of the trade mark in relation to goods and services within class 16 and that the respondent's reliance upon Oakley (2003) 58 IPR 452 in this context is misplaced. I agree. "Use" of trade mark 967804 by the original trade mark applicant, The Food Channel Pty Ltd, in the sense that the trade mark has been applied to written documents such as menus or recipes used in relation to catering services (which would be registrable in class 43) or free gifts in the promotion of, for example, meat (which are goods registrable in class 29), is not use in the sense of trade or dealing in relation to these documents. None of these uses appear to be with respect to "printed publications" within class 16 in relation to which application for registration of the trade mark was made. I do not consider that the respondent has demonstrated use by The Food Channel Pty Ltd, which was the trade mark applicant of trade mark 967804, as a trade mark so as to establish ownership through use. The respondent's case - relationship of Mr Lawrence, the respondent and The Food Channel Pty Ltd

In addition to the contention that, on the face of the application, the respondent is the owner of the trade mark and there is no evidence that anyone other than the respondent was ever the owner of the trade mark, the respondent also submits, in summary: At the time of the application on 28 August 2003 the owner of the trade mark was The Food Channel Pty Ltd. The applicant can apply for a trade mark even if it does not intend to use it provided it has authorised or intends to authorise another person to use it, or if it intends to assign it to another. On 15 January 2004 the application for the trade mark was formally assigned by The Food Channel Pty Ltd to the respondent (cf respondent's written submissions p 17). Mr Lawrence as the sole shareholder and managing director of The Food Channel Pty Ltd and the respondent and author of the trade mark properly authorised his companies first The Food Channel Pty Ltd and then upon assignment the respondent to use the trade mark with a licence back to The Food Channel Pty Ltd from the respondent after the assignment with the intention to use the mark on the goods being printed matter in this case printed recipes (cf respondent's written submissions p 19).

This is understandable as he is not a lawyer and it appears on the face of the affidavit that he did not have legal representation or advice at the time of drawing and filing of his main affidavit.

<text>It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008)). As Finkelstein J observed in Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [25]: 
 In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: In Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1886) 32 ChD 311 , 319; Seven-Up Co v O T Ltd [1947] HCA 56 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 , 626. Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 citing Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202. A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia , at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.</text>

<tocase>Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592</tocase>
<text>Section 44(1) was considered in considerable detail by the delegate in her decision. In summary, the delegate found as follows: the applicant's trade marks have earlier priority dates than that of the respondent (at [18]); principles applicable to the operation of s 44 can be found in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 594-595 (at [20]); the applicant had submitted that the word "network" is understood by the relevant public as being the plural of "channel" and that therefore "Food Channel" and "Food Network" will not be distinguished in the marketplace. The delegate observed that she was aware that there were various entities in the television industry within Australia which used a naming convention for both the overall television network and individual channels within that network. However the delegate was satisfied from her own knowledge of the Australian television market that the public understanding of the relationship between the names is as a result of exposure over time to the naming convention, rather than the result of an inherent equivalence in terminology. Although the delegate understood that most television networks in the Australian market involved several related channels, she was not satisfied that at this stage, and failing an educative process of the public whereby the public came to recognise that a television network as comprising individual television channels, that the terms were the same. Accordingly the delegate did not consider the trade marks, when viewed as wholes, as being deceptively similar (at [21]-[23]); the delegate was satisfied that the market for "printed matter, periodical publications, books and newspapers; paper and cardboard articles; posters, calendars; writing instruments, pencils, pens, stationery, writing pads, greeting cards; photographs", being goods within class 16, is separate from that of the television broadcasting and television entertainment markets (at [24]); the delegate noted that within the applicant's service claims in class 41 in respect of registrations 881666 and 881667 was the item "publication of printed publications." The delegate referred to Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) v Caterpillar Tractor Co [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 48 ALR 511 where Lockhart J had considered service marks and the problems of confusion with goods marks. The delegate considered that publication services are closely related to the results of those services, namely printed publications, be they books, leaflets, newspapers or newsletters, and that the presence of those goods within the specification was sufficient to trigger the particular provision of s 44 which deals with goods and services. Accordingly, the delegate was satisfied that some of the applicant's claimed services, namely the "publication of printed publications", were closely related to some of the respondent's goods, namely "printed publications, periodical publications, books and newspapers" (at [25]-[26]).

<text>It is clear from the cases that the date on which it is necessary for the applicant to show that it is the owner of the relevant trade mark is the date of filing the application (in this case, a date which is also the priority date as defined by s 12) , because it is based on the state of facts existing at that date that the title of a trade mark to registration is determined: The Seven Up Company v O.T.

<text>It is clear from the cases that the date on which it is necessary for the applicant to show that it is the owner of the relevant trade mark is the date of filing the application (in this case, a date which is also the priority date as defined by s 12) , because it is based on the state of facts existing at that date that the title of a trade mark to registration is determined: The Seven Up Company v O.T.

As a general proposition, it may be inferred that, by the act of filing an application for registration of a trade mark, the applicant claims "ownership" of the trade mark for the purposes of s 58. As Dixon J observed in The Shell Company of Australia Ltd [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 627-628: 
 But, however that may be, it is clear enough from the course of legislation and of decision that an application to register a trade mark so far unused must, equally with a trade mark the title to which depends on prior user, be founded on proprietorship. The basis of a claim to proprietorship in a trade mark so far unused has been found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark, the intention to use it upon or in connection with the goods and the applying for registration.

It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008)). As Finkelstein J observed in Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [25]: 
 In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: In Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1886) 32 ChD 311 , 319; Seven-Up Co v O T Ltd [1947] HCA 56 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 , 626. Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 citing Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202. A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia , at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/901.html</AustLII>
<text>It is also clear from the cases that ownership of a trade mark can vest in another without formal assignment, for example in a corporate alter ego of the creator of the trade mark. Examples of the application of this principle are Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. I shall consider these cases later in this judgment.

However, the respondent relies in its written submissions on Revlon Inc v Cripps &amp; Lee Ltd [1980] FSR 85 , Polo Textile Industries v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227 , Crazy Ron's [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 209 ALR 1 and Torpedoes [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318. As the respondent has relied on these cases in the context of referring to s 27(1) of the Act, I can only infer that the respondent claims that, at the filing date, there was implied authorisation by The Food Channel Pty Ltd of the respondent to use trade mark 967804 within the meaning of s 27(1)(b)(ii). Was there implied authorisation to use?

The cases cited by the respondent support the proposition that a person may be impliedly vested with ownership by the original owner of a trade mark such as, for example, as a parent company causing a subsidiary to apply for ownership. So, for example, in Torpedoes Sportswear [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318 while the relevant trade mark was originally owned by Mr Thorpe, it was not in contention that it was registered, with his authority, in the name of a company under his control, and that that company was the "owner" of the trade mark within the meaning of the Act. However ownership impliedly vested and resulting in an application for registration by the person so vested (which would satisfy s 58) should not be confused with an implied intention of a registered owner to authorise use of the trade mark by related parties (which is relevant under s 27(1)(b)(ii)). They are distinct concepts.</text>

<tocase>Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315</tocase>
<text>Section 52 Trade Practices Act , provides that a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. It is ordinarily necessary for a party claiming breach of s 52 to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court the nature of the alleged conduct and the circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading: Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318. Principles relevant to consideration of claimed breach of s 52 include the following:

In these proceedings the evidence clearly shows that the applicant is a television programming network, web site and publisher specialising in the subject of food, and that it distributes internationally television programmes focussing on the subject of food. The evidence before the Court as to the activities of the respondent reveals that it is a company with one shareholder and one director (Mr Lawrence), and that its activities have included distribution of free recipes, menus and leaflets to promote, inter alia , the sale of meat. I consider it very likely that, while there could be a transitory association between the products of the applicant and the respondent in the mind of a member of the public, the brief association would be quickly dispelled on closer association with the products. In any event, as I have observed, no submissions have been put to the Court to substantiate a case pursuant to s 52 Trade Practices Act in the terms which I have outlined (or otherwise), and no evidence put to the Court to support such a case.
