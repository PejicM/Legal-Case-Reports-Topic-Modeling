<text>Section 601FC(2) requires other definitions in the Act to be looked at. The Act does not define a "scheme". As Keane JA noted in Mier v FN Management Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 408 ; [2006] 1 Qd R 339 at 350 (fn 29), the phrase "program or plan of action" has been adopted by various courts as the conventional meaning of the word "scheme": see Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW); ex rel Corporate Affairs Commission [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 , 129; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 170 FLR 388 , 393; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v West [2008] SASC 111 ; (2008) 100 SASR 496 , 529. The Act however does define a "managed investment scheme": s 9. That definition is important. It defines, so far as is presently relevant, a managed investment scheme as: 
(a) a scheme that has the following features: 
 
 
(i) people contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not); 
 
 
(ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders);
 
 
 (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions); or

<text>The consequence, as noted by Keane JA in Mier at 350 1, is that s 601FC(2) does not necessarily apply to all property held by a responsible entity or used in the operation of the scheme: see also Hance v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCAFC 196 , [95] [100]. It operates in connection with scheme property as that term is defined in s 9 of the Act.</text>

As Keane JA went on to say in Mier at 350: 
It follows that, if property is to be considered "scheme property", the property in question must have been contributed to the scheme or must have been obtained in connection with such contributions. The absence of any such connection would make it doubtful that the property was really part of, or subject to, the scheme.

The consequence, as noted by Keane JA in Mier at 350 1, is that s 601FC(2) does not necessarily apply to all property held by a responsible entity or used in the operation of the scheme: see also Hance v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCAFC 196 , [95] [100]. It operates in connection with scheme property as that term is defined in s 9 of the Act.</text>

<text>Pt 5C.2 of the Act provides the legislative framework for managed investment schemes. One of the critical provisions is s 601FC(2).
