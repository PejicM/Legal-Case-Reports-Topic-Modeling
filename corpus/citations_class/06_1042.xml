<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>The first issue was the factor of expiration of eight years since her Honour's decision was handed down in this Court, which was acknowledged by counsel for the applicant to be 'an extraordinarily long time'. Discussion was undertaken by the parties of the implications of the Full Federal Court decision in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 made on 4 November 1986, where it was held by a Full Federal Court (Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ) that an extension of time should be granted in the context of that litigation, and in relation to which, because of a misunderstanding on the part of the solicitor for the intending appellant as to the date of delivery of the judgment sought to be appealed, the notice of appeal was filed and served on the day next following the last day limited by the Federal Court Rules for appeal. The Federal Court Rules then required, and still do, the establishment of 'special reasons' for leave to file and serve an appeal outside the requisite period of 21 days (Order 52 Rule 15). In the joint judgment of the Full Court at 195-196 in Jess , the following appears: 
 
 'What is needed to justify an extension of time... is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days... the expression "special reasons" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which is the time twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think that the use of the expression "for special reasons" implies something narrower than this. 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 In the circumstances of the present case... we formed the view that there were plainly special reasons which justified the making of the order sought.'

The special reasons sought here to be so established by the applicant were purportedly founded upon the history of the steps which were taken by him up to the time of the hearing before O'Connor J back in June 1998. In any event, it was conceded by counsel for the applicant that the principle of Anshun estoppel may apply, but it was contended nevertheless that there were special circumstances in this case which would permit me to exercise my discretion to allow the matter to proceed, including the asserted circumstances that '[t]he applicant did not have legal representation at the hearing' before her Honour, at least for the reason that he 'could not afford legal representation', and further that there will be 'no disadvantage to the Minister from the re-agitation of these matters'.

The second issue raised and sought to be addressed by the applicant related to the explanation for the delay. The applicant explained that at all times since June 1998, he had been involved in court proceedings for the purpose of challenging the decision of the Tribunal of 30 December 1997, and asserted that he had not delayed in progressing the court proceedings, although each proceeding has taken a long time to resolve due to factors beyond his control.

I have not been presented with '... something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave' , within the dicta cited in Jess , in order to appeal the decision of O'Connor J. The applicant's delay in applying for leave to appeal the decision of O'Connor J has been very lengthy in scope, falling of course just short of eight years. Moreover it is not without significance that the applicant decided in any event to pursue what the applicant evidently preferred or at least chose as another avenue of perceived redress by way of class action in another superior court of record. The pursuit of that other avenue having ultimately failed, I am unable to accept that there remains any viable alternative appellate redress, by way of resort to an application for an extension of time to appeal the judgment of this Court delivered virtually eight years ago. In my opinion, no special reason has been made out for leave to appeal the judgment of O'Connor J delivered on 10 June 1998, at least for the reason I have just indicted. Moreover and in any event, I have been unable to distil any conceivable error of law appearing in her Honour's reasons for judgment that might conceivably offer a viable prospect of success on any appeal, if leave for that purpose was to be granted.

The present application for an extension of time must therefore be dismissed. 


 I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

<tocase>S1174 of 2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 289</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/289.html</AustLII>
<text>In support of the contention of counsel for the applicant on the issue of delay, I was referred to his involvement in the Muin and Lie class action, and the circumstance that in February 2004, in the context of proceedings S1174 of 2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 289 , Emmett J found at [29]-[30] as follows: 
 
 
 '29. The second possible matter of prejudice was a concern that delay might be advanced as an answer to any claim for relief. The Minister has assured the Court that she will not make a submission in any future proceeding that there is no satisfactory explanation for the applicant's delay, from the time when the applicant was joined as a representative party in the High Court, to the time of refusal of an order nisi. Any delay from the time of the making of a decision by the Tribunal and the joinder of the applicant in the High Court proceeding would still remain to be explained, so would any delay from the time of refusal of an order nisi until the commencement of any fresh proceeding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 30. I do not consider that there would be any prejudice to the applicant or to any of the other applicants by the refusal of an order nisi. No such refusal would stand in the way of successful prosecution of any subsequent application for prerogative writ relief if properly commenced and particularised.'

The applicant contended on that footing that 'this assurance given by the Minister's solicitor' applies in the present case. The Minister's response was that account needs to be taken of the context of the Minister's assurance, being the existence of about 700 applications for order nisi remitted from the High Court to the Federal Court in S1174 of 2002. The Minister submitted that 'the assurance that no submission would be made in any future proceedings that there was no satisfactory explanation for the applicant's delay from the time when the applicant was joined as a representative party in the High Court to the time of his Honour's judgment, was in respect of future first instance proceedings brought challenging the Tribunal's decision'.

Assuming the foregoing explanations concerning involvement in the class action have some discrete basis in merit, the fact remains that the applicant's engagement in the class action occurred in the context of the unfavourable decision already entered against him by O'Connor J, and for whatever reasons of his own, he chose to leave the adverse findings by her Honour unchallenged by way of appeal, and to pursue whatever refugee status he might have in the context of that class action.</text>

<tocase>Rajaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2000) 62 ALD 73</tocase>
<text>Further as to that first ground for review, the applicant referred to Rajaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 62 ALD 73 at [42]-[50], where a Full Federal Court was said by the applicant to have recognised that extortion may have dual motivations, one of which may be Convention based and the other not so. The applicant asserted that there was evidence that people such as the applicant may be targeted in the manner complained of, both because they have money and because they belong to a minority religion. By way of asserted illustration, the applicant pointed to the testimony of a witness that the applicant was '... at risk of being kidnapped and possibly killed if he returned to Bangladesh', and all that at the hands of 'people wanting money' because he 'belongs to a minority religion'. However the applicant acknowledged that he had testified by his statement to the Tribunal to the effect that he did not think he would have been kidnapped if he was not perceived as having money, but that so much did not derogate from the circumstance that people in his position were targeted in Bangladesh because they are 'perceived as having money', and also because they 'belong to minority religions'. It was contended by the applicant that the failure of the Tribunal to recognise that dual motivation gave rise to jurisdictional error on the Tribunal's part.

It was contended by the applicant that Raphael FM 'saw some merit in the grounds [of appeal] in light of the decisions of the High Court in Ibrahim , and earlier in the Full Court in Rajaratnam , both of which decisions were of course handed down after O'Connor J's decision in June 1998. I was referred to the reasons for decision of Raphael FM in particular at [17], where the following appears: 
 
 'It may not be impossible for the applicant to obtain leave from the Full Bench of the Federal Court to appeal against her Honour's decision and to argue in that appeal that in the light of subsequent authorities her Honour may have been in error.' 
 

The expression ' may not be impossible ' hardly reflects a positive view as to existence of discernible merit. In any event the applicant contended that if I was to be '... uncertain whether or not to grant an extension of time, an intermediate position would be to allow the matter to proceed to a hearing before the Full Court on both the application for extension of time to appeal and the appeal'.

There is considerable force in the Commissioner's contention that the combination of the factors of lengthy delay unexplained at least satisfactorily, together with an absence of demonstration of reasonable good prospects of success, should weigh sufficiently heavily against the applicant's application for an extension of time to appeal the decision of O'Connor J back in June 1998. Those proceedings constituted of course an attempted review of a Tribunal decision made on 30 December 1997 which was unsuccessful in the Federal Court.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Haji Ibrahim [2000] HCA 55 ; (2000) 204 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/55.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant placed reliance in the context of this second ground upon the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Haji Ibrahim [2000] HCA 55 ; (2000) 204 CLR 1, which was said to stand as authority for the principle that persecution did not require 'systematic conduct' ; I was referred in that regard to the reasons for judgment of Gleeson CJ at [5], Gaudron J at [33], McHugh J at [99]-[101], Gummow J at [133]-[135], Kirby J at [193]-[194] and Callinan at [221]-[225]. The observation of McHugh J, who gave one of the two High Court judgments in favour of the putative but unsuccessful (in the view of the majority) refugee, spoke of that non-statutory notion as importing the idea of non-random. I am unable to identify in any event any viable issue arising in the context of the proceedings concerning any such non-statutory notion, much less any basis reflecting likelihood of error in relation to the foregoing finding of the Tribunal below, and no such error has been identified by the applicant.</text>

<tocase>Kalaba, Lazar v The Queen [1996] FCA 908</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1996/908.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant referred to the unreported decision of Finn J in Kalaba, Lazar v the Queen [1996] FCA 908 where his Honour indicated what he considered to be the governing principle in the case of delay: 
 
 'For present purposes the approach I intend to take is that adopted... in Jones v The Queens and to ask: first, are the reasons the applicant has advanced for his delay sufficient to excuse or at least to explain his delay so as to justify allowing him to institute an appeal out of time? Secondly, has the applicant demonstrated that his appeal may have sufficient prospect of success to make it just that he should now be allowed to proceed with it?'

The applicant also referred to the 'long time' it has taken 'each proceedings to resolve due to factors beyond his control', but I am unable to accord significance thereto in terms of it being a circumstance that would amount to a 'special reason' within Order 52 Rule 15(1) , it having been the applicant's implicit choice to pursue that purported perceived avenue of review of the Tribunal decision of 30 December 1997 rather than seek to appeal O'Connor J's longstanding decision.

The third issue raised by the applicant concerned his prospects of success on the appeal by way of application for review of the decision of O'Connor J back on 10 June 1998. The applicant asserted that two grounds for review had been propounded to Raphael FM below, which I will now record and discuss.</text>
