<tocase>Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Co (1996) 137 ALR 498</tocase>
<text>6 The applicant has filed a notice of appeal, appealing against the judgment and orders made by Jessup J. In due course that appeal will proceed to an appellate hearing subject to any other orders that might be made in the usual course of the preparation of an appeal. The general principle which is applied in the Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders. Whether or not such a stay should be granted depends upon whether the Court or a Judge thinks in all the circumstances that the matter is an appropriate case for the grant of a stay. See, for example, Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Co (1996) 137 ALR 498.

7 The application for the stay is made in respect of all the orders made by Jessup J but, as I understand it, particularly in respect of order number 4. In respect of the first three orders there is not, so far as the applicant is concerned, anything to stay which might impact upon her.

8 The first order is that, to the extent not previously dealt with by the Court, the applicant's motion is dismissed. There is no point in staying that order if the applicant is dissatisfied with that order. The proper process is to appeal against it and that she has done.</text>
