<tocase>Guo v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 64 FCR 151</tocase>
<text>The Appellant contended that when explaining her case to the Tribunal she was " nervous ". Given the importance to her of the claim that she was making, so much may be expected. Indeed, it is important to constantly recall the difficult circumstances in which applicants for refugee status are called upon to give an account of their circumstances: Taylor S, "Informational Deficiencies Affecting Refugee Status Determinations: Sources and Solutions" (1994) 13 U Tas LR 43. In Guo v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 64 FCR 151 at 194, Foster J also helpfully gave the following reminder: 
 
 It is well to remember that self-contradictory statements and apparent evasiveness, although of obvious importance, do not necessarily require a conclusion that the witness is being untruthful in those aspects of his or her evidence or, more significantly, that the whole of his or her evidence should be rejected. 
 

 
In the case at hand, the Tribunal has carefully set forth the claims being advanced by the now Appellant and has made findings of fact by reference to the materials before it. In such a context, those findings are findings for the Tribunal alone and not this Court: cf Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 552 and 559. Such findings are findings of fact falling far short of jurisdictional error: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67], 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J.</text>

<tocase>SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 , 232 CLR 189</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/35.html</AustLII>
<text>Ground 2, for example, alleges a failure to " afford procedural fairness ". Section 422B of the Migration Act provides that Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act " is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with ". See: SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 at [48] , [2007] HCA 35 ; 232 CLR 189. One of those requirements is the obligation imposed by s 425 to invite a person seeking review " to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review ". But the manner in which it is said that the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness in the present proceeding was not explained and was not readily apparent. The Appellant, for example, appeared before the Tribunal to give evidence and to present her arguments during the course of a hearing held on 20 March 2009. Prior to that, the Tribunal had written to the Appellant pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act on 23 February 2009. The Appellant's representative wrote to the Tribunal on 7 March 2009 and forwarded a further submission on 15 March 2009. A yet further submission was received on 19 March 2009.

When reference is made in Ground 3 to the " relevant considerations or integers central " to the claims being advanced, the " integers " are not further identified. Nor has there been any identification of the manner in which the Tribunal " failed to consider " the claims being advanced or was otherwise " preoccupied " for the purposes of Grounds 4 and 5. There is no evidence that the Tribunal was " preoccupied " and the detailed elaboration of the claims being advanced and the manner in which they were resolved belie any conclusion other than a conclusion that the Tribunal discharged the functions entrusted to it in a careful and measured fashion. Nor was there any elaboration of the manner in which Grounds 6, 7 and 8 were sought to be advanced.

Grounds 2 to 8 of the Notice of Appeal (inclusive) are rejected.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/729.html</AustLII>
<text>An application for review by the Federal Magistrates Court was then filed and in February 2009 that Court quashed the Tribunal's decision by consent. A differently constituted Tribunal thereafter conducted a further review and on 24 March 2009 again affirmed the decision not to grant the protection visa. On 5 August 2009 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the March 2009 decision of the Tribunal: SZKOO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 729.

On 26 August 2009 the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court.

The Appellant appeared before the Court unrepresented, although she did have the assistance of an interpreter.</text>
