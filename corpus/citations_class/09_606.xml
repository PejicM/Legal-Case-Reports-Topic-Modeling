<text>This passage refers to what appears to be the competitor's get-up. It was referred to with approval by a Full Court of this Court in Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 361 at 371 per Beaumont, Branson and Lindgren JJ. However, I do not think that too much should be read into that for three reasons. First , it is apparent that in Reckitt Lord Oliver was only restating a test he had formulated two pages before at 17 IPR 7. That more detailed formulation of the test makes plain that the question is whether the defendant has made a representation to the public, not whether it has a get-up. Secondly , the Full Court in Vieright referred to both passages with approval: 31 IPR 361 at 369, 371. Thirdly , several other Full Courts have referred with approval to Lord Oliver's first formulation of the test which lacks the reference to the respondent's get-up: TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc (1999) 45 IPR 43 at 50 [25] per Wilcox, Kiefel and Emmett JJ; Conagra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 327 per Lockhart J, 355 per Gummow J and 361 per French J. In those circumstances, neither authority nor common sense require the identification of the Malt Balls get-up which, so it seems to me, is a sterile exercise the resolution of which will confer no benefit on anyone.

<tocase>Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 212</tocase>
<text>In this area it is impermissible to take into account any matter added to the respondent's mark or any differences in get-up. The marks must be understood in their entirety. Both parties placed reliance upon the reasons given by Lord Radcliffe in de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co (1951) 68 RPC 103 at 105-106. I will not set them out. Lord Radcliffe's reasons were examined by a Full Court of this Court in Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 212 at 231 [84]. For present purposes Crazy Ron's establishes a number of principles: The question of deceptive similarity is not to be judged by a side by side comparison. Instead what is involved is a comparison, on the one hand, of the impression based on recollection of an applicant's mark that persons of ordinary intelligence would have and the impression such persons would get from the respondent's mark (at 227 [73]). In that regard it is important to consider the "idea of the mark" (at 228 [74]). In assessing deceptive similarity, questions of aural impression may be important (at 228 [75]). In that context I regard the aural similarity between Malt Balls and Maltesers as negligible. The risk of deception must be tangible but it is enough if an ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt (at 228 [76]). Allowance must be made for imperfect recollections in considering whether a mark so nearly resembles another mark that it is likely to cause confusion or deception (at 228-229 [77]-[78]). That principle extends even to marks which are not just invented words. If a registered trade mark includes words which can be regarded as an essential feature of the mark, another mark that incorporates those words may well infringe the registered trade mark (at 229-230 [79]).

It is likewise established that, generally, reputation is irrelevant to the question of infringement. Despite the apparent breath of that proposition, however, it is also accepted that if a particular word or words has come to signify exclusively the goods of the proprietor of a mark (the mark including those words) then the use of that or those words by another would be an infringement. No doubt this involves some apparent departure from the general principle that reputation is irrelevant but it is sanctioned by authority: Crazy Ron's at 232 [88]-[89]. A corollary appears to be that in assessing the notion of a consumer's imperfect recollection of a mark, the fact that a mark is notoriously so ubiquitous and of such long standing that consumers generally must be taken to be familiar with it and its use in relation to particular goods or services is a relevant consideration: Crazy Ron's at 232-233 [90].

The application of these principles is, so it seems to me, relatively straightforward. The Maltesers marks are very famous. Consumers generally must be taken to be familiar with them. That is relevant to assessing a consumer's imperfect recollection of the mark. So viewed, a comparison between the impression held in the consumer's mind and the direct impression of Sweet Rewards' mark is one which, in this case at least, occurs in a context in which the chances of the average consumer having forgotten the Maltesers mark are vanishingly small.

So too, an aural examination leads to the same result. "Maltesers" does not sound like "Malt Balls". In particular, the pronunciation is phonetically different: "mal-tesers" is syllabically distinct from "malt balls". I do not think that the colour red would cause confusion but even if there was such a risk such risk is clearly overcome by the effect of the other matters to which I have referred. My conclusions are therefore that: 
(a) the trade mark used by Sweet Rewards was the Delfi mark so that Mars' claim fails;
 
(b) even if the trade mark use by Sweet Rewards were as Mars alleges, consumers are so familiar with Maltesers that they could not possibly be confused by the Malt Balls packaging more formally, there is no likelihood of imperfect recollection by them of the Maltesers mark leading to confusion; and
 
(c) that conclusion is assisted by an aural consideration.
 Disposition

It follows that none of the applicant's claims have been made good. The application should be dismissed with costs. Rulings on evidence

Objection was taken by Sweet Rewards to paragraph 8 of the affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong sworn 29 May 2008 and to exhibit SJA-2 to that affidavit on the grounds of hearsay. Ms Armstrong had given evidence of certain discussions she had with various retailers about the distribution of the Delfi products. The purpose of that evidence was to show that the reputation of the Delfi range was limited.</text>

<tocase>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1987) 10 IPR 21</tocase>
<text>The identification of a trade reputation and the discernment of the features of a product in which that reputation inheres may be proved in a number of ways. In Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Bordern Inc (1987) 10 IPR 21 Walton J received detailed evidence about the reputation and get-up of Jif lemon juice. That material consisted of evidence from brand specialists as well as evidence about the reactions of randomly selected shoppers to the brands in question.

In this case the evidence about the reputation of Maltesers and the elements of the packaging in which that reputation was said to inhere was more indirect. It came principally from Mr West who gave evidence for Mars. Mr West is the general manager of Mars Snackfood Australia which is the division within Mars responsible for its business of manufacturing, distributing, marketing and selling snack foods in Australia. In this context, snack food means chocolate confectionary. Mr West has an extensive background in the marketing of such items. He gave evidence about the manner in which the Maltesers products have been marketed. However, this evidence was of little assistance in determining which elements of the Maltesers packaging were the ones that, in the public mind, had a reputation.

Mr West did give evidence that the manner in which the Maltesers products were marketed was strictly controlled which suggests, at least, that Mars believes a reputation inheres in the packaging. He referred to a document generated within the Mars group which provided very precise guidelines on the use of the Maltesers brand. This document, entitled "Maltesers Guidelines", was prepared in consultation with Mars' advertising agencies, Brandhouse WTS, AMV BBDO, One Graphics and De Schutter. I would infer from its provenance that it was prepared by experts in the business of branding confectionaries. It referred to a concept of the Maltesers "brand flag". This was said to consist of five elements: 
(a) the "Logotype", consisting of the word Maltesers written stylistically from bottom left to top right and receding;
 
(b) six Maltesers balls, five being whole and one half shot;
 
(c) "the magic" being a small sparkling motif towards the bottom right of the packet;
 
(d) the shadows, being shadows beneath the Maltesers word and one or more of the balls and apparently cast by them; and
 
(e) the background, being the red background.

The guidelines identified the "main constituent element" of the brand flag as the logotype with its shadow that is, the word Maltesers apparently suspended in the air and proceeding cursively from the bottom left to the receding top right. The guidelines permitted the angle on which the logotype hung to vary slightly but did not permit any variation from the general structure.

Mr West was cross-examined about the significance of these branding matters. He conceded that the "magic" was of no importance. Mr West also gave evidence, which I accept, in these terms: 
What did you mean by packaging design? --- Yes, so I would say chocolate confectionary, unlike sugar confectionary, most brands are defined by their product form or shape so, you know, if you think of if someone says M&amp;Ms you know the shape of an M&amp;M or if it's Maltesers the shape of the Malteser and so within this, you know, I think Maltesers has built the reputation of having the combination which is the brand name, the red packaging but also the product depiction and you could take the product out and put it in front of people and they all say that's a Malteser and then when they see it in the combination of the red and the product they depict it as Maltesers.

<text>Despite that, there is some support for the idea that the identification of a respondent's get-up might be a useful endeavour. In Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 Lord Oliver restated (at 8) his previous explication of the relevant test in terms which included this statement: 
(2) If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, does the get-up under which the appellants proposed to market their lemon juice in all or any of the Mark I, Mark II or Mark III versions amount to a representation by the appellants that the juice which they sell is Jif lemon juice?</text>
