<text>1 This appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZKJI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1998) refusing relief in relation to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) came on for hearing before me on 28 May last. The appellant is unrepresented. The only point of substance which appeared to me to arise out of the appellant's case was an argument that s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) had not been complied with. The appellant had been afforded a hearing by the Tribunal member then constituting the Tribunal. Following that hearing, the Tribunal was reconstituted and another member substituted. That Tribunal member refused the appellant's request for a hearing. The appellant, in addition to making a general request, had made particular criticisms of the manner in which the previous hearing had been conducted. Counsel for the first respondent submitted that, although some divergence had emerged between various single judge decisions about the application of s 425 , the circumstances of this case were, so far as is relevant, indistinguishable from those the subject of the Full Court decision in Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1362 ; (2001) 113 FCR 541 and the appeal was bound to fail.</text>
