<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/6.html</AustLII>
<text>Before considering the substance of the applicant's claims, it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings. In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684 Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:- 
 ...the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution. Generally speaking, it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard. 

 
Similarly, Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of ' re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court ', nor ' because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put '.

While such authority refers to a basis for reviewing an earlier decision where the Court, still possessing jurisdiction in a proceeding, later considers its decision to be erroneous, this Court considers that the principle referred to in Autodesk and McMullin applies generally and should guide this Court in the present circumstances. Is forfeiture dependent upon conviction or commission of a criminal offence?</text>

<tocase>Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427</tocase>
<text>The applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215 in which the Court at 221-222 considered the meaning of the word 'contravention'. Additionally, the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies: see Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438.

The applicant also relied upon the rule of construction that dispossession of a valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to Parliament unless expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning: see Coco v R at 437-438. The applicant submits that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A of the Migration Act should be construed narrowly and confined, in accordance with the Second Reading speech of the Act inserting s 261A into the Migration Act , to those cases where forfeiture of the vessel occurs as a penalty in relation to 'people smuggling' criminal offences and not in respect of those instances where persons seek asylum.</text>

<tocase>Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446</tocase>
<text>In answer to the applicant's submissions lie the words used in s 261A of the Migration Act . The words providing for the forfeiture are clear and unequivocal. The principles relied upon by the Commonwealth concerning forfeiture of property are not in contest, and the concept is clearly recognised: see for example Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446. In that decision the Court upheld the validity of a forfeiture of an aircraft which was involved in the carriage of cannabis resin, even though the owners of the aircraft were unaware of that fact. Whilst the law providing for forfeiture may appear harsh, that is the necessary consequence of its operation regarding property rights.

In the present circumstances forfeiture occurred when the vessel was used or involved in a ' contravention of this Act '. Such contravention occurred by the bringing in or coming into Australia of one or more persons who were or became unlawful non-citizens, contrary to s 42 of the Migration Act . The text of s 261A of the Migration Act is unambiguous. In these circumstances the authorities relied upon by the applicant have no scope for application. The Refugee Convention</text>

<tocase>Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215</tocase>
<text>The applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215 in which the Court at 221-222 considered the meaning of the word 'contravention'. Additionally, the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies: see Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438.

The applicant relies upon the decision of Dimella Constructions , in which the Court was asked whether s 21(5) of the Builder's Licensing Act 1967 (SA) would apply to a builder even if a charge under ss 21(2) or (11) could be defended by the common law defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Section 21(5) stated that: 
 Where a person has carried out or undertaken, or submitted a bid or tender, to carry out any building work in contravention of this section, he shall not be entitled to claim, or recover in any court, the amount of any fee or charge for any building work... 

Section 21(2) imposed a penalty on a person who held himself or herself out as having a building licence without having a licence and s 21(11) imposed a penalty for constructing a building for a fee without a licence. The conduct of the charged party satisfied the descriptions of such offences, but the Court found that he was adequately protected by the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact because he believed himself to be licensed.

Bray CJ (with other judges agreeing) found at page 221 that: 
 I think a man does not transgress a law if he is legally innocent of breaking it and entitled to acquittal if charged with a breach of it, nor, in such circumstances, does he go counter to it or come into conflict with it.

At 222, Bray CJ concluded: 
 If it is a characteristic of any contravention that it could result in a penalty after conviction for a punishable offence, then e converso when there can be no penalty, because there can be no convention because there is no punishable offence, there is no contravention.

The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with"' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK).

In view of the applicant's further submissions, the decision in Dimella Constructions and the preceding discussion, the Court finds itself unable to ignore the judicial findings which have had the result that all those charged with offences under the Migration Act have been acquitted. Contravention may not always equate to a criminal offence. However, due to the structure of the Criminal Code it must follow that a failure to find criminal responsibility must also lead to finding that a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Migration Act creating offences does not exist.

The defence upon which the acquittals or discontinuances of the charges against the applicant and others was based, namely sudden or extraordinary emergency as provided by s 10.3 of the Criminal Code , applies equally to any offence with which the applicant or any other person on board the ship could be charged. As has been stated, the relevant question is whether the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that a contravention of the Migration Act has occurred. The Court can no longer be so satisfied that contraventions have occurred in respect of any offences under the Migration Act . Contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act</text>

<text>The common law defence of necessity, from which the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency in s 10.3 of the Criminal Code has its origins, has been seen as a defence both of excuse and of justification: see, for example, R v Loughnan [1981] VR 443 which proceeded upon the assumption that such defence was an excuse and In Re A (children) (conjoined twins: surgical separation) [2000] EWCA Civ 254 ; [2001] 2 WLR 480 in which Lord Brooke treated the defence of necessity as a justification. Unfortunately the history of the defence provides little firm guidance so resort must be had to the Criminal Code itself to discern whether one will still contravene an offence provision even if a defence is available.</text>

<text>For the reasons in Tran No. 1 at [50]-[54] the Court reiterates that no compensation is payable since s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution does not operate in respect of the forfeiture. The ship was validly forfeited. No question of payment of compensation arises where the forfeiture results from the incidental exercise of power under the Migration Act since s 51(xxxi) ' applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms ': see Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513 per Gummow J at 595; see authorities referred to in Tran No. 1 at [51]-[53]; see also Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty.

<tocase>NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/6.html</AustLII>
<text>It was submitted by the applicant that by virtue of Australia being a signatory to the Refugee Convention and following from the judgment of Kirby J in NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161 at [89] , the Court ought to read s 261A in a way which conforms with Australia's international obligations and should not be read to punish refugees. There are two primary problems with this submission.

As the Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ found (at [15]) in NAGV , 
 ...the Convention is an example of a treaty which qualifies what under classical international law theory was the freedom of States in the treatment of their nationals; but the Convention does not have the effect of conferring upon the refugees to which it applies international legal personality with capacity to act outside municipal legal systems. [footnotes omitted] 

 
Crucially, their Honours said at [17], 
 
 ...Gibbs CJ and Brennan J in Mayer and Stephen J in Simsek v Macphee pointed out that the determination of the status of refugee is a function left by the Convention to the competent authorities of the Contracting States which may select such procedures as they see fit for that purpose. [footnotes omitted] 

It follows that the legal concept of 'refugee' is a status which is not conferred upon a person merely by the existence of circumstances sufficient to support such a claim. This status must positively be found, and it must be found according to the standards set by the particular state, in this case, Australia. Such concept is consistent with international law only having effect within Australia by virtue of its positive adoption into municipal law. Accordingly, the passengers on the ship were not refugees until such time as they were granted that status from the Australian authorities pursuant to s 36 of the Migration Act (dealing with protection visas), and that was not until well after the facts giving rise to the contravention had occurred. At their time of entry into Australia (and thus the time when the forfeiture occurred) the ship's passengers were no more than unlawful non-citizens by force of s 14 of the Migration Act . Therefore it could not be said that forfeiture of the ship would punish the applicant as a refugee, because at the relevant time he was not a refugee, and nor was anyone else on the ship. After the fact events such as the granting of refugee status cannot affect the validity of the forfeiture.

Secondly, the passage relied upon by the applicants at [89] of NAGV states, ' where the words of a statute are susceptible to an interpretation that is consistent with international law, that construction should prevail over one that is not .' The key word is ' susceptible '. Section 36 is clearly intended to operate subsequently to s 261A because s 261A will occur automatically the moment a vessel enters Australia. There is nothing in s 261A that suggests that it should be limited in its operation by s 36 of the Migration Act so that it has no application to people to whom s 36 applies. Whether s 36 applies to an unlawful non-citizen may not be known until years after a vessel's entry in Australia, and s 261A is phrased as to operate instantaneously. Reading s 261A in the way the applicant submits completely ignores the wording of the section. It must therefore be concluded that it is not a provision which can be said to be ' susceptible ' in the manner discussed by Kirby J. Compensation</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/229.html</AustLII>
<text>In Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia and Another [2004] FCA 229 ; (2004) 136 FCR 67 at 79, French J, referring to s 106A of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) ('the FMA'), addressed the question whether a conviction for an offence was necessary before forfeiture could occur under the provisions of that section. Such section provides for the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of boats, traps and other things used in offences against various provisions of that Act. His Honour said at [79]: 
 It was contended for the applicants that before s 106A could operate to effect forfeiture of a boat or its equipment or catch it was necessary that there be a conviction for one or more of the offences upon which such forfeiture was said to arise. As a matter of construction this proposition cannot be sustained. Where there has been a conviction for an offence forfeiture can be ordered by the convicting court under s 106. Section 106A does not require any judicial determination to give effect to the forfeiture for which it provides albeit a judicial determination may be made if the occurrence of the forfeiture is contested in later proceedings. In such proceedings a civil court may make a finding whether the boat has been used in one of the specified offences. Absent the institution of such proceedings within 30 days of a notice of seizure under s 106C the asserted forfeiture will be put beyond question by operation of s 106E. That process requires no conviction to have been recorded. I reject the contention that s 106A depends for its application upon a conviction for one or more of the offences mentioned in it.</text>

<tocase>R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nt/NTSC/2000/84.html</AustLII>
<text>Despite this conclusion, the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s 42 of the Migration Act , as was found in Tran No. 1 at [48]. In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265 Angel J said at 270: 
 They intended to so enter without a visa. Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act , not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s 42 relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act. The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act, nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act. They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned, that is, to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act. 

Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84 , however, that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes. His Honour's finding in relation to s 42 is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J. As has been stated, s 261A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur. All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act , and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Pursuant to the text of s 4A of the Migration Act the defences under the Criminal Code only apply to offences under the Migration Act , and thus cannot apply to a contravention of s 42 which is not framed as an offence.</text>

<tocase>R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273</tocase>
<text>There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): 
 Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as "defences", for example, self defence is "exculpatory". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)). [Emphasis added] 

In an article published in Judicial Review entitled ' The Commonwealth Criminal Code : An Introduction to the General Principle s' the author Ian Leader-Elliot wrote:-
 
 Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not, of itself, establish guilt. Though all elements of an offence are established against a defendant, guilt may be defeated by reliance on a defence. Chapter 2 [of the Criminal Code ] adopts a binary structure in which "responsibility" is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence, combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence... There are, it should be said, significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences. [(2002) 5 Judicial Review 4 at 301] 

On such analysis, if the requirements of s 10.3 are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence.</text>

<text>There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): 
 Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as "defences", for example, self defence is "exculpatory". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)). [Emphasis added] 

In an article published in Judicial Review entitled ' The Commonwealth Criminal Code : An Introduction to the General Principle s' the author Ian Leader-Elliot wrote:-
 
 Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not, of itself, establish guilt. Though all elements of an offence are established against a defendant, guilt may be defeated by reliance on a defence. Chapter 2 [of the Criminal Code ] adopts a binary structure in which "responsibility" is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence, combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence... There are, it should be said, significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences. [(2002) 5 Judicial Review 4 at 301] 

On such analysis, if the requirements of s 10.3 are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence.</text>

<tocase>Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341</tocase>
<text>The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with"' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK).

Generally, authorities show that in ascertaining the meaning of the word the most important consideration is the statutory framework within which the word operates. For example, in Centennial Coal , Barrett J defined contravention as conventionally meaning that which was mentioned above, but went on to say: 
 In the present context, however, "contravention" must be accepted as having a wider meaning. Section 1322(4)(a) is a remedial provision and the word "contravention" must, therefore, "be read in a very wide sense"... 
 Can one contravene an offence section if a defence is available?</text>

<tocase>Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237</tocase>
<text>The word 'contravention' may mean a breach of the law, but 'contravention' ' does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence unless the Act or law otherwise makes it so ': see Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237 at 242 referred to in Tran No. 1 at [28]. Conduct may be proscribed by Parliament, and the finding that such conduct has occurred may lead to the conclusion that a contravention of the law has occurred without an offence having been committed. However, facts may exist to satisfy a court that conduct constitutes not only a contravention, but simultaneously an offence. The text of the relevant statute must be considered in order to decide whether contravention means merely a breach of its provisions or commission of an offence.

The applicant invites the Court to find that because the word 'offences' is used in the heading of s 261A, the conclusion must be reached that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A should be limited only to a contravention of those sections of the Migration Act which create offences.

Pursuant to s 15AB(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act extrinsic material can be considered as an aid to interpretation where the text of the provision itself is ' ambiguous or obscure '. By s 13(3) the heading to a section does not form part of the statute. However, by s 15AB(2)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act the headings to sections comprise extrinsic material. Therefore, the pivotal consideration is whether the text of s 261A is ambiguous or obscure, so as to enable the Court to refer to the heading of s 261A when interpreting that section.

The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with"' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK).</text>

<tocase>Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265</tocase>
<text>Despite this conclusion, the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s 42 of the Migration Act , as was found in Tran No. 1 at [48]. In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265 Angel J said at 270: 
 They intended to so enter without a visa. Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act , not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s 42 relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act. The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act, nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act. They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned, that is, to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act. 

Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84 , however, that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes. His Honour's finding in relation to s 42 is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J. As has been stated, s 261A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur. All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act , and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Pursuant to the text of s 4A of the Migration Act the defences under the Criminal Code only apply to offences under the Migration Act , and thus cannot apply to a contravention of s 42 which is not framed as an offence.</text>

<tocase>Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1943/2.html</AustLII>
<text>Different considerations apply to the heading of Division 13A of Part 2 of the Migration Act which also contains the word 'offences.' Pursuant to s 13(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act a heading of a Division is part of the Act. In Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1 , Latham CJ said at 16: 
 The headings in a statute...can be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of a provision where that provision is ambiguous, and may sometimes be of service in determining the scope of a provision... "But where the enacting words are clear and unambiguous, the title, or headings, must give way, and the full effect must be given to the enactment" ( Bennett v. Minister for Public Works (N.S.W.) [1908] HCA 50 ; (1908) 7 C.L.R. 372 at 383). 

The Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the text of s 261A. The section speaks of the contravention of the Migration Act as a whole. Ambiguity might arise when that section is read with the heading to the Division, but as observed by Latham CJ, the headings may provide guidance only when the provision itself is ambiguous. Following from the finding that the provision is unambiguous the text of the heading must give way. It may be assumed that if Parliament had intended automatic forfeiture to occur only where 'offences' existed, it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have so provided, taking into consideration the choice of the word 'offences' in the heading of Division 13A of Part 2.

It follows that the operation of the automatic forfeiture provision in s 261A of the Migration Act is not limited only to contraventions of the offence provisions of that Act nor is it dependent upon a conviction for an offence. The Court reiterates its finding at [31] of Tran No 1 . Has there been a contravention of the Migration Act ?

As has been outlined in [18]-[20] of this judgment, ordinarily the Court cannot revisit a previous judgment that it has made. In Tran No. 1 at [31] the Court found that the Migration Act had been contravened by the applicant. However, a reading of that paragraph also records that the Court provided such answer within the context of a submission by the applicant that 'contravention' in s 261A should be made to be equated with 'offence' in order to enliven an automatic forfeiture. This Court, as stated at [33] of this judgment, finds that the word 'contravention' in s 261A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions, and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence.

The applicant has made a different submission at the subsequent hearing. The applicant now submits that, as a consequence of the acquittals or discontinuance of actions against the applicant, Mr Lai and Mr Nguyen, the automatic forfeiture never took place because the facts giving rise to automatic forfeiture under s 261A , namely contravention of the Migration Act , were never present. Such a submission does not depend on contravention being equated to an offence, nor to conviction of an offence.

As was stated at [30]-[31] of Tran No. 1 , following the decision of French J in Olbers , for the automatic forfeiture to arise the Court ' must be satisfied to a high degree of probability ' that contraventions of the Migration Act exist. In Tran No. 1 the Court stated that it was so satisfied but only in the narrow context of that which was submitted relating to the meaning of the word contravention. The new submissions justify the Court considering the new submissions separately to the decision already made even though a different interpretation of the same facts may result in a conclusion incompatible to the answers already given in Tran No. 1 .</text>

<tocase>Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/901.html</AustLII>
<text>On 16 June 2008 the Court delivered its findings in respect of specific questions which were asked of it pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth): see Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290 (' Tran No. 1 '). Since the facts and legislation are set out in that decision, the present decision should be read in conjunction with Tran No. 1 .

In Tran No. 1 the Court found that s 261A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act ') operated to effect an automatic forfeiture of the ship Hao Kiet BL91693TS ('the ship') on or about 1 July 2003 when the ship entered Australia carrying persons who held no valid Australian visas.

To answer the specific questions the Court was provided with an agreed statement of facts. The determination of such questions did not finally resolve the rights of the parties since an automatic forfeiture brought about by s 261A of the Migration Act remains contestable: see Tran No. 1 at [45]. The continuation of the hearing in respect of which this judgment is now delivered provided the applicant with the opportunity to provide any evidence upon which he relied to dispute that forfeiture of the ship had occurred. In Tran No. 1 the Court referred to the automatic forfeiture as ' the purported forfeiture ' (at [49]), only as a means of indicating that in these proceedings the applicant could challenge the forfeiture under the mechanism explained in that decision, that is, through the condemnation process.

On 9 September 2008 the applicant filed a Further Amended Application seeking a declaration that the ship is not forfeited, or, in the alternative, a declaration that any forfeiture ' including under s 261A of the Migration Act , is revoked ' and further declarations relating to the right of the applicant to possession of the ship. The Further Amended Application also seeks declarations relating to claims for damages arising from the alleged unauthorised destruction and/or loss of possession of the ship.

A Further Amended Statement of Claim was also filed on 9 September 2008. The Further Amended Statement of Claim raised the following claim (at [4]): 
 At all material times the Applicant was responding to a sudden and extraordinary emergency and believed that each of the Vietnamese citizens who so fled from Vietnam to Australia were entitled to receive protection from Australia by virtue of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugee ['the Refugee Convention '].

For these reasons the applicant submits that there is no relevant contravention of the Migration Act , and that in the absence thereof there has been no forfeiture and accordingly the Court should not confirm the automatic forfeiture. The applicant invites the Court to revisit its findings in Tran No. 1 in light of its further submissions.

The applicant claims that there has been a trespass to his property or intentional or negligent interference with his property and that just terms are payable under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in respect of the loss of the ship. The claim for damages is itemised in the amount of $307,274.85.</text>

<text>Before considering the substance of the applicant's claims, it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings. In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684 Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:- 
 ...the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution. Generally speaking, it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard. 

 
Similarly, Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of ' re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court ', nor ' because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put '.</text>

<tocase>Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1987/26.html</AustLII>
<text>In Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict.) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645 Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ discussed the origins of the modern law of self defence. They observed that such defence arose out of a context in which two kinds of defence to homicide, a defence of 'justification' and one of 'excuse', were available. The consequences of each defence were distinct, as their Honours considered at 657-658: 
 Justifiable homicide carried with it commendation rather than blame and accordingly entitled the accused to total acquittal, entailing no forfeiture and requiring no pardon... Excusable homicide, on the other hand, was not entirely without blame and merely excused rather than acquitted, requiring, at first, a pardon and involving, for a somewhat longer period, forfeiture. 

Such distinctions no longer exist, but this context led their honours to find (at 658) that self defence, ' as we now know it, was essentially exculpatory in origin '. The difference between the defences considered above demonstrates that, at the common law at least, one might be said to a have contravened the law even if a defence to a charge were available.

There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): 
 Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as "defences", for example, self defence is "exculpatory". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)). [Emphasis added] 

In an article published in Judicial Review entitled ' The Commonwealth Criminal Code : An Introduction to the General Principle s' the author Ian Leader-Elliot wrote:-
 
 Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not, of itself, establish guilt. Though all elements of an offence are established against a defendant, guilt may be defeated by reliance on a defence. Chapter 2 [of the Criminal Code ] adopts a binary structure in which "responsibility" is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence, combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence... There are, it should be said, significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences. [(2002) 5 Judicial Review 4 at 301] 

On such analysis, if the requirements of s 10.3 are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence.</text>
