<text>452 The notes then referred to discussion at the meeting about the implications and the possibility of the AR terminal being designated as rail corridor or commercial corridor land under s 215 of the Transport Infrastructure Act . The notes record the following:-
 
 "QT apparently consider they have the power to designate such a facility as of strategic importance to the State and effectively take control of it. This was clearly not the intent of this section of the Transport Infrastructure Act . QR would argue that the terminal was not of strategic importance to the State as part of a transport corridor. This is because it is non corridor. QR is also unaware of it being in a transport infrastructure strategy. If QT pursued this avenue they would also end up with ownership of a terminal and potential responsibility for reimbursing NRC for their $17m improvements. 
 
 If this avenue is not pursued by QT, Government (via Treasury) have the power to declare the terminal under the QCA Regulations. As such, QR is vulnerable to QT taking direct action contrary to QR's commercial interests."

453 The notes went on to record that it was decided the best way forward would be to maintain QR's stance that the terminal was non-corridor and:-
 
 
 " Resolutely refuse to have the terminal declared or made a common user facility and therefore no appeal processes if capacity not available to a third party using reciprocity and our need to have easy access to our own terminal as a rationale." (emphasis added)

454 The notes concluded by stating that QR may not need to brief the Minister if an agreement could not be reached because Queensland Transport was "giving precedence to their regulatory role over their shareholding role".

712 Even if Recital B(a)(ii) has the meaning suggested by Mr Graham's evidence, it would be wrong to construe the recital as over-riding the operative provisions of cl 5(6)(a): Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Limited v Commonwealth [1977] HCA 71 ; (1977) 139 CLR 54 at 73.

713 Mr Graham's evidence of his understanding of the EA, to the extent that it was inconsistent with the proper construction, was not reasonable and could not found an estoppel.

714 Clause 5(6)(a) makes it plain that it was for NRC to identify particular assets, as it did in relation to the AR terminal, and that the State of Queensland had a discretion as to the form of property rights to be granted. It could choose between ownership, lease or access. It was then for the parties to negotiate commercial terms and conditions for the grant of those rights. The grant of rights could not be complete until the negotiations were completed.</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114</tocase>
<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

765 At its highest, Mr O'Rourke's concession, and my view that Messrs Graham and Butcher held a similar assumption, establishes no more than a belief by all concerned that there would be negotiations. That claim runs headlong into the difficulty raised by the Privy Council in Humphreys and reiterated by Brennan J in Waltons . A hope or expectation that an agreement will be reached is not enough. The party asserting an estoppel must go further.

777 Priestley JA was there applying, although distinguishing on the facts, the principle stated by the Privy Council in Humphreys . His Honour's approach also reflects the principle stated by Brennan J in Waltons which I have set out at [766] above.</text>

(16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:-

 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

747 Failure to disabuse may, in some circumstances, create or encourage an expectation: Crabb at 188 189. But this head of equity usually depends upon proof that the owner of the property seeks to take unconscionable advantage of another by allowing the other to spend money on the property in the belief, known to the owner, that the person expending the money will enjoy a benefit over the property: Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead [1974] 232 EG 951 (" Holiday Inns ") discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at 607 608 and 610.

775 It may be that under the broader view of estoppel explained by Priestly JA in Austotel it is not necessary that the interest to be secured has been expressly indicated. I do not need to consider this question although I would observe that the Full Court in Mobil Oil was of the view that it is a necessary element of the principle that the person sought to be estopped has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "an interest" would be granted: see at 513.

776 What distinguishes the present case from the conclusion reached by Priestly JA in Austotel is that his Honour was of the view that the party sought to be estopped was certain to proceed with the lease and had so represented to the party asserting the estoppel: see at 613.</text>

<text>919 The categories of unconscionable conduct may not be closed but the authorities give some guidance as to the type of conduct which must be demonstrated so as to fall within the "unconscionable" label. What is required is "serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable".

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 200 ALR 491</tocase>
<text>914 Although there was some difference of opinion between the justices of the High Court in Berbatis as to the reach or breadth of s 51AA, it clearly involves taking improper advantage of a person at a disadvantage in circumstances where equity would intervene: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 200 ALR 491 (" 4WD Systems ") at [180] per Selway J.

918 The ambit of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA; it is not limited to equitable doctrines or common law principles of unconscionability: see Berbatis at first instance, [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 per French J at [24], and 4WD Systems at [183].

920 In order to establish that conduct is unconscionable under s 51AC, it is necessary to do more than show that the conduct contravenes s 52 of the Act or is otherwise in breach of the provisions of that legislation: 4WD Systems at [185].

931 Even if QR misrepresented the true position to Queensland Transport, as Selway J said in 4WD Systems at [185], this is not sufficient to constitute unconscionable conduct.

932 The other matters complained of go to what was said to be QR's attempt to subvert the effect of the EA or to the claim of abuse of market power.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/18.html</AustLII>
<text>774 The proposition that there might have been encouragement of the type mentioned by Mr George was not put to Mr O'Rourke. There is nothing in the document which gives rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference by reason of QR's failure to call Mr George. The present case is in no way analogous to the position in Bond Brewing (NSW) Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Waddell CJ in Eq, 17 August 1987), where the tenant of a hotel acted upon an assumption that the landlord would not terminate a lease without paying to the tenant a reasonable sum for the value of the goodwill. His Honour found that the landlord knew this to be so, and that detriment was clearly established. None of these elements are demonstrated in these proceedings: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 (" Berbatis ") at [57] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.

914 Although there was some difference of opinion between the justices of the High Court in Berbatis as to the reach or breadth of s 51AA, it clearly involves taking improper advantage of a person at a disadvantage in circumstances where equity would intervene: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 200 ALR 491 (" 4WD Systems ") at [180] per Selway J.

915 In my opinion the effect of what was said in Berbatis by Gleeson CJ at [7] [14], and by Gummow and Hayne JJ at [55] [58], is that two criteria must be established. The first is that the plaintiff was in a position of special disadvantage, whether by reason of illness, ignorance, inexperience, impaired facilities, financial need or other circumstances affecting its ability to conserve its own interests.

916 The second criterion is that the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's disability or special disadvantage.

918 The ambit of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA; it is not limited to equitable doctrines or common law principles of unconscionability: see Berbatis at first instance, [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 per French J at [24], and 4WD Systems at [183].</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Safeway Stores Pty Limited (2003) 129 FCR 329</tocase>
<text>1025 As Heerey and Sackville JJ pointed out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Safeway Stores Pty Limited (2003) 129 FCR 329 (" Safeway ") at [339], in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power it is necessary to look not only at what the firm did but why the firm did it. That is why a business rationale for the conduct, to which I referred in the second principle above, independent of the question of market power, is relevant to determining the sufficiency of the connection. That is what lies at the heart of the assessment of whether the firm has taken advantage.

1026 In the present case it is necessary to consider QR's rationale for refusing to grant a long term lease to NRC in 1997 and 1998 and for its service of the notice to quit on PN in May 2003.

1027 QR's business rationale for its conduct in 1997 and 1998 was not as fully developed as that which more clearly emerged in documents recording its objectives in giving the notice to quit. Nevertheless, documents exist which, when read in the light of oral testimony, explain why QR changed its position with respect to the grant of a long term lease to NRC in 1997 and why it maintained that stance in 1998. The documents were not admitted as proof of the facts but, insofar as they state QR's objectives, they must be accepted as containing such statements, unless challenged by PN.

1028 PN accepted that Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch were the witnesses whose evidence was relevant to QR's purposes in its 1997/1998 conduct.

1029 It is to be noted that at the outset, Mr O'Rourke stated in his letter of 27 March 1997 that the AR terminal was of strategic importance and that there was a need for it to be operated as a common user facility.

1112 In making a finding of purpose the Court is not so much concerned with the search for the "directing mind and will" of the corporation; it is concerned with inferences from the conduct of the corporation and of any other relevant person as well as other relevant circumstances: Safeway at [342] [343].

1113 An inference of proscribed purposes is to be drawn on the balance of probabilities, after giving due weight to the rule in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336: see Safeway at [341].</text>

<text>921 Morally unacceptable conduct in the form of unreasonable, unfair, bullying and thuggish behaviour amounts to unconscionable conduct within s 51AC: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead (Franchising) Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 (" No-Knead ") at [51] per Sundberg J. His Honour said that a refusal to supply or to negotiate constituted unconscionable conduct where the refusal amounted to intimidation or the application of illegitimate pressure on the other party to do something which the party applying the pressure had no entitlement to have done.

922 Neither of the elements of unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law has been proved. First, the proposition that NRC was in a position of special disadvantage needs only to be stated to be rejected. NRC was, and remains, a large corporation with a very substantial business. It was, and is, well and capably managed and it had the support of Commonwealth and State Governments. It had access to and relied upon legal advice from prominent and very competent firms of solicitors. Any suggestion that it was incapable of looking after its own interests must be firmly rejected.

923 Similarly, any suggestion that QR unconscientiously took advantage of a disability or special disadvantage of NRC in 1997 and 1998 or in giving the notice to quit to PN in May 2003 cannot be accepted.

930 There is nothing to suggest serious misconduct of the type described by the Full Court in Hurley . There is no suggestion of unreasonable or bullying behaviour or any attempt to apply illegitimate pressure of the kind referred to by Sundberg J in No-Knead . This is hardly surprising given the identity of the parties.

933 But unmeritorious negotiating positions could not, without more, amount to unconscionable conduct. At very least, it was necessary for PN to demonstrate that QR's behaviour was unreasonable in the sense stated in No-Knead and that the conduct was in fact carried out. Mr Scheuber disavowed any suggestion that unmeritorious behaviour took place. I accept his denial.

934 I have rejected the claim of abuse of market power in dealing with PN's claim under 
s 46 of the Act. The same matters relied upon to support a claim of unconscionable conduct must suffer the same fate.

935 PN contends that QR's conduct, firstly in its refusal to grant PN a long term lease of the AR terminal and, secondly, in issuing PN with the notice to quit on 26 May 2003, amounts to a taking advantage by QR of its market power in two rail infrastructure markets for the purpose of deterring or preventing PN from engaging in competitive conduct in two downstream linehaul markets.</text>

<tocase>Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks &amp; Spencer Plc [2001] All ER (D) 352 (Feb)</tocase>
<text>825 The position is effectively captured in the following passage from the judgment of Mance LJ in Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks &amp; Spencer Plc [2001] All ER (D) 352 (Feb) at [94]:-
 
 "As I have already said, the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long-term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long-term nature, and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct, when parties have not chosen, or have not been willing or able, to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves. These considerations, in my judgment, also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel, including relief limited to reliance loss, in the present context." 


 
As Mance LJ observed at [95] [96], even if the recognised principles of estoppel are "fertilised" by a broader approach exemplified in cases such as Holiday Inns , those cases are explained on the basis that the parties envisaged that rights already existed or they intended them to be created by contract.</text>

<tocase>Bond Brewing (NSW) Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Waddell CJ in Eq, 17 August 1987)</tocase>
<text>774 The proposition that there might have been encouragement of the type mentioned by Mr George was not put to Mr O'Rourke. There is nothing in the document which gives rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference by reason of QR's failure to call Mr George. The present case is in no way analogous to the position in Bond Brewing (NSW) Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Waddell CJ in Eq, 17 August 1987), where the tenant of a hotel acted upon an assumption that the landlord would not terminate a lease without paying to the tenant a reasonable sum for the value of the goodwill. His Honour found that the landlord knew this to be so, and that detriment was clearly established. None of these elements are demonstrated in these proceedings: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 (" Berbatis ") at [57] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</text>

<text>968 In Melway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 (" Melway ") at [43] the majority justices observed that the notion of market power as the capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors is reflected in s 46(3). The absence of constraint from customers is also a relevant matter. Matters of degree are involved: Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (" Boral ") at [121] per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J.

969 The circumstances which may give rise to the absence of competitive constraint on a corporation are diverse. They are not confined to the matters identified in s 46(3): see Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 164 (" Pioneer Concrete ") at 172-173 and 176; see also Boral at [168] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

979 Alternatively, any power arising from QR's ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC: Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172-173 and 176.

1020 Mr Ergas' opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power. However, that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above, in particular Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172 -173 and 176.

1022 Section 46 requires the co-existence of market power, taking advantage and proscribed purpose: Melway at [44] and Boral at [120].

1023 Whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is often a difficult question to answer. This may be because the words "take advantage" have been equated with "use": see Queensland Wire at 191, 194, 202 and 213 214; but the word "use" does not capture the full meaning of "take advantage": Boral at [279].

1024 The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction:-
 
(1) what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of: Melway at [44] and [67]; Boral [120] and [170]; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press ") at [51]. McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required: Boral at [279].
 
(2) if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation, that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct: Melway at [67]; Boral at [170].
 
(3) the words "take advantage" do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection: Rural Press at [51].
 
(4) in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage, is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market: Melway at [52] and [61]; Rural Press at [52].
 
(5) it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51]; Rural Press at [53].
 
(6) McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].
 
(7) the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].
 
(8) one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition: Queensland Wire at 202.
 
(9) the purpose of s 46 is the promotion of competition; it is concerned with the protection of competition, not competitors: Queensland Wire at 191 and 194; Boral at [87], [160], [164] and [260]; Melway at [17].
 
(10) it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power, which can be taken advantage of; to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process: Boral at [123], [194].

1078 As Heerey J said at first instance in Boral , this is a factor which points against a finding that the conduct constitutes taking advantage of market power: see (1999) 166 ALR 410 at 440. His Honour's views were adopted in the High Court: see [150] and [170].

1079 It seems to me that these were matters of commercial judgment which, when considered in the light of QR's continuing offer of access to PN and its proposed conversion of the AR terminal to a multi-user facility, suggest that this was not an exercise of market power or a taking advantage of it.

1080 Mr Ergas considered the question of how QR would behave in a competitive market by assuming that QR would provide PN with a 30 year lease because PN is a more efficient terminal operator than QR and, accordingly, it would be more profitable for QR if PN controls the terminal. He criticised QR's conduct as irrational in a competitive market and supported his argument by reference to various hypothetical examples.

1088 PN criticised Mrs Smith's approach as based on faulty assumptions, including an assumption that there are several terminals equivalent to the AR terminal for standard gauge. That criticism is well placed but I accept the general effect of her approach which is plainly consistent with objective facts. As McHugh J said in Boral at [260], a rational business firm seeks to maximise profit and to increase its share of the market. That is the obvious explanation of QR's conduct.

1090 As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, the operation of s 46 is predicated upon an assumption that competition is the means to protect the interests of consumers. Competition is by its nature deliberate and ruthless. All of the majority justices in Boral pointed out that s 46 is concerned with promoting competition, not protecting competitors: see [87], [160], [164] and [260]. Injuries to rivals are a necessary bi-product of vigorous competition.

1093 Second, I do not see that QR's desire to run the AR terminal as a common user or multi-user facility gave it an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].

1124 First, there are constant reminders in the authorities that competition is a ruthless process. As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, competitors always try to injure each other by taking away sales and these injuries are the inevitable result of the competition that s 46 is designed to promote. In Boral at [88], Gleeson CJ and Callinan J pointed to the danger of confusing aggressive intent with anti-competitive behaviour: see also per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [160] and per McHugh J at [279].

1158 I do not consider that this constitutes a sufficient connection to amount to taking advantage within the principle stated by the High Court in Melway and Boral .</text>

<tocase>Brambles Holdings Limited v Carey (1976) 15 SASR 270</tocase>
<text>58 In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Limited [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563 at 582-3, the High Court approved the following statement of principle of Bright J in Brambles Holdings Limited v Carey (1976) 15 SASR 270 (" Brambles ") at 279:-
 
 "Always, when beliefs or opinions or states of mind are attributed to a company it is necessary to specify some person or persons so closely and relevantly connected with the company that the state of mind of that person or those persons can be treated as being identified with the company so that their state of mind can be treated as being the state of mind of the company."

59 That is not to say that the state of mind to be attributed to a corporation must always be the state of mind of one particular officer: Brambles at 275 per Bray CJ; see also Wood v City of Melbourne (1979) 26 ALR 430 at 447.

60 However, difficulties arise in ascertaining the state of mind of large corporations: Brambles at 275. Different board members may hold different beliefs and it is sometimes possible to look beyond the resolutions of the board to the deliberations of individual board members as well as those of senior management: Ishac v David Securities Pty Limited (No 6) (1992) 7 ACSR 199 at 200-201 per Young J and the authorities there cited.

61 As Bray CJ said in Brambles at 276, a corporation cannot know or believe two contradictory things at once and it is rational belief, not schizophrenia which is to be attributed; see also Halsbury's Laws of Australia , Vol 7 Corporations at [120-3045].

62 Here, Mr Graham was "closely and relevantly connected" with all decisions taken by NRC in relation to the AR terminal during the period from about six months after the execution of the EA to 21 February 2002 when the shares were purchased by the Toll/Patrick consortium. He was directly responsible for all dealings with respect to the AR terminal during that period. He made the decisions as to what steps should be taken and his recommendations to the Board were accepted by the Board members. There was evidence, in general terms, from a number of Board members, Mr Butcher, Mr Moore-Wilton, Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh, that they relied on Mr Graham.

63 Whether NRC's state of mind for the purpose of determining what, if any, assumptions were adopted, is confined to that of Mr Graham is not entirely clear. PN accepted in final address that Mr Graham's state of mind was "paramount". But it submitted that Mr Butcher's assumptions were also relevant because of his regular discussions with Mr Graham. Although PN called evidence from Mr Moore-Wilton, Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh, it did not submit that their states of mind were to be attributed to NRC. That is hardly surprising because their assumptions were different from Mr Graham's. However, the same comment applies to Mr Butcher.

67 PN also called evidence from Mr Hanscomb, a senior executive of NRC, who had, in 1991, assisted Mr Moore-Wilton on the Committee of Officials (which was a Committee established to examine options for the funding of NRC) and assisted in drafting the EA. His expectation was that there would be a lease. I do not consider that his state of mind is to be attributed to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles . His evidence has some bearing on Mr Graham's expectations.

68 Mr O'Rourke was the CEO of QR and its predecessor, Queensland Railways. He was closely and relevantly connected with all dealings and decisions in respect of the AR terminal. His state of mind can be treated as that of QR for the purpose of determining what assumptions QR held and he must be taken to have known what was in his mind as CEO of Queensland Railways.

69 The relevant period for determining on what assumptions QR acted and the conduct which is said to have induced NRC to act to its detriment is the period up to March 1997 or perhaps to the date of Mr O'Rourke's letter of 25 March 1998. The other relevant mind of QR in that period was Mr Hearsch.

670 Second, as I have already mentioned, there are inconsistencies between the various assumptions said to have been held by Mr Graham, as managing director, and the board members who were called. It is true that Mr Graham was far more relevantly connected with the day to day dealings with QR in relation to the AR terminal than were Mr Butcher and the other board members. But it was the board which made the ultimate decisions to incur the expenditure on the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy, not Mr Graham: cf Brambles.

694 In any event, the inconsistent evidence of Mr Graham and the other directors indicates that no clear or unambiguous assumption was held by NRC. Even if Mr Graham's belief was the only state of mind attributable to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles , so that his state of mind was that of NRC, the estoppel claim fails for other reasons stated later.

695 Assuming I am correct in reaching the conclusion that PN has not proved that the relevant persons held the alleged assumptions, it is unnecessary to examine the extensive documentary record to see whether the documents give rise to an inference that NRC did in fact hold those assumptions. In any event, in my opinion, the documents do not support such a finding.

696 Plainly, the critical document is the EA. It laid down the legal framework agreed between the Commonwealth and the States for the establishment of NRC as a government owned corporation to conduct rail freight operations on a national integrated rail network.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/39.html</AustLII>
<text>21 Thus, whilst denying that NRC has made good the basal elements of its estoppel claim, the respondent points to the following proposition stated by McHugh J in Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (" Verwayen") at 501 as a complete answer to the claim:-
 
 "Once the detriment has ceased or been paid for, there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting on reverting to his or her former relationship with the other party and enforcing his or her strict legal rights."

22 NRC puts its claim under both s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") and estoppel but similar questions arise in each of the claims.

23 NRC also claims that the respondent has engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of ss 51AA and 51AC of the Act . These claims turn largely upon strategies put forward by the respondent's middle management, in particular during 2001, for avoiding any obligations on the State of Queensland under the EA and for the use of the AR terminal as a "bargaining chip" in efforts by the respondent to enter interstate markets for the supply of rail freight services.

662 In the Verwayen at 409, Mason CJ described estoppel as a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories. I do not need to set out all of the rules because PN confined its case to three categories. In doing so, PN recognised that the question of whether there is a "single overarching doctrine" or "a general doctrine of estoppel by conduct" was left open by the High Court in Giumelli v Giumelli [1999] HCA 10 ; (1999) 196 CLR 101 (" Giumelli ") at [7].

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

835 The third category, operational detriment, involves the fulfilment of expectations. It is an aspect of the broader category of detriment referred to in Verwayen.

836 Three principles should be added to those which I included in my summary of the relevant legal principles of estoppel at [668-(5) (9)]; see also propositions (5) and (6) in Brennan J's summary of the principles of equitable estoppel set out at [668 (14)].

839 Third, the principles of equitable estoppel are concerned with satisfaction of the minimum equity necessary to do justice. Equitable estoppel is intended to relieve against the detriment suffered and not to make good an expectation: see the Full Court's discussion of the principles stated in Verwayen in Mobil Oil at 516 517.

840 Fourth, once the detriment has ceased or been paid for, there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting upon the enforcement of its strict legal rights: Verwayen at 501.

841 This case is to be distinguished from all of the proprietary estoppel, or estoppel by acquiescence, cases because from the time when QR sought to resile from the alleged assumptions, it offered to negotiate to provide access rights in accordance with the EA.

842 In particular, from the time of the offer of the Terminal Services Agreement in Mr Wilson's seventh affidavit, there was a specific offer of terms which in my view cannot be said to be uncommercial. It seems to me that for PN to succeed in establishing the necessary detriment I would have to be satisfied that the terms offered by QR are so unreasonable that they could not possibly satisfy any rights which might be embedded in the broad terms of cl 5(6)(a) of the EA. In particular, I would have to be satisfied that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement does not confer upon PN the ability to recoup any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the offer of a long lease.

843 It must be borne in mind that QR has amended the terms of the proposed Terminal Services Agreement to meet some of the objections raised by PN in cross-examination of Mr Wilson. It is also to be borne in mind that QR has undertaken to keep the offer open until 90 days after the delivery of my judgment.

844 Although it is true that the term or period of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is not for so long as NRC continues to carry on interstate freight operations, I do not think that this is an answer to QR's contention that the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement will overcome any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the "offer" of a long term lease. Nor is PN's objection that the extensions of the term be at QR's discretion.

845 What seems to me to be the decisive answer to the estoppel claim put by PN is that under the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement, any detriment alleged by PN will cease for reasons set out below. That is to say the detriment, if any, will cease or be paid for within the principle stated by McHugh J in Verwayen .

846 Even if PN has not recouped the initial expenditure on the AR Terminal or on the East Coast Strategy, it will have ample opportunity to do so under the Terminal Services Agreement. It should be noted that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement incudes an offer by QR to expand the size of the terminal to add two parcels of land comprising an additional 3.25 hectares. This will enable QR to expand the capacity of the AR terminal so as to accommodate PN's existing profitable level of throughput with some increases as envisaged in the latest draft of the Terminal Services Agreement. It must be borne in mind that NRC has already had more than eight years to recoup any detriment said to have been occasioned by QR's change of position in March 1997.

847 PN called evidence from its Financial Controller, Mr Gilchrist. His evidence was that between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 2004, NRC had made a net benefit from its operation of the AR terminal of $104 million before tax and depreciation. He agreed that in calculating the net benefit it was appropriate to disregard depreciation.</text>

<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed.

(16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

761 A conventional estoppel must be mutual: see Con-Stan at 244. At most, there was a mutual assumption of Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke that control had been transferred for three years in anticipation of a lease of up to 30 years being negotiated. That is not an assumption of existing fact. If it can found an estoppel at all, it can only be a promissory estoppel: see [668-(13)], which I address below at [771].

762 The high water mark of this claim is Mr O'Rourke's concession that control was transferred to NRC on 5 April 1993 in anticipation of a 30 year lease being negotiated.

763 The climate of goodwill which then existed between the parties, and the perception amongst all concerned that micro-economic reform of the rail freight industry was to be effected, suggests that Mr Graham and Mr Butcher held a similar assumption.</text>

<tocase>Crabb v Arun District Council [1976] 1 Ch 179</tocase>
<text>665 The last mentioned words appear to be a reference to the form of estoppel stated in Ramsden v Dyson [1866] 1 LRHL 129 (" Ramsden v Dyson ") at 170. That is to say, it refers to an equitable estoppel arising from an expectation created or encouraged by the words or conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is raised. This form of estoppel includes failure to disabuse a party where the person estopped has knowledge of the other party's intention to act upon the expectation: see Crabb v Arun District Council [1976] 1 Ch 179 (" Crabb") per Lord Denning MR at 189.

747 Failure to disabuse may, in some circumstances, create or encourage an expectation: Crabb at 188 189. But this head of equity usually depends upon proof that the owner of the property seeks to take unconscionable advantage of another by allowing the other to spend money on the property in the belief, known to the owner, that the person expending the money will enjoy a benefit over the property: Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead [1974] 232 EG 951 (" Holiday Inns ") discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at 607 608 and 610.</text>

<tocase>Equuscorp Pty Limited v Glengallan Investments Pty Limited (2004) 218 CLR 472</tocase>
<text>757 Where the parties have entered into a written agreement, the Court will ordinarily hold them to the rights and obligations they have assumed under it. The law allows for exceptions but they must be proved according to established legal categories: Equuscorp Pty Limited v Glengallan Investments Pty Limited (2004) 218 CLR 472 at [35].

758 Mr Graham's evidence that there was no "sunset" provision on the transfer of control is at odds with the written agreements. Substantially greater and more precise evidence would have been required to establish any reasonable argument to the effect that the transfer of control was assumed to be for a longer period than the term of the lease.

759 Even if Mr Graham had an assumption that NRC would continue in possession and control of the AR terminal for a period beyond the expiration of the three year lease, that was not an assumption of existing fact.</text>

<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>674 This immediately exposes the difficulty of the different and contradictory assumptions entertained by those directors who gave evidence. There were other directors who did not testify. It must be inferred that their evidence would not have assisted: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (" Jones v Dunkel ").

675 What emerges is that Mr Graham's assumptions were quite different from those of the other directors and there were differences between the beliefs and assumptions of Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh.

676 Mr Graham and Mr Stanko (and perhaps Mrs Yeoh) were the only directors who were aware that one of the options available to the State of Queensland was the grant of access rights. But Mr Graham and Mr Stanko differed in their beliefs. Mr Graham accepted that the State's minimum obligation was to provide access rights, although he believed in effect that the rights would be perpetual, and on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.

774 The proposition that there might have been encouragement of the type mentioned by Mr George was not put to Mr O'Rourke. There is nothing in the document which gives rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference by reason of QR's failure to call Mr George. The present case is in no way analogous to the position in Bond Brewing (NSW) Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Waddell CJ in Eq, 17 August 1987), where the tenant of a hotel acted upon an assumption that the landlord would not terminate a lease without paying to the tenant a reasonable sum for the value of the goodwill. His Honour found that the landlord knew this to be so, and that detriment was clearly established. None of these elements are demonstrated in these proceedings: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 (" Berbatis ") at [57] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.

1190 It follows that I am not satisfied that the statements made in the relevant letters were incorrect. Moreover, I am not satisfied that the statements were made otherwise than honestly in good faith. It is true that Mr Smith was not called to give evidence, although a belated attempt was made to re-open to rely on his affidavit. But it is unnecessary for me to make a finding that his evidence would not have assisted; cf Sebben v Partridge (unreported Supreme of South Australia, Lander J, 20 December 1994). In that case, Lander J was of the view that a Jones v Dunkel inference was available where a defendant was not called, an unsuccessful attempt having been made to reopen after close of the defendant's case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/51.html</AustLII>
<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<text>662 In the Verwayen at 409, Mason CJ described estoppel as a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories. I do not need to set out all of the rules because PN confined its case to three categories. In doing so, PN recognised that the question of whether there is a "single overarching doctrine" or "a general doctrine of estoppel by conduct" was left open by the High Court in Giumelli v Giumelli [1999] HCA 10 ; (1999) 196 CLR 101 (" Giumelli ") at [7].

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J.

That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675.

It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244.

(2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J.

(5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

837 First, the party asserting an estoppel must prove it would suffer a detriment if the "estopped" party is permitted to resile from the assumption. This is an essential element of an estoppel claim whether in common law or equity: Grundt at 674.</text>

<tocase>Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead [1974] 232 EG 951</tocase>
<text>747 Failure to disabuse may, in some circumstances, create or encourage an expectation: Crabb at 188 189. But this head of equity usually depends upon proof that the owner of the property seeks to take unconscionable advantage of another by allowing the other to spend money on the property in the belief, known to the owner, that the person expending the money will enjoy a benefit over the property: Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead [1974] 232 EG 951 (" Holiday Inns ") discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at 607 608 and 610.

825 The position is effectively captured in the following passage from the judgment of Mance LJ in Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks &amp; Spencer Plc [2001] All ER (D) 352 (Feb) at [94]:-
 
 "As I have already said, the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long-term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long-term nature, and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct, when parties have not chosen, or have not been willing or able, to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves. These considerations, in my judgment, also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel, including relief limited to reliance loss, in the present context." 


 
As Mance LJ observed at [95] [96], even if the recognised principles of estoppel are "fertilised" by a broader approach exemplified in cases such as Holiday Inns , those cases are explained on the basis that the parties envisaged that rights already existed or they intended them to be created by contract.</text>

<text>741 The first assumption is that QR would grant a lease or access "for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations in Queensland" on a commercial basis, or for at least 30 years.

<text>719 The short answer to the status of documents such as the Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement is that they were superseded by the EA. In an estoppel case, it is possible to put forward an understanding based on communications which preceded the execution of a written agreement: cf Hoyts' Pty Limited v Spencer [1919] HCA 64 ; (1919) 27 CLR 133; see Waltons at 399 403.

<tocase>Hurley v McDonald's Australia Limited (2000) ATPR 41-741</tocase>
<text>919 The categories of unconscionable conduct may not be closed but the authorities give some guidance as to the type of conduct which must be demonstrated so as to fall within the "unconscionable" label. What is required is "serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable". The term "unconscionable" imports "a pejorative moral judgment": Hurley v McDonald's Australia Limited (2000) ATPR 41-741 (" Hurley ") at [22] per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Oceana Commercial Pty Limited [2003] FCA 1516 at [336] per Kiefel J.

930 There is nothing to suggest serious misconduct of the type described by the Full Court in Hurley . There is no suggestion of unreasonable or bullying behaviour or any attempt to apply illegitimate pressure of the kind referred to by Sundberg J in No-Knead . This is hardly surprising given the identity of the parties.</text>

<tocase>Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29</tocase>
<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J.

(17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1].

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/22.html</AustLII>
<text>58 In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Limited [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563 at 582-3, the High Court approved the following statement of principle of Bright J in Brambles Holdings Limited v Carey (1976) 15 SASR 270 (" Brambles ") at 279:-
 
 "Always, when beliefs or opinions or states of mind are attributed to a company it is necessary to specify some person or persons so closely and relevantly connected with the company that the state of mind of that person or those persons can be treated as being identified with the company so that their state of mind can be treated as being the state of mind of the company."

823 This approach to the question of whether negotiations between parties gave rise to a tenancy by estoppel was adopted by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Kellow-Falkiner Motors Pty Limited v Nimorakiotakis [2001] ANZ Conv R 230 at 233 234.

824 NRC, as a well resourced, commercially sophisticated rail operator, advised by competent and experienced solicitors, must have know that it could not reasonably rely upon rights under a lease, or rights of access or management or control of the terminal in the absence of a written agreement. That is precisely what the last sentence of clause 5(6)(a) contemplated.</text>

<tocase>Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1983/11.html</AustLII>
<text>664 PN relied on the words of Mason and Deane JJ in Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406 (" Legione ") at 430 to support the formulation of the third category. In the passage to which PN referred, their Honours said that estoppel in pais includes common law estoppel comprising conventional estoppel and estoppel by representation. They also said that it includes "the overlapping equitable doctrines of proprietary estoppel and estoppel by acquiescence or encouragement".

666 It follows from the description of estoppel in pais in Legione at 430 and from the three categories propounded by PN, that each of the categories put forward is a species of estoppel in pais.

667 Without endeavouring to discuss the many and varying observations that have been made in the cases, I will attempt to state the essential propositions which flow from the cases and which underlie the determination of the present proceedings.

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<text>732 Negotiations commenced with the delivery by Mrs Fontaine of a draft lease to Mr Jenner on 20 May 1996.

<tocase>Low v Bouverie [1891] 3 Ch 82</tocase>
<text>737 The principle may be traced to a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Low v Bouverie [1891] 3 Ch 82. Bowen LJ explained it as follows at 106:-
 
 "Now, an estoppel, that is to say, the language upon which the estoppel is founded, must be precise and unambiguous. That does not necessarily mean that the language must be such that it cannot possibly be open to different constructions, but that it must be such as will be reasonably understood in a particular sense by the person to whom it is addressed."

738 It seems to me to follow that, whatever species of estoppel falls for consideration, the assumption which is said to have been engendered must be clear and unambiguous.

739 I have drawn attention to the different assumptions held by Mr Graham and the other directors because, at very least, this must negate the requisite elements of clarity and certainty.</text>

<tocase>Melway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/13.html</AustLII>
<text>968 In Melway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 (" Melway ") at [43] the majority justices observed that the notion of market power as the capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors is reflected in s 46(3). The absence of constraint from customers is also a relevant matter. Matters of degree are involved: Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (" Boral ") at [121] per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J.

979 Alternatively, any power arising from QR's ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC: Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172-173 and 176.

1020 Mr Ergas' opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power. However, that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above, in particular Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172 -173 and 176.

1022 Section 46 requires the co-existence of market power, taking advantage and proscribed purpose: Melway at [44] and Boral at [120].

1024 The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction:-
 
(1) what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of: Melway at [44] and [67]; Boral [120] and [170]; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press ") at [51]. McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required: Boral at [279].
 
(2) if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation, that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct: Melway at [67]; Boral at [170].
 
(3) the words "take advantage" do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection: Rural Press at [51].
 
(4) in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage, is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market: Melway at [52] and [61]; Rural Press at [52].
 
(5) it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51]; Rural Press at [53].
 
(6) McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].
 
(7) the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].
 
(8) one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition: Queensland Wire at 202.
 
(9) the purpose of s 46 is the promotion of competition; it is concerned with the protection of competition, not competitors: Queensland Wire at 191 and 194; Boral at [87], [160], [164] and [260]; Melway at [17].
 
(10) it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power, which can be taken advantage of; to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process: Boral at [123], [194].

1092 Moreover, the suggestion that QR took advantage of market power is at odds with three further principles which emerge from the authorities. First, I do not see how it can be said that to obtain possession with a view to converting the AR terminal to a common user facility as was sought in 1997-98 or a multi-user facility in 2003, was facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51] and Rural Press at [53].

1094 Third, QR's conduct cannot be said to have been "necessarily" an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].

1095 I will deal briefly with Mr Ergas' contention that a number of the clauses of QR's open offer in the Draft Terminal Services Agreement, as amended on 6 July 2005, constituted a misuse of market power. Mr Ergas argued that only a firm with market power could make such an offer. He argued that in a competitive market, confronted by such an offer, the firm would go elsewhere.

1096 Mr Ergas' attack focussed upon three clauses of the draft document (as amended) which I have set out above. They are: first, the provision dealing with late trains contained in cl 6.7; second, the provision for PN to be able to increase the monthly throughput in the capacity of the AR terminal, in addition to the right to a 10% increase in the allocated monthly TEU provided for in cl 1(a)(ii) of Schedule 2. The provision for additional throughput is found in cl 7.5, which includes in cl 7.5(d) the notion of a deemed permanent increase with resulting increased costs for PN.

1111 Purpose involves the notion of an intention to achieve the result spoken of in one or other of ss 46(1)(a) , (b) or (c): Queensland Wire at 214 and Melway at [31]. In the present case, PN contended that QR's purpose was to damage NRC or to deter it from engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market: s 46(1)(a) and/or (c), or to prevent NRC or Toll from entering the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market or from engaging in competitive conduct in that market: s 46(1)(b) and/or (c).

1158 I do not consider that this constitutes a sufficient connection to amount to taking advantage within the principle stated by the High Court in Melway and Boral .</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193</tocase>
<text>861 There are a number of reasons for this. First, any suggestion that a sitting government would act, or be likely to act, in a particular way based upon expressions of a particular point of view must usually be rejected. Although his Honour was dealing with principles of administrative law, it seems to me that what Gummow J said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193 at 207 211 applies equally in the present context. A discretion conferred by statute is to be exercised on a proper understanding of what the statute requires and, ordinarily, is not to be confined by a statement or decision which forecloses the discretion.

862 It seems to me to follow from this that any suggestion of a lost opportunity to obtain the benefit of Mr Hamill's support cannot be an opportunity which the law would recognise.

863 Second, there is nothing to suggest that a long lease would have been negotiated in the available time. It took nearly three years for the parties to agree the final terms of the three year lease that was the subject of the 4 April 1993 Heads. The good faith negotiations for a new lease which commenced in May 1996 had not culminated in an agreement after about 10 months of negotiations.</text>

<text>698 The terms of the EA could, if supported by necessary evidence from the relevant minds on behalf of NRC, give rise to a "legitimate expectation" that the State of Queensland and QR would act conformably with the terms of the EA: see, in a different context, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273.

699 However, any evidence given by the directors of NRC as to their expectations based upon reading the EA would have to be tested against the proper and ordinary construction of the EA. This is because of the principle stated in [668-(16)] that the adoption of any assumption by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable.</text>

<tocase>Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475</tocase>
<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

775 It may be that under the broader view of estoppel explained by Priestly JA in Austotel it is not necessary that the interest to be secured has been expressly indicated. I do not need to consider this question although I would observe that the Full Court in Mobil Oil was of the view that it is a necessary element of the principle that the person sought to be estopped has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "an interest" would be granted: see at 513.

839 Third, the principles of equitable estoppel are concerned with satisfaction of the minimum equity necessary to do justice. Equitable estoppel is intended to relieve against the detriment suffered and not to make good an expectation: see the Full Court's discussion of the principles stated in Verwayen in Mobil Oil at 516 517.</text>

<text>37 It would be a false dichotomy to suggest that there is a distinction between taking advantage of market power and taking advantage of property rights: see NT Power Generation Pty Limited v Power and Water Authority [2004] HCA 48 ; (2004) 219 CLR 90 (" NT Power ") at [125]. Property rights can be a source of market power attracting liability under s 46 of the Act .

981 The position in the present case is quite different from that which existed in NT Power . There, the owner of electricity and distribution infrastructure which refused access to a competitor was held to have a substantial degree of power in the market for transmission and distribution of electricity. The owner was held to have taken advantage of its power for a proscribed purpose.

982 However, by contrast with the present case, the market power of the infrastructure owner in NT Power derived from its ownership and control of the infrastructure. The majority justices said at [63] that the critical fact underlying the owner's market power was its control of the infrastructure; see also at [114].

983 Mr Ergas sought to overcome this difficulty in PN's case by arguing that QR had market power by reason of its ability as owner to refuse to grant a lease and to thereby undermine PN's security of tenure. This, he said, could increase PN's costs by reducing its ability to invest in improvements to the AR terminal which would increase PN's costs on the East Coast Line, thereby giving exclusionary market power to QR.

984 Mr Ergas added to this that if PN does not have secure long term leasing arrangements the effect is to threaten investment security and impede it from operating efficiently, forcing it to have higher costs and, in turn, raising rival's costs.

1004 QR also submitted that it was not a supplier of the relevant service, namely access. It pointed to the statement in NT Power at [115] that s 46(4)(c) provides that the relevant power is supplier power or acquirer power. It submitted that QR was not a supplier of access, that service being supplied by PN through its existing control of the AR terminal.

1005 In NT Power at [115] the majority justices were merely identifying "the character or capacity in which the corporation has whatever market power it has". They distinguished this from other forms of power such as that of a financial institution.

1006 This leaves open the possibility that in certain circumstances an owner whose market power derives from its capacity as owner may have "supplier power" in the sense referred to by McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power . However, in the present case, it seems to me that without any right of possession, and in circumstances in which QR's own requests for access has been refused, it cannot be said that it has the requisite capacity.

1007 A further question arises on the pleadings. It is whether QR has market power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market by reason of its control of the track from the AR terminal to the NSW border. However, I accept QR's submission that this is a false issue because there is no complaint that QR has sought to injure NRC as a competitor by denying or restricting its access to the track.

1008 Accordingly, I do not need to consider QR's submission that there are various constraints on the power. Nevertheless, I would observe that there is considerable force in Mr Ergas' argument that a self imposed constraint is no constraint at all. This seems to me to answer QR's submission that the East Coast Line is administered by QR's NAG in the same way as the infrastructure on the North Coast Line which is the subject of a statutory undertaking. I doubt that the NAG is truly ringfenced as contended by QR.

1128 Third, in my view, QR's longstanding offer to grant access rights to NRC and its desire to establish a common user or multi-user facility at the AR terminal are inconsistent with the purposes for which NRC contends. This distinguishes the case from NT Power, where the infrastructure owner appreciated the existence of its market power and of the capacity to exercise that power to deliver access to the infrastructure: see NT Power at [150].

1129 Fourth, although they post date the impugned conduct, the General Freight Agreement of 10 November 2003 for access to the East Coast Line, and the North Coast Access Agreement of 1 October 2004 for access to the North Coast Line, are inconsistent with the suggestion of proscribed purposes.

1130 In cross-examination of Mr Merrigan it was suggested that certain observations in his report of March 2000 revealed a purpose of eliminating NRC as a competitor. He was taken to his remarks that NRC would not be a player in the long term and that this would be to QR's competitive advantage; see [422] [423]. Mr Merrigan said that this was a reference to NRC ceasing to exist as such after privatisation. There is force in Mr Walker's proposition that this was "meritless fencing". But I do not see that the comments of a consultant to QR, without more, are sufficient to give rise to an inference of proscribed purpose.</text>

578 As with Schedule 2 in the March draft, the maximum TEU may be increased by 10% if the Rail Operator provides written notice, however a critical difference is contained in the amendments to subsection (ii) of Schedule 2(a), which I shall set out:-
 
 "(ii) The aggregate Allocated Monthly TEU of 20,830 referred to in paragraph (i) above Schedule 4 as at the date of this agreement may be permanently increased by up to 10% in any particular month by the Rail Operator by giving the Terminal Manager written notice at least 2 months prior to seeking that increase. Once the Rail Operator has given such a notice, the increased figure will be deemed to be the figure for the aggregate Allocated m Monthly TEU in the relevant month for the purposes of paragraph (i) above, and will also be deemed to be the figure for the aggregate Allocated m Monthly TEU referred to in paragraph (b) (i) below. However, the Allocated Monthly TEU for each month may only be increased under this paragraph (ii) by a maximum of 10% above the TEU for that month listed in Schedule 4 as at the date of this agreement . Any other increase will be dealt with under clauses 7.5 and 7.6 of this agreement ."

579 Reference is also made in Schedule 2(a)(i) to cl 7.5 and 7.6, which have been added to the July draft. Clause 7.5 relates to additional monthly throughput, and provide as follows:-
 
 "7.5 Additional Monthly Throughput 
 
 (a) Upon written request by the Rail Operator given prior to 1 July each year during the Term (but not more than once in each calendar year), the Rail Operator may request the Terminal Manager provide Terminal Services for Additional Monthly Throughput for the remaining months of the Term commencing 1 January of the following year or such later date nominated by the Rail Operator. For the avoidance of doubt , a written request by the Rail Operator may not seek to reduce the Allocated Monthly TEU . The rights under this clause 7.5 are in addition to the rights to increase the Allocated Monthly TEU in paragraph 1(a)(ii) of Schedule 2. 
 (b) If, in the Terminal Manager's reasonable opinion when having regard to: 
 (i) the existing capacity of the Terminal; 
 (ii) the Terminal Manager's existing or likely future commitments to other users of the Terminal (including Queensland Rail and its Related Bodies Corporate); 
 (iii) the Additional Monthly Throughput requested by the Rail Operator; and 
 (iv) the extent to which the Terminal Services and the Terminal Manager's other operations in the Terminal can be carried out efficiently; 
 an Expansion is required in order to enable the Terminal Manage to provide Terminal Services for the Additional Monthly Throughput, clause 7.6 shall apply . 
 (c) If, in the Terminal Manager's reasonable opinion having regard to: 
 (i) the existing capacity of the Terminal; 
 (ii) the Terminal Manager's existing or likely future commitments to other users of the Terminal (including Queensland Rail and its Related Bodies Corporate); 
 (iii) the Additional Monthly Throughput requested by the Rail Operator; and 
 (iv) the extent to which the Terminal Services and the Terminal Manager's other operations in the Terminal can be carried out efficiently, 
 an Expansion is not required in order to enable the Terminal Manage to provide Terminal Services for the Additional Monthly Throughput requested, the Terminal Manager will agree to provide Terminal Services for the Additional Monthly Throughput . 
 (d) If the Terminal Manager does agree to provide Terminal Services for Additional Monthly Throughput pursuant to clause 7.5I the Allocated Monthly TEU for the remaining months of the Term will be deemed to be permanently increased by the relevant Additional Monthly Throughput for the purpose of this agreement, including paragraphs 1(a)(i) and 1(b)(i) of Schedule 2. However, paragraph 1(a)(ii) of Schedule 2 will no longer apply to any Allocated Monthly TEU that has been increased under clause 7.5(c)." (emphasis added)

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<tocase>Payne v Parker (1976) 1 NSWLR 191</tocase>
<text>1191 However here, Mr Lawrence was the source of the relevant information in the letters and in any event, QR disavowed any suggestion that the statements were made dishonestly. In these circumstances, I do not consider that Mr Smith's evidence would have elucidated this particular matter: see Payne v Parker (1976) 1 NSWLR 191 at 201 per Glass JA.

1192 I am not satisfied that NRC's consideration of QR's access applications involved anything other than a fair consideration of them on their merits, notwithstanding that NRC's responses were based on an erroneous assumption as to the overall capacity of the terminal. I do not consider that NRC was guilty of undue delay or obfuscation, as was suggested by QR.

1193 Accordingly, I have come to the view that NRC's failure to grant the access applications did not amount to taking advantage of market power. The relevant connection between NRC's market power and the impugned conduct was not, in my opinion, established.</text>

<tocase>Queensland Wire Industries Pty Limited v Broken Hill Pty Limited [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/6.html</AustLII>
<text>967 Market power may be defined as the ability of a firm to raise prices above supply costs without rivals taking away customers: see Queensland Wire Industries Pty Limited v Broken Hill Pty Limited [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 (" Queensland Wire" ) at 188 and 200. Market power is not confined to the ability to influence prices; it may be manifested in practices directed at excluding competition, such as exclusive dealing or refusal to supply: Queensland Wire at 200.

978 The reason for this is quite straightforward. QR owned the relevant infrastructure, but the terms of NRC's occupation, that is to say as a tenant with the right of exclusive possession and control, was inconsistent with the existence of market power residing in QR. The market is for the supply of access to the infrastructure. QR had no powers in that market. It had no ability to ask, let alone raise, prices for the supply of that service: Queensland Wire at 188 and 200.

1023 Whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is often a difficult question to answer. This may be because the words "take advantage" have been equated with "use": see Queensland Wire at 191, 194, 202 and 213 214; but the word "use" does not capture the full meaning of "take advantage": Boral at [279].

1024 The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction:-
 
(1) what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of: Melway at [44] and [67]; Boral [120] and [170]; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press ") at [51]. McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required: Boral at [279].
 
(2) if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation, that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct: Melway at [67]; Boral at [170].
 
(3) the words "take advantage" do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection: Rural Press at [51].
 
(4) in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage, is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market: Melway at [52] and [61]; Rural Press at [52].
 
(5) it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51]; Rural Press at [53].
 
(6) McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].
 
(7) the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].
 
(8) one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition: Queensland Wire at 202.
 
(9) the purpose of s 46 is the promotion of competition; it is concerned with the protection of competition, not competitors: Queensland Wire at 191 and 194; Boral at [87], [160], [164] and [260]; Melway at [17].
 
(10) it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power, which can be taken advantage of; to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process: Boral at [123], [194].

1089 There is a further reason why Mr Ergas' approach must be rejected. It is to be found in the reasons of the High Court in Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which explain the full impact of that decision.

1090 As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, the operation of s 46 is predicated upon an assumption that competition is the means to protect the interests of consumers. Competition is by its nature deliberate and ruthless. All of the majority justices in Boral pointed out that s 46 is concerned with promoting competition, not protecting competitors: see [87], [160], [164] and [260]. Injuries to rivals are a necessary bi-product of vigorous competition.

1091 PN's approach is fundamentally flawed because it has at its heart the protection of its own position as a competitor of QR, not the interests of competition. It seeks to advance its own private interests over that of the public interest in promoting competition. It fails to distinguish between monopolistic practices which are prohibited and vigorous competition which is not: Queensland Wire at 202 per Dawson J.

1111 Purpose involves the notion of an intention to achieve the result spoken of in one or other of ss 46(1)(a) , (b) or (c): Queensland Wire at 214 and Melway at [31]. In the present case, PN contended that QR's purpose was to damage NRC or to deter it from engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market: s 46(1)(a) and/or (c), or to prevent NRC or Toll from entering the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market or from engaging in competitive conduct in that market: s 46(1)(b) and/or (c).

1124 First, there are constant reminders in the authorities that competition is a ruthless process. As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, competitors always try to injure each other by taking away sales and these injuries are the inevitable result of the competition that s 46 is designed to promote. In Boral at [88], Gleeson CJ and Callinan J pointed to the danger of confusing aggressive intent with anti-competitive behaviour: see also per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [160] and per McHugh J at [279].</text>

<text>703 The fundamental right given by a lease is a right of exclusive possession: Radaich v Smith [1959] HCA 45 ; (1959) 101 CLR 209 at 222. The nature of access contemplated by cl 5(6)(a), in order to distinguish it from a lease, must be a right of non-exclusive possession. But what is plain from the clause is that the grant of access is to be on commercial terms and conditions agreed between the parties.

<tocase>Ramsden v Dyson [1866] 1 LRHL 129</tocase>
<text>665 The last mentioned words appear to be a reference to the form of estoppel stated in Ramsden v Dyson [1866] 1 LRHL 129 (" Ramsden v Dyson ") at 170. That is to say, it refers to an equitable estoppel arising from an expectation created or encouraged by the words or conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is raised. This form of estoppel includes failure to disabuse a party where the person estopped has knowledge of the other party's intention to act upon the expectation: see Crabb v Arun District Council [1976] 1 Ch 179 (" Crabb") per Lord Denning MR at 189.

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<tocase>Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/75.html</AustLII>
<text>1024 The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction:-
 
(1) what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of: Melway at [44] and [67]; Boral [120] and [170]; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press ") at [51]. McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required: Boral at [279].
 
(2) if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation, that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct: Melway at [67]; Boral at [170].
 
(3) the words "take advantage" do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection: Rural Press at [51].
 
(4) in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage, is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market: Melway at [52] and [61]; Rural Press at [52].
 
(5) it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51]; Rural Press at [53].
 
(6) McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].
 
(7) the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].
 
(8) one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition: Queensland Wire at 202.
 
(9) the purpose of s 46 is the promotion of competition; it is concerned with the protection of competition, not competitors: Queensland Wire at 191 and 194; Boral at [87], [160], [164] and [260]; Melway at [17].
 
(10) it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power, which can be taken advantage of; to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process: Boral at [123], [194].

1092 Moreover, the suggestion that QR took advantage of market power is at odds with three further principles which emerge from the authorities. First, I do not see how it can be said that to obtain possession with a view to converting the AR terminal to a common user facility as was sought in 1997-98 or a multi-user facility in 2003, was facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51] and Rural Press at [53].

1194 Nor am I satisfied that NRC's purpose in failing to grant the access applications was a proscribed purpose in contravention of s 46. Its purpose was the protection of the integrity of its national network. The position is not entirely analogous with that which arose in Rural Press . Nevertheless, in my view, so long as NRC gave proper consideration to the access applications, which in my opinion it did, its purpose cannot be said to be to have been to prevent QR from engaging in competitive conduct in the relevant market.

1195 It follows from my rejection of PN's estoppel claim and from my rejection of the claims of misleading conduct, unconscionability and breach of s 46, that QR is entitled to an order for possession. There is to be a stay of the order in accordance with the undertaking given by QR to the Court.

1196 It also follows that QR is entitled to an order for payment by NRC of additional rent pursuant to s 139 of the Property Law Act .</text>

<tocase>Sebben v Partridge (unreported Supreme of South Australia, Lander J, 20 December 1994)</tocase>
<text>1190 It follows that I am not satisfied that the statements made in the relevant letters were incorrect. Moreover, I am not satisfied that the statements were made otherwise than honestly in good faith. It is true that Mr Smith was not called to give evidence, although a belated attempt was made to re-open to rely on his affidavit. But it is unnecessary for me to make a finding that his evidence would not have assisted; cf Sebben v Partridge (unreported Supreme of South Australia, Lander J, 20 December 1994). In that case, Lander J was of the view that a Jones v Dunkel inference was available where a defendant was not called, an unsuccessful attempt having been made to reopen after close of the defendant's case.</text>

<tocase>Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Limited v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/51.html</AustLII>
<text>873 Three clauses call for consideration. Clause 3 deals with the term of the amended Terminal Services Agreement. The initial term is for approximately two and a half years, to 5 October 2008. Renewal for a period of five years is conditional upon the existence of a Corridor Access Agreement for the full renewal period. Since QR owns the rail track from the border to the AR terminal, it would be under an implied duty to cooperate with PN in the grant of a Corridor Access Agreement: Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Limited v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607.

874 It is true that, under cl 3.2, extensions beyond the Renewal Term are in the discretion of QR. But there is nothing to suggest that QR would refuse to extend the agreement to PN which would, at least on the existing evidence, be its largest customer. Moreover, a refusal may trigger a claim of contravention of s 46 of the Act, although, of course, that would depend upon the factual circumstances at the time of any refusal.</text>

<tocase>South Australia v Commonwealth [1962] HCA 10 ; (1962) 108 CLR 130</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1962/10.html</AustLII>
<text>700 QR submitted that the EA was a political agreement not intended to create legal relations: see eg South Australia v Commonwealth [1962] HCA 10 ; (1962) 108 CLR 130 ("Railways Standardisation Case") at 140, 148, 149, 150 and 153-154. There is considerable force in this submission. Mr Hanscomb acknowledged that the EA was a mixture of commercial arrangements and political imperatives. However, PN does not seek to enforce the EA. Rather, PN contends that the EA engendered assumptions founding an estoppel.

701 It is unnecessary for me to decide whether a political agreement is capable of providing the foundation for a claim in estoppel. I consider it unlikely to be so capable in the absence of a representation or other conduct which could have been relied upon. But even if the terms of the EA could give rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because PN's evidence of the assumptions said to arise from a reading of the EA rests upon two misconceptions.

702 First, "access" in cl 5(6)(a) is not to be given a meaning equivalent to "control" or "exclusive possession". To do so would be to construe "access" as conferring rights equivalent to a lease. That cannot be correct because cl 5(6)(a) specifically distinguishes between ownership, lease and access. It follows that "access" must import something different from the rights which would flow from a lease.</text>

<text>668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.</text>

<tocase>Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) 213 ALR 249</tocase>
<text>854 Quite apart from the fact that Mr Lonergan's third report adopted a completely different approach and methodology to his previous report, there are a number of serious difficulties with his evidence which cause me to reject it. First, Mr Lonergan did not identify which costs were fixed and which were variable. Second, PN failed to discharge the onus of adducing evidence of all the costs of operations on the East Coast corridor. I could not be satisfied that Mr Lonergan's evidence matched the whole of PN's expenditure with the whole of its revenue. This criticism is directed at PN rather than Mr Lonergan. PN carried the evidentiary onus on this issue: Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) 213 ALR 249 at [17], [151] [155].

855 The evidence of QR's witness, Mr Bryant, is to be preferred, notwithstanding that both experts are well qualified.

856 The short answer to Mr Lonergan's attempt to offer a different approach to interest costs is that his first report was based on actual interest costs whereas his third report looked at interest in the nature of opportunity costs. A calculation of whether expenditure has been recouped is not concerned with lost opportunity costs. Accordingly, Mr Lonergan's approach to this issue in his third report was irrelevant to the issue at hand.</text>

(2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

672 Here the question is whether there has been an unjust departure by one person, that is to say QR, "from an assumption adopted by another [ie NRC]" as the basis for NRC's decision to make the investment decisions to which I have referred: see Thompson at 547.

673 Thus, although as I have said at [62], Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on Mr Graham, it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by Mr Graham. I do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter.

693 It follows that of the four pleaded assumptions, only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence. But the only evidence to support it was that of Mr Graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors. In my opinion this does not establish that NRC adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by Dixon J in Thompson .

744 As Dixon J said in Thompson at 547, whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption.

745 Even if the assumptions propounded by PN are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because QR did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption.

746 Mr Graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the EA. He did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by Mr O'Rourke or, to the extent that Mr Hamill's conduct is, or may, be relevant, any positive statement or conduct of Mr Hamill. Instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from 1992 to March 1997 was inconsistent with Mr Graham's understanding of the EA.

865 The claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is, to borrow from the words of Starke J in Thompson at 528, at best "wholly speculative and conjectural" and affords "no solid basis" for concluding that NRC acted to its detriment.

866 The same may be said of the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl 7 of the EA. Not only did NRC fail to invoke the clause, but as I have already said, the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to NRC.

867 There were three species of operational detriment identified by PN. The first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the AR terminal given, in particular, by Mr Fullerton. The second was said to be the comparison between PN's existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by QR under the Terminal Services Agreement. This proposition was put to QR's CEO, Mr Scheuber, in cross-examination.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 164 Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty Limited (1992) 35 FCR 43 Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Limited v Ferrcom Pty Limited (1991) 22 NSWLR 389</tocase>
<text>969 The circumstances which may give rise to the absence of competitive constraint on a corporation are diverse. They are not confined to the matters identified in s 46(3): see Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 164 (" Pioneer Concrete ") at 172-173 and 176; see also Boral at [168] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

970 The primary consideration in determining market power is whether there are barriers to entry into the relevant market: Pioneer Concrete at 173, citing Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty Limited (1992) 35 FCR 43 (" Eastern Express ") at 62-63 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ.

971 A corporation will have a substantial degree of power in the market if it has a considerable or large degree of power: Eastern Express at 63.

972 In JD Heydon, Trade Practices Law : Restrictive Trade Practices, Deceptive Conduct and Consumer Protection, LBC, Vol 1, Sydney at [5.40], the learned author observes that s 46(1) is not concerned with a firm moving toward possession of a substantial degree of power in a market but only with a firm which has already gained possession of a substantial degree of power. This is because abuse of monopoly power consists of a corporation with the requisite degree of power taking advantage of it for a proscribed purpose. Unless the power presently exists there is nothing of which it can be said the corporation has taken advantage.

979 Alternatively, any power arising from QR's ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC: Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172-173 and 176.

1020 Mr Ergas' opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power. However, that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above, in particular Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172 -173 and 176.</text>

<tocase>Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/15.html</AustLII>
<text>875 PN will lose some flexibility in its ability to handle late trains. The wording of cl 6.7(a)(i) of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is awkward, but in my opinion it imposes a positive obligation upon the Terminal Manager to do what is reasonable in the circumstances to provide services: Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83 (" Transfield ") at 101. In my view, the alteration to the clause in the draft of 6 July 2005 to replace "reasonable endeavours" with "best endeavours" does not affect the scope or content of the obligation prescribed by the clause.

876 Clause 7.5 and Schedule 2 of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement make provision for the allocation of capacity to PN for increases in the allocated monthly TEU. Schedule 4 lists the allocated monthly TEU which varies according to seasonal use. The total annual allocation is approximately 235,000 TEU, which is equal to PN's throughput for the year ended 30 June 2004, as stated in Mr Lawrence's evidence. However, Mr Lawrence said that he expected throughput of 270,000 to 280,000 TEU for the year ending 30 June 2005.

877 Schedule 2 provides for an automatic and permanent increase of 10% in the allocated monthly TEU upon notice to the Rail Operator. This would enable PN to come close to the anticipated 2005 throughput.

1105 The proper construction of cl 6.7 seems to me to impose an obligation on QR to use reasonable endeavours to provide services for late trains: see Transfield at 101. The proper construction of the clause is not controlled by the heading. The clause is not clearly expressed but the agreement to use "best endeavours" must be seen as a proviso to the opening words of cl 6.7(a)(i) which appear on their face to deny such an obligation.

1106 The business rationale for the clause is the efficient operation of the AR terminal, whilst at the same time making provision for QR to use reasonable endeavours to service PN's late trains.

1107 In summary, it is my opinion that even if QR had a substantial degree of power in the market at the time of the impugned conduct, it did not take advantage of the power.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/49.html</AustLII>
<text>741 The first assumption is that QR would grant a lease or access "for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations in Queensland" on a commercial basis, or for at least 30 years. The extent of any such business and the degree of repetition or continuity of the requisite activity are not spelled out: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 8 and United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 15. Although the period of the lease or access was said to be for 30 years, the terms were to be on a commercial basis. That expression cannot have the requisite degree of certainty absent the agreement of the parties as to the content of the terms.</text>

<tocase>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher [1988] HCA 7 ; (1988) 164 CLR 387</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/7.html</AustLII>
<text>1 In Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher [1988] HCA 7 ; (1988) 164 CLR 387 (" Waltons") at 423, Brennan J pointed to the difficulty of contending for an estoppel against a party's freedom to withdraw from contractual negotiations. His Honour said that it is only if the first party induces the other to believe that the inducer, ie the first party, is already bound and that there is no freedom to withdraw, that it could be unconscionable for the first party to assert an entitlement to withdraw from the negotiations.

2 Notwithstanding this difficulty, the applicant contends that the respondent is estopped from interfering with its occupation, management and control of a parcel of land comprising about 202,000 square metres and known as the Acacia Ridge Interstate Container Terminal ("the AR terminal") near Brisbane in circumstances in which the respondent withdrew from negotiations for a 30 year lease. The respondent owns an adjoining parcel of land comprising about 86,000 square metres. This is known as the Q-link Terminal. I will describe its location at [194]. The respondent conducts rail freight services from the Q-link terminal. The applicant makes no claim to that terminal. These proceedings are concerned solely with the applicant's claim in respect of the AR terminal.

3 The respondent owns the AR terminal, which is an intermodal terminal enabling the transfer of containers between trains and trucks which service the Brisbane area. The applicant went into possession, and assumed the management and operational control, of the AR terminal on 5 April 1993. It has remained in occupation, management and control ever since. It occupied the AR terminal as a monthly tenant under an expired lease from April 1996 until its tenancy was purportedly terminated in May 2003. It remained in occupation thereafter as explained below.

668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise." 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys "). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation." 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA.

719 The short answer to the status of documents such as the Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement is that they were superseded by the EA. In an estoppel case, it is possible to put forward an understanding based on communications which preceded the execution of a written agreement: cf Hoyts' Pty Limited v Spencer [1919] HCA 64 ; (1919) 27 CLR 133; see Waltons at 399 403. But it seems to me that here any understandings or assumptions based on pre-contractual reports or heads could not be reasonable.

765 At its highest, Mr O'Rourke's concession, and my view that Messrs Graham and Butcher held a similar assumption, establishes no more than a belief by all concerned that there would be negotiations. That claim runs headlong into the difficulty raised by the Privy Council in Humphreys and reiterated by Brennan J in Waltons . A hope or expectation that an agreement will be reached is not enough. The party asserting an estoppel must go further.

766 The principles are summed up in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 423:-
 
 "Parties who are negotiating a contract may proceed in the expectation that the terms will be agreed and a contract made but, so long as both parties recognize that either party is at liberty to withdraw from the negotiations at any time before the contract is made, it cannot be unconscionable for one party to do so. Of course, the freedom to withdraw may be fettered or extinguished by agreement but, in the absence of agreement, either party ordinarily retains his freedom to withdraw. It is only if a party induces the other party to believe that he, the former party, is already bound and his freedom to withdraw has gone that it could be unconscionable for him subsequently to assert that he is legally free to withdraw."

767 As I understand PN's claim under this head, it is that QR was under a duty to inform NRC that it did not intend to proceed with the negotiations. The argument is built upon QR's knowledge that NRC was spending large sums on, or in relation to, the AR terminal.

768 However, I cannot see that this claim has any foundation. PN fairly and properly conceded that the negotiations for a new lease in 1996 were conducted in good faith by QR. The position might have been different if QR had not negotiated in good faith because an argument would then have been available that QR had resiled from an assumption which might, at least on one view, have been created by it. But that is not the case here. The assumption was that QR would negotiate in good faith for a 30 year lease. That was what took place, albeit the parties were still at odds on a number of fundamental issues when QR had a change of heart.

777 Priestley JA was there applying, although distinguishing on the facts, the principle stated by the Privy Council in Humphreys . His Honour's approach also reflects the principle stated by Brennan J in Waltons which I have set out at [766] above.</text>

<text>703 The fundamental right given by a lease is a right of exclusive possession: Radaich v Smith [1959] HCA 45 ; (1959) 101 CLR 209 at 222. The nature of access contemplated by cl 5(6)(a), in order to distinguish it from a lease, must be a right of non-exclusive possession. But what is plain from the clause is that the grant of access is to be on commercial terms and conditions agreed between the parties. The extent of the rights of access would be a matter of construction of those terms, as agreed: Winter Garden Theatre (London) Limited v Millennium Productions Limited [1948] AC 173.</text>
