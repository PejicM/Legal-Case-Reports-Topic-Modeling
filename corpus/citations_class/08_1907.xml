<text>7 Counsel for the respondents also pointed to some evidence to the effect that related proceedings are being funded by two gentlemen, Mr Brooks and Mr James as material that suggests that the proceedings have been brought for an ulterior purpose. She submitted that, for this additional reason, indemnity costs based upon the principle in Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397 should be ordered and should be ordered in respect of the whole proceedings.

8 It seems to me that more evidence would be required if I were to accept that these proceedings had been brought for an ulterior or extraneous purpose. I am not prepared to order indemnity costs on this basis. However, in my view, the proceedings could have, and should have, been resolved before today along the lines of the solution which was ultimately imposed by me earlier today. That solution had, in substance, been offered by the respondents on 4 December 2008. Indeed, much of what was offered on 4 December 2008 had been previously offered.

9 In those circumstances, I am of the view that the respondents are entitled to indemnity costs as and from 5 December 2008.</text>
