<tocase>Austal Ships Pty Ltd v Stena Rederi Aktiebolag (2004) 66 IPR 420</tocase>
<text>39 As noted by Bennett J in Austal Ships Pty Ltd v Stena Rederi Aktiebolag (2004) 66 IPR 420 at 433, the requirements in the patent specification in relation to 'narrow waisted' are:
 
 
 &#8226; 'SWATHs are catamaran type vessels where those parts of the hull located beneath the surface of the water are joined by narrow connections. Such vessels have a narrow hull waist, or narrow cross section, at the water line. 
 &#8226; The cross sectional shape of the hull shapes of the claims throughout a substantial portion of the forward half of the hull has a bulbous underwater part and a narrow waisted part which extends through the water line. 
 &#8226; The hull construction of the claims comprises a forward hull part which has a bulbous underwater cross section. That is, the hull width is narrower in the region of the water line than both above and below the water line. There are numerous references to the bulbous shape. For example, 'pronounced bulbous shape solely at the foreward part of its underwater body'. The bulbous shape of the forward part of the hull cross-section a relatively narrow hull width in the vertical region of the hull extends up through the water line. 
 &#8226; The figures, in particular fig 1, show the bulbous shape underwater and significant waisting at the water line. 
 &#8226; The hull is described in such a way as to indicate to the skilled reader that the forward part is SWATH-like. There is a specific reference to the link between the area above the water line and a characteristic of SWATHs'

40 Austal says that the expression 'narrow waisted', which is interrelated with the other requirements of integer 1.6, is also obscure and capable of diverse meanings.

41 It is noteworthy that the reference is to a waist which is narrow. Not all waisting can of course be described as 'narrow'. It is common ground that the degree of waisting of the preferred embodiment in Figure 1 (expressed as a percentage of the forward half of the hull which is narrowed or waisted) is as follows: 
 
 
 &#8226; 85% narrowing at 40% of the forward half of the hull;
 &#8226; about 79-80% narrowing at 50% of the forward half of the hull;
 &#8226; 62% narrowing at 80% of the forward half of the hull;
 &#8226; about 42% narrowing at 100% of the forward half of the hull; and
 &#8226; 23% narrowing at 120% of the forward half of the hull.

42 On an ordinary grammatical reading, waisting can occur when lines are merely not parallel. As a matter of language, the expression 'waisting' requires only a discernable narrowing. However, given that the expression at issue here is 'narrow waisting', I agree with Bennett J that the expression 'narrow waisting', on its correct construction, means a 'significant narrowing': see Austal Ships Pty Ltd v Stena Rederi Aktiebolag (2004) 66 IPR 420 at 433-434.

43 Mr Soars agreed that a hull with an underwater bulb which, at the waterline at 50 percent of the forward half of the hull, is waisted at little more than 20 percent would be profoundly different to the preferred embodiment in its ability to dampen the pitching of the vessel. Such a hull would have only one quarter of the waisting of the preferred embodiment at 50 percent of the forward half of the hull (that is, 20 percent waisting compared with 80 percent). Although Mr Soars ultimately put the requirement as being any waisting in excess of 20 percent, Austal notes that in cross examination Mr Soars referred to the expression 'narrow waisted' as being a vague one. By contrast, Mr Quigley considered that a vessel could not be a SWATH style vessel unless it had a waisting of at least 70 percent. He added that he had never seen a SWATH with only 20 percent waisting, stating that although he was unable to determine from the claims of the specification a precise percentage for the narrow waisting, a significant narrowing of the waist would require at least a 50 percent narrowing of the maximum underwater hull width. Accordingly, Austal submits that that degree of waisting, on the language of the claim, must be more than 50 percent.

44 The difficulty with the evidence of Mr Quigley is that he has regard solely to the SWATH-type characteristics of the vessel. He has given insufficient weight to the hybrid nature of the hull design issue in suit. In my view, a narrowing of the waisting in the order of 20 percent or more could be said to be a significant narrowing. I accept the evidence of Mr Soars on this point.

91 Other witnesses called for Austal were also unsatisfactory on this question. Mr Wagner's evidence neither relates to the issues in dispute in these proceedings, nor is based on any work done in Australia relevant in this case. Moreover, the designs with which he is familiar differ from the hull in the claimed invention. Mr Black's evidence suffers because he is not an independent witness, employed as he is by Austal, and because he was aware of the patent and had been involved in its opposition. Indeed, it is revealing to note that Mr Black described the similarities between the Austal 94 hull form and the patent claims as 'too close for comfort!'. His evidence that the expression 'narrow waisted' refers to any waisting whatsoever has already been rejected by Bennett J, with whom I agree at [42] above: see A ustal Ships Pty Ltd v Stena Rederi Aktiebolag (2004) 66 IPR 420 at 433-434. In addition, he refers to the concept of 'semi-SWATH', which indicates that his knowledge was affected by information obtained after the priority date.

92 The evidence of Mr Norman for Austal was also unsatisfactory. His evidence does not address the developments in Australia at Austal between the design of both Austal 14 and Austal 18 in 1990 and the design of Austal 94. It is significant to note that no evidence was adduced by Austal to explain the steps which were taken to arrive at the design of the Austal 94, despite the apparent availability of this information.

93 Austal relied on the "Patria", which was a modified SWATH in operation before the priority date, as an example of a vessel with SWATH-type features which could be suitably modified to solve the problem addressed by the patent. The "Patria", however, is classified as a SWATH vessel and the evidence indicates that its design and use of propeller propulsion created problems at speed. This indicates that any attempt to modify the "Patria" design would require significant design modifications in order to accommodate some form of water-jet propulsion in order to achieve speeds above 30 knots. While the "Patria" may have had good seakeeping features, this was achieved at the expense of speed, which is a critical element in the problem the invention was designed to meet. It should be noted that when Mr Quigley initially dealt with the question of obviousness, he made no reference whatsoever to the "Patria". This lends support to the conclusion that it was not a type of vessel which readily came to mind when considering the question of obviousness.</text>

<tocase>E I Du Pont De Nemours v ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 462</tocase>
<text>97 As pointed out by Emmett J in E I Du Pont De Nemours v ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 462 at 493:
 
 'Ultimately, it is a matter for the court as to whether a proposed line of enquiry was obvious to the relevant persons. Where the evidence of a relevant person constitutes no more than speculation as to what that person might have done in circumstances that had never arisen ... the evidence will have little weight'.

98 In my view, the evidence does not establish that the Davidson A hull would provide any basis to support the argument which would make the claimed inventive step obvious or non-existent.

99 Furthermore, simply because the earlier Austal hulls and Crowther hull included a bulbous bow in a catamaran hull design does not automatically mean they were relevant to a consideration of the problem addressed by the patent. It is left unclear as to the nature and extent of the modifications required to make such vessels suitable for use in exposed waters. I accept the evidence that these vessels did not disclose the use of a small water plane area for a substantial portion of the forward half of the vessel, which is a crucial feature of the patent specification. They were more akin to the water plane areas used in conventional catamarans at that time. The use of such vessels in calm or sheltered waters does not necessarily provide any useful guide to the design of a hull suitable for use at high speed in exposed waters, in which conditions the problem of good seakeeping is greatly increased.</text>

<tocase>Electric and Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen (1938) 56 RPC 23</tocase>
<text>20 Where the language of the specification is unambiguous, a court should not readily depart from the wording of the claim by reading words into it or using stray phrases in the body of the specification in order to narrow or widen the boundaries of the monopoly fixed by the plain words of a claim. As Lord Russell of Killowen stated in Electric and Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen (1938) 56 RPC 23 at 39:
 
 'The function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed, so that others may know the exact boundary of the area within which they will be trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not claimed is disclaimed. The claims must undoubtedly be read as part of the entire document and not as a separate document; but the forbidden field must be found in the language of the claims and not elsewhere.'

<text>72 The principles relating to 'inventive step' and 'obviousness' were recently considered by the High Court in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21. In that case, their Honours referred to ss 7(2) and (3) the Act , which describe the statutory test as to what constitutes an 'inventive step'. Their Honours noted at [122] and [150] that the standard by which obviousness is to be determined is by reference to the understanding of a person skilled in the relevant art, who, at the priority relevant date, would possess common general knowledge in that art, and who would have had regard to any additional information referred to in s 7(3): see also Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 188 ALR 280 at 287-289; Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at 414 (per Burchett J). The Court clarified at [152] that s 7(3) has the effect of enlarging the prior art base to include relevant prior disclosures beyond that information which is shown to constitute common general knowledge in that art.</text>

<tocase>Flexible Steel Lacing Company v Beltrico Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331</tocase>
<text>25 The gravamen of the submission by Austal is that the language of claim 1 is so obscure, ambiguous and uncertain in important respects that it cannot give rise to an infringement. The submission relies on the principle adopted by Hely J in Flexible Steel Lacing Company v Beltrico Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 at 348-349, that a claim may be bad for uncertainty notwithstanding that the Court could find its true meaning in the circumstances, if it is so obscure that its proper construction must remain a matter of doubt. The difficulty in the application of the principle is in defining the level of clarity required in the context of a particular claim. It is not sufficient to show merely that a claim might have been better drafted or that it is capable of more than one construction.

26 The imprecise language which Austal says makes claim 1 invalid for uncertainty resides particularly in the drafter's use of the undefined expressions 'substantial portion' and 'narrow waisted' in integer 1.6. The vagueness which arises from these expressions is said to be compounded because they are interrelated features relating to the bulbous underwater part of the hull shape. Austal notes that the expression 'substantial portion' was first introduced into the claim by an amendment as a consequence of opposition.

27 Mr Soars who gave evidence for the applicant is a qualified naval architect. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in engineering and is a member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. He has had considerable experience in the design of large twin hull vessels. His expertise and experience is not in issue. Between 1980 and the year 2000 he was involved in the design of over 120 high speed light craft ranging from 16 metres to 100 metres. He was the Senior Naval Architect at Incat Designs between 1983 and 1985, a role which involved computer programming, structural design, design technology developments, supervision and project management for high speed catamarans.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/8.html</AustLII>
<text>19 There is no significant dispute as to the relevant legal principles of interpretation. It is clear that the claims must not be read in the abstract, but rather in their context, including existing published knowledge. What is being construed is a public instrument which must define a monopoly in such a way that it is not reasonably capable of being misunderstood: Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 476. In Kimberly-Clark Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at 16, the majority joint judgment noted that it is necessary to construe the complete specification in the light of the common general knowledge and the art before the priority date, allowing the Court to place itself in the position of a person reading the specification who is acquainted with the surrounding circumstances as to the state of that art and its manufacture at that time.

20 Where the language of the specification is unambiguous, a court should not readily depart from the wording of the claim by reading words into it or using stray phrases in the body of the specification in order to narrow or widen the boundaries of the monopoly fixed by the plain words of a claim. As Lord Russell of Killowen stated in Electric and Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen (1938) 56 RPC 23 at 39:

<text>22 In Leonardis v Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd (1996) 67 FCR 126 at 134, the Full Court stated that it is not inadmissible to use an imprecise word in a claim where, in an appropriate context, it conveys the necessary meaning. The Court there referred to the use in patent claims of imprecise expressions such as 'relatively small', 'a minor amount', 'substantial effect' and 'substantially above' as terminology which does not necessarily invalidate a patent. Relative expressions which require the exercise of judgment can be used but they must be understood in a practical commonsense manner. Moreover, as Dixon CJ cautioned in Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 at 60, a patentee does not have to express his claim with a precision that implies an arbitrary restriction on the inherent variability of a feature which is part of the invention.</text>

<text>66 The priority date of the claims is to be determined according to ss 43 and 114 (1) of the Act and regs 3.12 and 3.14 of the Patents Regulations 1991 (Cth) ("Regulations"). The effect of these provisions is that the priority date of the current patent is the filing date in Australia, namely 28 January 1992, unless the Regulations so provide. However, if the claims of the patent are fairly based on matter which is disclosed in the original application document in Sweden, then the priority date will be the date of filing in Sweden, namely 30 January 1991. In other words, if the present claims cover matters which were in substance really and reasonably clearly disclosed, so that the invention as now claimed is broadly described in the body of the original specification considered as a whole, then the priority date will be taken as 30 January 1991: see Pfizer Inc v Commissioner for Patents [2005] FCA 137 ; (2005) 141 FCR 413 at 420; Rhem Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95; Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at 300-301.

105 As to the question of fair basis, because I consider the patent as granted is fairly based on the disclosure in the original application in Sweden, and taking into account the similarity of that patent specification and the present patent specification, I consider there is fair basis for the claims in this case. The claims do not travel beyond the disclosure. The consistory clauses at pages 3 to 3A reflect the language of the claims and provide a fair basis for them: see Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; [2004] 217 CLR 274 at 293-294.</text>

<tocase>Melbourne v Terry Fluid Controls Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 292</tocase>
<text>23 In Melbourne v Terry Fluid Controls Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 292, Jenkinson J decided that the words 'substantial portion' used in a claim to describe a sleeve of a mechanical assembly did not apply to a situation where the portion was less than 50% of the total length. In that case it was 48%. In reaching this conclusion his Honour had regard to context of the complete specification and to the expert evidence concerning the functions which the sleeve was intended to perform in operation of the device.

24 The above interpretation principles are relevant in the present case to a consideration of the particular expressions in the patent specification which Austal submits display uncertainty and lack of clarity. The relevant expressions are found in integers 1.5 and 1.6 and, to a lesser extent, in claim 7.</text>

<text>21 Patent language which uses terms expressing approximation or requiring assessment according to circumstances does necessarily not mean that the impugned claim lacks clarity. Exact expressions are not always essential. An example of this dictum is found in Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 274, where Aickin J said that lack of precise definition in claims is not fatal to validity so long as they provide a workable standard suitable to the intended use. In that case, his Honour did not consider the word 'inextensible' to be imprecise because on its correct construction in the circumstances his Honour considered that it meant 'relatively inextensible' or 'not capable of extending appreciably'. As can been seen from his Honour's use of language in deciding the meaning of the term, his Honour did not shrink from using other words of general connotation.</text>

<tocase>Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471</tocase>
<text>19 There is no significant dispute as to the relevant legal principles of interpretation. It is clear that the claims must not be read in the abstract, but rather in their context, including existing published knowledge. What is being construed is a public instrument which must define a monopoly in such a way that it is not reasonably capable of being misunderstood: Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 476. In Kimberly-Clark Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at 16, the majority joint judgment noted that it is necessary to construe the complete specification in the light of the common general knowledge and the art before the priority date, allowing the Court to place itself in the position of a person reading the specification who is acquainted with the surrounding circumstances as to the state of that art and its manufacture at that time.

53 In order to succeed on the infringement claim, Stena must show that Austal has taken each and every one of the essential integers of the patentee's claim; that is, Stena must show that each of the Austal 94, Austal 196 and Austal 285 vessels possesses all of the essential features of the relevant claims: see Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 475; Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 246 (per Gibbs J).</text>

<tocase>Rhem Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79</tocase>
<text>66 The priority date of the claims is to be determined according to ss 43 and 114 (1) of the Act and regs 3.12 and 3.14 of the Patents Regulations 1991 (Cth) ("Regulations"). The effect of these provisions is that the priority date of the current patent is the filing date in Australia, namely 28 January 1992, unless the Regulations so provide. However, if the claims of the patent are fairly based on matter which is disclosed in the original application document in Sweden, then the priority date will be the date of filing in Sweden, namely 30 January 1991. In other words, if the present claims cover matters which were in substance really and reasonably clearly disclosed, so that the invention as now claimed is broadly described in the body of the original specification considered as a whole, then the priority date will be taken as 30 January 1991: see Pfizer Inc v Commissioner for Patents [2005] FCA 137 ; (2005) 141 FCR 413 at 420; Rhem Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95; Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at 300-301.</text>

<tocase>Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd v Mills &amp; Rockley (Electronics) Ltd [1972] RPC 346</tocase>
<text>73 The High Court at [111] emphasised that it is not the role of a court to substitute its own conclusion for the objective test laid down by ss 7(2) and (3), except in the rarest of circumstances: see also Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd v Mills &amp; Rockley (Electronics) Ltd [1972] RPC 346 at 355 (per Lord Reid). The task for the court is to look forward from the prior art base to what a person skilled in the relevant art is likely to have done when faced with the problem which the patentee claims to have solved. The Court noted at [115]-[116] the importance of secondary evidence when considering whether an inventive step has been achieved. Secondary evidence is that evidence which relates to matters such as the commercial success of the invention, the satisfaction of a long felt want or need, the failure of others to find a solution to the problem and the copying of the invention by competitors. Their Honours at [115] also refer to the necessity for a court to consider the scope and extent of the prior art, and to determine the precise advance over that which was previously in existence, when assessing the level of that prior art.

74 When considering the application of s 7(3) , the Court observed at [152] that attention must be directed to prior disclosures (that is publicly available information which is not part of common general knowledge), which a person skilled in the relevant art could be expected to have regarded as relevant to solving a particular problem. This does not mean that regard must be given to any work in the relevant art whatsoever, but rather only to that information a person skilled in the art could regard as relevant when confronted with the problem faced by the patentee.

75 In this case, it is not the principles relating to 'inventive step' and 'obviousness' which are in dispute, but rather their application. Austal submits that the hull of the invention is only a hybrid combination of desirable features of conventional catamaran hulls and SWATH hulls to produce a multi-hull vessel suitable for high speed operations in exposed seas. The design approach of Stena was not counter-intuitive. A person or team skilled in the art as at the priority date would, when seeking to modify the hull of a catamaran or SWATH into a hull of a so-called semi-SWATH in order to improve seakeeping while retaining speed and stability, design a hull form within the claims without any inventive step. This, Austal submits, demonstrates that the claimed invention is obvious.

76 Austal submits that the relevant prior art base for consideration concerns large high speed multi-hull passenger and cargo vessels suitable for use in exposed sea conditions. It argues that, prior to 30 January 1991, the advantages and disadvantages of both conventional multi-hull catamaran-type vessels and SWATH-type vessels were apparent and known to those in the field. Conventional catamarans were known to be highly efficient with low resistance and capable of high speeds greater than 30 knots. They had broad flat stern sections and were well suited to accommodate large engines, gear boxes and water jets to enable high speed propulsion. In addition, the broad flat stern sections were suitable for loading cargo on and off the stern. One difficulty they suffered, however, was bad seakeeping when operating in exposed waters, which arose from the vertical motion imparted due to the influence of waves.

77 SWATH vessels, on the other hand, had advantages of good seakeeping due to their small water plane area and the ability to move at high speeds (up to about 30 knots). However, SWATH vessels suffered hindrances in the form of limitations on their maximum speed due to high frictional resistance arising from large wetted surface areas. They also had low load stability and involved some engineering complexities, such as difficulty in installing and powering suitable water jet propulsion. As a result of this difficulty with propulsion, they were regarded as unsuitable for use above 30 knots.</text>

<tocase>Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405</tocase>
<text>72 The principles relating to 'inventive step' and 'obviousness' were recently considered by the High Court in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21. In that case, their Honours referred to ss 7(2) and (3) the Act , which describe the statutory test as to what constitutes an 'inventive step'. Their Honours noted at [122] and [150] that the standard by which obviousness is to be determined is by reference to the understanding of a person skilled in the relevant art, who, at the priority relevant date, would possess common general knowledge in that art, and who would have had regard to any additional information referred to in s 7(3): see also Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 188 ALR 280 at 287-289; Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at 414 (per Burchett J). The Court clarified at [152] that s 7(3) has the effect of enlarging the prior art base to include relevant prior disclosures beyond that information which is shown to constitute common general knowledge in that art.</text>
