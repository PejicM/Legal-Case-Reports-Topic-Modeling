<tocase>Advanced Hair Studio Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>32 Section 65A provides an exemption from the application of s 52. That is to say, conduct which would otherwise contravene s 52 does not do so if it is conduct to which s 65A applies. The section provides no exemption for a media organisation which is an accessory to a contravention which is not covered by s 65A. So, if a news organisation aids, abets or induces somebody who is not covered by s 65A to make statements in trade or commerce which are misleading or deceptive and contravene s 52 or one of the State Fair Trading Acts , then the news organisation may be "involved in" that contravention within the meaning of s 75B of the TPA or its equivalent under the relevant Fair Trading Act . That is not to say that a newspaper or other media outlet would be held liable simply for reporting the fact of a statement by a third party which is of itself misleading or deceptive. It is not necessary to consider the conditions of accessorial liability in such a case because that is not the case now before the Court. The proposition remains that there is no protection in s 65A or its Fair Trading Act equivalents against accessorial liability for misleading or deceptive conduct: Advanced Hair Studio Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 1.

33 Section 65A exempts from the application of s 52 "a prescribed publication of matter by a prescribed information provider". The party claiming the exemption must be a prescribed information provider. This means a person "who carries on a business of providing information". The term includes but is not limited to licence holders under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 or who provide broadcasting services under a class licence under that Act. The word "information" is not defined. Its ordinary meaning relevantly includes "knowledge or facts communicated about a particular subject, event etc.; intelligence, news". It also extends to "an item of news": Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (5 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2002).

34 There are no doubt many activities which could involve carrying on a business of providing information. Many, if not most professions and trades which involve the provision of information would no doubt be covered. The limitations on the application of s 65A are not to be found in the definition of prescribed information provider, but rather in subs 65A(1)(a) and (b).</text>

<tocase>Australian Ocean Line Pty Ltd v West Australian Newspapers Ltd (1983) 66 FLR</tocase>
<text>30 Section 65A of the TPA was enacted in 1984 as a response to concerns that news media could be liable for incorrect news reports under the misleading or deceptive conduct provisions of the TPA. This followed the decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Universal Telecasters (Qld) Ltd v Guthrie (1978) 32 FLR 360; Universal Telecasters (Qld) Ltd v Ainsworth Consolidated Industries Ltd (1983) ATPR 40-384 and Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82. In Australian Ocean Line Pty Ltd v West Australian Newspapers Ltd (1983) 66 FLR 453, Toohey J refused to dismiss proceedings against the newspaper for misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to a story it carried about services and conditions aboard a cruise ship, The Dalamacija. Subsequently he made an award of damages against the newspaper: Australian Ocean Line Pty Ltd v West Australian Newspapers Ltd (1985) 58 ALR 549.</text>

<tocase>Carlovers Carwash Ltd v Sahathevan [2000] NSWSC 947</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/947.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The term "freelance journalist" is not explained in the statement of claim. It may be taken to include a person who writes articles for publication in media outlets on the basis that he or she will be paid for articles so published by the relevant media organisation. A freelance journalist is necessarily a person working on his or her own account and not as an employee of a particular media organisation. A person who carries on business as a freelance journalist is plainly within the class of persons described in s 65A as a "prescribed information provider": see Carlovers Carwash Ltd v Sahathevan [2000] NSWSC 947 at [36] (Levine J).

36 In written submissions filed on behalf of Mr Bond and Lesotho Diamond it was argued that "chequebook journalism" is not covered by the s 65A exemption. "Chequebook journalism" is not a term of any statutory significance. It is generally used to describe the practice of media organisations paying non-journalists who happen to have undergone particular experiences to tell the story of their experiences exclusively to the paying organisation for publication by it. So a person who has been involved in some notorious or tragic event or scandal may make himself or herself available, for a fee, to be interviewed exclusively by a particular media organisation who may then publish the interview or a story based upon it. It can be said that selling the story amounts to providing information. That does not however constitute "carrying on the business of providing information". Payment to freelance journalists cannot be equated with the practice of chequebook journalism.

37 The exemption under s 65A applies only to a "prescribed publication of matter". That is a publication by the prescribed information provider "in the course of carrying on a business of providing information". There is a question whether the transmission by a freelance journalist to a media outlet of an article for publication itself constitutes publication.

40 Where more than one construction is open on the statute, that construction should be adopted which is consistent with its purpose. The purpose of s 65A was clearly stated in the Second Reading Speech. To exclude from the exemption the supply of information by freelance journalists to media organisations is to partially defeat that purpose. The communication of news articles to media organisations by freelance journalists is so plainly within the intended purpose of the section that a construction covering it should be adopted provided that construction is open. In my opinion, as stated above, such communication is within the natural and ordinary meaning of publication as publication to the world at large. And even if transmission of an article by a freelance journalist to the editor of a media organisation were to be construed as merely one-to-one communication, the concept of such communication as publication is familiar in the area of defamation law. In Webb v Bloch [1928] HCA 47 ; (1928) 41 CLR 331 Isaacs J said (at 363): 
 
 To publish a libel is to convey by some means to the mind of another the defamatory sense embodied in the vehicle.
 

In Krahe v Freeman (1988) ATPR 40-871 at 49,430, Rogers J, in a passage cited with approval by Levine J in Carlovers [2000] NSWSC 947 at [44] , said: 
 
 
 ... the Fair Trading Act was never meant to be a substitute for actions for defamation. The Parliament has made that clear by the enactment of s 60. In my respectful view, the Court, should be astute not to allow utilisation for a purpose for which it was never intended.</text>

<tocase>Infabrics Ltd v Jaytex Ltd [1981] 1 All ER 1057</tocase>
<text>39 Counsel for Mr Bond and Lesotho Diamond submitted that in relation to copyright law "publishing" and "publication" are "fundamental expressions meaning making available to the public" and that "it would take a great deal of contextual constraint to force them into a narrower and special meaning": Infabrics Ltd v Jaytex Ltd [1981] 1 All ER 1057 at 1061. It was argued that, because s 65A exempts those who fall within it from, amongst other things, the consequences of misleading or deceptive conduct, there is no reason why the Court should adopt an expansive interpretation of the word "publication". It should be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary natural meaning. In my opinion, however, the ordinary and natural meaning of "publication" includes transmission of a news article to a media organisation for publication to the world at large.</text>
