<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/233.html</AustLII>
<text>In written submissions, the respondent contends that the operative order is the order of 6 October 2005. His Honour embarked upon consideration on 19 June 2006 of whether the applicant had complied with the order of 6 October 2005 and having made a finding that the applicant was in default, his Honour declared that the proceeding stood dismissed from 14 October 2005. His Honour did not, on 19 June 2006, dismiss the application. His Honour embarked upon a determination of whether the condition upon which the order rested was satisfied and declared that the order took effect according to its terms. The order of 6 October 2005 is the source of the dismissal of the application. The order is a conflation of two things, namely, an order that the applicant take a step by a certain date and an order that upon default the proceeding 'stands dismissed' as to the whole of the relief claimed by the applicant (see Order 35A, r 2 and r 3). The order made on 19 June 2006 is declaratory of the construction of the order of 6 October 2005 and not, in my view, the operative order of dismissal of the application. See NBGI v MIMIA [2005] FCAFC 233 per Black CJ, Finkelstein and Allsop JJ at [11] and Lenijamar Pty Limited v AGC Advances Limited (1990) 27 FCR 388. Orders 2, 3 and 4 of his Honour's order of 19 June 2006 are operative orders in terms of the subject matter they address.</text>

<tocase>Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp. (1996) 137 ALR 498</tocase>
<text>In this application, the applicant seeks an order staying the orders of 19 June 2006 which comprise four orders. Since order 1 of the orders of 19 June 2006 is not an operative order effecting a dismissal, I do not propose to stay the operation of the declaration as to the effect of the order of 6 October 2005 from the date of the failure to comply with the condition. Order 3 of the order of 19 June 2006 is a refusal of an extension of time for compliance with the order of 6 October 2005. That matter is the subject of leave to appeal. If the appeal is meritorious, the Court has power to set aside order 3 and extend time to enable an amended application to be filed thus reinstating the application. An application to stay a refusal to extend time is apt to be construed as an order extending time. That matter is before the Full Court. The applicant also seeks a stay in respect of the orders of 6 October 2005. I propose to stay order 1 of that order, pending the determination of the appeal (with leave) from the refusal on 19 June 2006 to extend the time for the filing of an amended application, to the extent that the order of 6 October 2005 provides, prospectively, that the application 'stands dismissed'. The respondent does not oppose the application for a stay which I understand to mean that the respondent submits that in exercising the discretion I ought to be satisfied that there is at least an arguable case to be made, although not a persuasive case, in support of the appeal with leave consistent with Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp. (1996) 137 ALR 498 and Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp. Ltd (Receivers Appointed) (1985) 2 NSWLR 685. Prima facie, of course, the judgment appealed from is correct and a successful party is entitled to the benefit of the judgment obtained by him and is entitled to commence with the presumption that the judgment is correct ( Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd (In Liq) (No. 2) [1977] 2 NSWLR 652.</text>
