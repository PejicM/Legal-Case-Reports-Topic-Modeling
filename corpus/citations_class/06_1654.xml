<tocase>Parkin v O'Sullivan [2006] FCA 1413</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1413.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The applicant Director-General of Security seeks leave to appeal from a decision of Sundberg J: Parkin v O'Sullivan [2006] FCA 1413. His Honour directed that the parties confer as to the appropriate orders for discovery and if they were unable to agree that they should file written submissions as to the orders that should be made. In substance, there was an order directing discovery and it is that order against which the Director-General of Security seeks leave to appeal.

2 Under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), I have to exercise a discretion as to the grant of leave.

3 There are two proceedings: Parkin v O'Sullivan (VID 1594 of 2005), and Sagar and Faisal v O'Sullivan (VID 188 of 2006), the discovery applications in which were heard together because they raised similar questions of law. The respondent Mr Parkin is a citizen of the United States of America who entered Australia in June 2005 with a tourist visa valid for six months. According to a public report by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security dated 29 November 2005, Mr Parkin describes himself as "a proponent of non-violent direct action and peaceful civil disobedience against the war in Iraq".

4 His visa was cancelled in September 2005 because of an adverse security assessment issued by the Director-General appointed pursuant to s 7 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth). He was then detained. Some days later, at his own request, he was removed from Australia.

5 In his statement of claim he alleges in par 6 that from time to time, after he entered Australia pursuant to his visa, he "exercised his right to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent within the meaning of s 17A of the ASIO Act".</text>

<text>11 First, there is an arguable case that his Honour did not correctly apply authorities binding on him which say that the bare assertion of a claim without any factual foundation will not justify an order for discovery: Church of Scientology v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25, Lloyd and Costigan (1983) 82 FLR 104 at 113-114, WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1980) 41 FLR 175 at 181, Minister for Immigration v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 at [30] and Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 ; (2005) 148 FCR 255 at 273-274. The last mentioned authority, senior counsel for the Director-General submits, was relied on before his Honour, but not mentioned in the judgment. Moreover, this approach is the more justified in cases where questions of national security are involved; see the Church of Scientology case.</text>
