<tocase>Abebe v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/32.html</AustLII>
<text>46 A few additional words should be said in relation to the Applicant's argument under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). The Respondent accepts that he did not consider the Applicant's registration under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). That is not surprising. He was not asked to do so. The fact that the Applicant did not ask to be registered under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) undermines his assignment of error at both the administrative and judicial review levels. With respect to the administrative level, the rule is that the decision-maker is not obligated to make a party's case for them: Abebe v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] . The Applicant acknowledges this rule but submits that he did make his case in his application for registration that he had "been employed as required by paragraph 198(4)(c) of the [1990 Patents] Act." I do not accept that this general statement was sufficient to put the Respondent on notice that the Applicant was making a case under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). I also do not accept the Applicant's submission that the "Respondent is required at law to consider each of the provisions of 20.3(3) before he can find that a person does not satisfy them." In the absence of evidence or materials that would clearly put an administrative decision-maker on notice of an unarticulated claim, there is no affirmative burden on the decision-maker to scour the papers and the legislation sua sponte to see if there is a basis on which a party's case may succeed: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] - [60] ; Hill v Repatriation Commission (2005) 218 ALR 251 at [105]-[107]. I am satisfied that neither the Applicant's general statements that he had met the employment qualification nor any of the supporting materials he filed with the Respondent were such as to squarely raise his current claim that he was employed as his own (or anyone else's) technical assistant.</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/21.html</AustLII>
<text>10 Before turning to consider each of the grounds of review, it must be noted that, to a significant extent, the Applicant's written and oral submissions proceeded, or at least appeared to proceed, on the premise that the Court's task involved a reconsideration of the merits of the decision. That premise is not correct. As was said by Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36:
 The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone.

11 It is not disputed that the factors the Respondent was required to take into account were affected by the proper construction of reg 20.3(3)(a). The issue was whether the Respondent's construction of reg 20.3(3) (see [6] above) was the proper construction. In my view, subject to one exception which did not affect the Applicant adversely, it was the proper construction.

12 The Respondent concluded that reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) refers to employment in a company or firm in which an employee undertakes patent work for that company or firm and does not extend to include experience in a law firm undertaken on behalf of client companies or firms. Again, subject to one issue which does not affect the outcome of the current application, the Respondent's construction was consistent with the express words of the 1990 Patents Act and the Regulations.

44 The Applicant nevertheless submitted that if that was the object of the legislation and the Regulations, then the regulation is both over and under-inclusive. It is over-inclusive in the Applicant's submission because a person who is employed as a technical assistant for one year but spends the whole year making photocopies will nevertheless qualify for registration even though he or she has gained no experience with patent specifications. It is under-inclusive because a person who has spent a year drafting patent specifications under the supervision of a registered practitioner outside a traditional patent practice or a corporate context (eg at a university legal department) may not qualify for registration. (Whether the Respondent would or should consider a university legal department under those circumstances as a "patent attorney's practice" within the meaning of reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) is an interesting question.) These criticisms, though not without force, do not advance the Applicant's case. Every system of rules-based credentialing, and every bright-line rule generally, suffers from the same flaws: no doubt there are many articled clerks who spend two years in a conference room reviewing documents and never learn to draft a pleading or a contract; and, no doubt, there are many 17 year-olds who are mature enough to vote (and some 19 year-olds who are not). Despite these drawbacks, bright-line rules are preferred over case-by-case decision-making in many instances because it is judged by the rule-making authority where the advantages in administrative efficiency, transparency, and certainty outweigh the disadvantages of over and under-inclusiveness. Ultimately, the Applicant's case boils down to the complaint that the Regulations are unfair and ought to be redrawn. However, the rule the Applicant seeks, whereby an Australian legal practitioner, having provided patent advice for the requisite period, is exempted from having to obtain further work experience in order to become a registered patent attorney, is a matter for government to provide for, not the courts. While the rejection of his application by the Respondent may seem unjust to the Applicant, it must be remembered in considering an application for judicial review that "the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice": Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 36.

45 For the foregoing reasons, the Applicant's construction point fails.</text>

<tocase>Biochem Pharma Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1998) 82 FCR 87</tocase>
<text>29 A number of principles emerge from consideration of these provisions of the 1990 Patents Act . First, the Act recognises the existence and separate roles of registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners: ss 200, 201 and 202. Secondly, both registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners may apply for or obtain patents, prepare documents for the purposes of the 1990 Patents Act and give advice (other than advice of a scientific or technical nature) about the validity or infringement of patents: ss 201 and 202 and see also Biochem Pharma Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1998) 82 FCR 87 , 92 (per Hill J). However, only a registered patent attorney (or a legal practitioner under the instruction of a registered patent attorney) may draft patent specifications or a document relating to an amendment of a specification: s 202. Finally, ss 201(8) to (11) exempt from the area of work restricted to registered patent attorneys, work done for an employer (or a company which is a member of the same group as the person's employer). Accordingly, individuals and companies may prosecute their own patent applications and draft their own patent specifications. The last principle reinforces that reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) of the Act, properly construed, permits experience gained whilst employed by a company engaged in their own patent applications and specifications as relevant experience for the purposes of registration as a patent attorney.

30 None of those provisions support the contention that reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) and / or (ii) should be construed to include a person in the position of the Applicant as having the necessary work experience to qualify as a registered patent attorney. As noted earlier, the 1990 Patents Act clearly marks out the drafting of patent specifications as the exclusive domain of registered patent attorneys. Read in that context, that the three categories of work experience in reg 20.3(3)(a) should be directed toward the acquisition of experience in the construction and drafting of specifications is neither anomalous nor unreasonable.

31 Since 1981, the patents legislation and regulations have been the subject of a number of reviews, recommendations and changes. The Respondent submitted, and I accept, that since the 1980s a number of themes have emerged from the patents legislation and the regulations as they have existed from time to time: first, a concern with protecting the public from unqualified and inexperienced persons undertaking work in relation to patents; secondly, the introduction in the 1980s and the 1990s of increasing degrees of competition; and, thirdly, an attempt to balance those two themes: see Biochem 82 FCR 87 at 88. The balance has been achieved in three ways: (1) acknowledgement that prior to registration as a patent attorney, relevant experience may be gained in the public or private sector; (2) acknowledgement that the business of registered patent attorneys and legal practitioners overlaps but that registered patent attorneys (or legal practitioners under the instruction of a registered patent attorney) retain the exclusive right to draft patent specifications; and (3) adoption of a narrow exemption that permits persons to continue to prosecute their own patent applications or those of their employers.

32 In the early 1980s, the "employment as prescribed" requirement prior to registration was limited to employment for a period by a patent attorney. The period was six months for persons who had previously been employed in the Patents Office as an examiner for a prescribed period and, in other cases, for not less than one year: ss 133(3)(e), 134, 136(1) and (5) and 137 of the 1952 Patents Act and reg 21 of the Patent Attorneys Regulations 1954 (Cth).

33 In a report to the Minister for Science and Technology dated 29 August 1984 from the Industrial Property Advisory Committee entitled "Patents, Innovation and Competition", the Committee recommended, inter alia , that the qualifying period in employment be made a uniform period of 12 months in the public and the private sector: recommendation 39(iii). The Committee explained the role of Patent Attorneys in the following terms (see para 17.1 and 17.5):
 Patent attorneys are a body of professionals specialising in patent law and practice, and particularly in the searching, preparation, and prosecution of patent applications in Australia and abroad. While patent applicants may prosecute their own applications before the Office, patent attorneys have the exclusive right under the Patents Act to prepare specifications for a fee, so they have an effective professional monopoly to handle patent applications. They advise clients in relation to patent validity and infringement and also deal with trade marks, industrial designs, and licensing. The care and skill with which patent applications are prepared materially influence the scope and value of the protection obtained under a patent. The drafting of patent specifications and claims requires special skill and knowledge of the applicable law and practice, as well as a capacity to understand the technology involved. No amount of legal skill will avail if the subject matter is not understood. If Australian inventors are to obtain adequate protection for their inventions here and abroad, the assistance of people possessing these attributes must be available in Australia. ... We have already commented on the important service role which patent attorneys play in preparing and filing patent applications in Australia and abroad. We believe that it is appropriate for the drafting and filing of patent specifications for reward to be the exclusive domain of a trained and regulated professional body. The work is highly technical and it is an integral part of the whole process of effective innovation. ... The Committee therefore accepts that a limited monopoly of practice by patent attorneys should be retained. (Emphasis added.)</text>

<tocase>Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 398</tocase>
<text>19 Nevertheless, the purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22),
 ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is "the ordinary meaning" to be applied. A court cannot depart from "the ordinary meaning" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[.] 
See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 at [44] - [45] (noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning, such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction). The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly, but to a result that is "manifestly absurd" or "unreasonable": Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22; see also Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 398 at [23].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/39.html</AustLII>
<text>47 With respect to the Applicant's attempt to agitate the reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) argument in this Court, "[i]t is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law": SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203 at [13] (citations omitted; emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (stating that failure to timely raise a point may be deemed waiver of that point). In the instant case, it is at best questionable whether all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court. In particular, the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent (which is not surprising, given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence under s 202 of the 1990 Patents Act ): cf Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1141 at [31] (suggesting that a "technical assista nt" is one who has the duty of prosecuting patent applications on behalf of clients, under the supervision of a registered patent attorney). Even accepting the Applicant's statutory declaration at face value, it states only that he has "liaised with patent attorneys in relation to the preparation and filing of patent specifications on behalf of [his] clients." Accordingly, the Applicant's claim under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) would ordinarily fail at the outset both because it was not clearly raised below and because not all of the facts necessary to make good the point have been established beyond controversy.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/63.html</AustLII>
<text>70 None of the considerations raised by the Applicant demonstrated that the decision of the Respondent was invalid. Many of the considerations raised by the Applicant were, in fact, an attack on the merits of the decision and were in relation to facts and matters about which the Respondent and the Applicant held different views. Further, each of the first three matters was addressed and dismissed in relation to the allegation of a denial of natural justice or a lack of procedural fairness. With respect to the fourth matter, it is well settled that the expression of a tentative conclusion without more will not support a claim of apprehended bias; a decision-maker "may form tentative opinions on matters in issue, and counsel are usually assisted by hearing those opinions and being given an opportunity to deal with them": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at [13] (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). Here, the Respondent expressed his tentative opinion to the Applicant in his letter of 9 August 2007 and expressly gave the Applicant an opportunity to respond. After reviewing the Applicant's response, which presumably was assisted and focused by knowledge of the Respondent's tentative opinion, the Respondent then made his decision. Under these circumstances, I do not consider that "a fair-minded lay observer might [have] reasonably apprehend[ed] that the [decision-maker] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the [decision-maker] [wa]s required to decide": Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344 (per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/850.html</AustLII>
<text>52 The Applicant placed considerable emphasis on the absence of the word "registered" in reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). As the Respondent submitted, the omission is "curious". However, the omission does not assist the Applicant for at least two reasons. First, as Heerey J noted in Eli Lilly &amp; Company v Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals (No 2) [2004] FCA 850 ; (2004) 137 FCR 573 at [8] , "registered patent attorneys" in s 200(2) of the 1990 Patents Act means registered in Australia. If that is correct (and it was not suggested that his Honour was wrong), the practical effect of the omission may be no more than a recognition that applicants who have worked overseas as a technical assistant for a patent attorney who is not registered under the 1990 Patents Act , may still satisfy the employment requirement of reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). Secondly, even if it were accepted that reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) is not referring to a registered patent attorney (a submission I do not accept), the Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has been employed as a technical assistant in the practice of a patent attorney, practicing as a patent attorney within the meaning of s 201 of the 1990 Patents Act . As a matter of ordinary English syntax, one cannot be employed as an assistant to oneself; thus the Applicant cannot satisfy the criterion of having been employed as a technical assistant in a patent attorney's practice.</text>

<text>68 In Eshetu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 71 FCR 300 , reversed on other grounds by Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 , Burchett J (at 317) accepted the definition of natural justice to be commensurate with the statement of principle in Butterworths Legal Dictionary (ed Nygh P, and Butt, P):
 The right to be given a fair hearing and the opportunity to present one's case, the right to have a decision made by an unbiased or disinterested decision maker and the right to have the decision based on logically probative evidence. ...

69 The Applicant did not seek to submit that the current circumstances (or any other feature of the matter) founded a case of actual bias. The Amended Application merely asserted apprehended bias. In fact, the Applicant sought, impermissibly, to use this ground to re-agitate the merits of the decision by reference to four matters: (1) that relevant documents were allegedly destroyed; (2) the manner in which the Applicant was described in documents by the Acting Secretary to lack credibility or have a credibility gap (without being given the opportunity to respond) and to have "strayed" into the field of patents; (3) that the Respondent's decision was described by the Acting Secretary as "judicially excellent" and (4) that the decision-maker had expressly made his thoughts known about the operation of reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii).</text>

The Respondent accepts that he did not consider the Applicant's registration under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). That is not surprising. He was not asked to do so. The fact that the Applicant did not ask to be registered under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) undermines his assignment of error at both the administrative and judicial review levels.

<text>22 The Applicant contended that the reference to "in a company" should not be read literally but should be extended to include employment " in a company or a firm" . The Respondent adopted that construction in par 5.8 of his reasons for decision (see [7] above). I do not accept that references in reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) to "company" should be read in that manner. A law firm, other than an incorporated legal practice, is not a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act ": see ss 9 and 119 (stating that a company means a company registered under the Corporations Act and comes into existence as a body corporate on the day of registration); Legal Profession Act 2004 (Vic) ss 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 (stating that an incorporated legal practice is a company within the meaning of the Corporations Act ). The Applicant accepted that his firm is not registered under the Corporations Act . Moreover, even assuming that the definition found in the Corporations Act should not be interpolated into reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii), the ordinary common law understanding of company would not assist the Applicant either: Macleod v Queen [2003] HCA 24 ; (2003) 214 CLR 230 at [28] (stating that the essential meaning of "company" since the time of Salomon's Case , has been as a body with a separate legal identity); see also Sons of Gwalia Ltd v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 525 at [3] - [4] (observing the historical distinction, dating back to Salomon's Case , between firms (partnerships) and companies (corporations)); Salomon v Salomon &amp; Co Ltd [1897] AC 22.

"Credible, relevant and significant" material is "information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision": VEAL [2005] HCA 72 ; 225 CLR 88 at [17] . As the Respondent's letters of 9 August 2007, 10 and 11 October 2007, and 22 November 2007 demonstrate, the Respondent took the consistent view that the Applicant did not satisfy the requirements of reg 20.3(3)(a) based on a plain reading of the regulation. There is no evidence that the Respondent could not or did not dismiss from further consideration the Acting Secretary's opinions of the Applicant's material, given that his 11 October 2007 rejection of the Applicant's application was for the same reason as his 9 August 2007 tentative rejection - namely, that even accepting that all of the material provided by the Applicant was true and correct, the Applicant failed as a matter of law to satisfy the requirements of reg 20.3(3)(a) - and did not turn on any credibility or evidentiary issues. That the Respondent had already tentatively reached that view before ever receiving the October memoranda from the Acting Secretary conclusively demonstrates that the memoranda played no part, much less a significant one, in the Respondent's consideration or decision.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597</tocase>
<text>66 No decision was made to register the Applicant on 7 August 2007 because it is clear from the face of the document that the Respondent was directing only that the three persons whose names were ticked be registered while the two persons without ticks were not to be registered due to the handwritten reasons. However, even if a "decision" had been made (and it had not), the Applicant would be in no better position because the Applicant did not satisfy reg 20.3(3)(a). Any "decision" would have been a "decision" in error and without legal foundation. Accordingly, the Respondent would not have been prevented from making a later decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [51], [52] and [54].

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/263.html</AustLII>
<text>46 A few additional words should be said in relation to the Applicant's argument under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). The Respondent accepts that he did not consider the Applicant's registration under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). That is not surprising. He was not asked to do so. The fact that the Applicant did not ask to be registered under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) undermines his assignment of error at both the administrative and judicial review levels. With respect to the administrative level, the rule is that the decision-maker is not obligated to make a party's case for them: Abebe v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] . The Applicant acknowledges this rule but submits that he did make his case in his application for registration that he had "been employed as required by paragraph 198(4)(c) of the [1990 Patents] Act." I do not accept that this general statement was sufficient to put the Respondent on notice that the Applicant was making a case under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i). I also do not accept the Applicant's submission that the "Respondent is required at law to consider each of the provisions of 20.3(3) before he can find that a person does not satisfy them." In the absence of evidence or materials that would clearly put an administrative decision-maker on notice of an unarticulated claim, there is no affirmative burden on the decision-maker to scour the papers and the legislation sua sponte to see if there is a basis on which a party's case may succeed: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] - [60] ; Hill v Repatriation Commission (2005) 218 ALR 251 at [105]-[107]. I am satisfied that neither the Applicant's general statements that he had met the employment qualification nor any of the supporting materials he filed with the Respondent were such as to squarely raise his current claim that he was employed as his own (or anyone else's) technical assistant.</text>

<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/57.html</AustLII>
<text>23 To the extent that the Respondent considered that employment in a firm could be considered employment in a company for the purposes of the regulation, it follows that he took an irrelevant consideration into account. However, that error may be put to one side because, on any view, it was an error which favoured the Applicant. If a proper construction of reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) had been adopted, the result would not have been any different and thus the error was harmless: Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [104] (stating that relief on judicial review will be refused where the court is satisfied that the error did not affect the outcome of the administrative decision).

24 I now turn to a more detailed consideration of the purpose and context of the 1990 Patents Act as foreshadowed above. As these reasons for decision will demonstrate, there is nothing in the other provisions of the 1990 Patents Act or the Regulations, or the historical materials, which suggests, let alone supports, the Applicant's construction of reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) or (ii). On the contrary, those materials all demonstrate that it was the intention of the Parliament that a person in the position of the Applicant should not be registered as a patent attorney.

25 Section 198 forms part of Pt 1 of Ch 20 of the 1990 Patents Act . Chapter 20 is entitled "Patent Attorneys". Part 1 is entitled "Registration, Privileges and Professional Conduct". Offences are dealt with in Pt 2.

53 The failure by the decision maker to consider this issue thus does not assist the Applicant because consideration of it would not have led to a different result: Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; 204 CLR 82 at [104] . For these additional reasons, the Applicant's construction point fails.

54 The allegations were put on three bases: (1) that the Respondent "admit[ted] that the Respondent had deleted all the relevant emails which may have clearly established bias"; (2) to the extent that the Respondent had discovered materials, that documentation revealed that the Respondent did not wish to meet the applicant and the material contained other matters detrimental to the Applicant; and (3) the decision-maker had expressly made his thoughts known about the operation of reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii).

55 These grounds of review are also without merit, both independently and because, even if made out, they could not change the outcome in light of my conclusions on the proper construction of reg 20.3(3)(a) set out above.</text>

<tocase>Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/21.html</AustLII>
<text>18 I cannot accept such a construction. It is true that s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) directs a court to prefer a construction promoting the purpose or object of an Act. It is also true that patent textual ambiguity is not required in order to consult purpose (ie reference to purpose may be had both to raise as well as to resolve ambiguity): Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 22; see also Kowalski v Domestic Violence Crisis Centre Inc [2001] FCA 1082 ; (2001) 113 FCR 67 at [23] .

19 Nevertheless, the purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22),
 ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is "the ordinary meaning" to be applied. A court cannot depart from "the ordinary meaning" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[.] 
See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 at [44] - [45] (noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning, such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction). The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly, but to a result that is "manifestly absurd" or "unreasonable": Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22; see also Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 398 at [23].

43 As noted earlier, a review of the statutory context, legislative history, and legislative purpose reveals an attempt to balance two competing objects: (1) the need to reduce barriers to entry and competition and thus reduce costs of patent attorney services; while (2) maintaining strict professional qualification requirements and thus safeguarding the public interest in receiving only high quality services. This understanding of context and purpose does not throw doubt on the construction of reg 20.3(3)(a) such as required by the High Court in Saraswati to justify judicial amendment of a statute or regulation that departs from the ordinary meaning. The legislative and regulatory scheme has hit on a compromise whereby in-house corporate patent practice (which would tend to be focused much more on out-of-court matters such as patent drafting and prosecution), but not ordinary law firm practice (which would tend to focus more on the giving of advice with respect to court-related matters such as validity and infringement proceedings), satisfies the registration requirements. This is entirely consistent with a legislative objective of partial deregulation while ensuring that high standards are maintained with respect to the complex technical arena of patent drafting and prosecution.</text>

<text>22 The Applicant contended that the reference to "in a company" should not be read literally but should be extended to include employment " in a company or a firm" . The Respondent adopted that construction in par 5.8 of his reasons for decision (see [7] above). I do not accept that references in reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) to "company" should be read in that manner.

The Applicant accepted that his firm is not registered under the Corporations Act .

<text>47 With respect to the Applicant's attempt to agitate the reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) argument in this Court, "[i]t is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law": SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203 at [13] (citations omitted; emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (stating that failure to timely raise a point may be deemed waiver of that point). In the instant case, it is at best questionable whether all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court. In particular, the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent (which is not surprising, given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence under s 202 of the 1990 Patents Act ): cf Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1141 at [31] (suggesting that a "technical assista nt" is one who has the duty of prosecuting patent applications on behalf of clients, under the supervision of a registered patent attorney). Even accepting the Applicant's statutory declaration at face value, it states only that he has "liaised with patent attorneys in relation to the preparation and filing of patent specifications on behalf of [his] clients." Accordingly, the Applicant's claim under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) would ordinarily fail at the outset both because it was not clearly raised below and because not all of the facts necessary to make good the point have been established beyond controversy.</text>

62 Finally, a number of the Applicant's allegations proceeded on the basis that the Respondent was under an obligation to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to comment on documents (specifically, memoranda from the Acting Secretary of the Professional Standards Board for Patent and Trade Marks Attorneys dated 4 October and 11 October 2007) which contain no more than opinions on, or rejections of, the Applicant's material. That premise is wrong. An applicant in an administrative context is entitled to comment only on adverse information that is "credible, relevant and significant": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at 88-90 and VEAL [2005] HCA 72 ; 225 CLR 88 at [15] and [17]. "Credible, relevant and significant" material is "information that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision": VEAL [2005] HCA 72 ; 225 CLR 88 at [17] . As the Respondent's letters of 9 August 2007, 10 and 11 October 2007, and 22 November 2007 demonstrate, the Respondent took the consistent view that the Applicant did not satisfy the requirements of reg 20.3(3)(a) based on a plain reading of the regulation. There is no evidence that the Respondent could not or did not dismiss from further consideration the Acting Secretary's opinions of the Applicant's material, given that his 11 October 2007 rejection of the Applicant's application was for the same reason as his 9 August 2007 tentative rejection - namely, that even accepting that all of the material provided by the Applicant was true and correct, the Applicant failed as a matter of law to satisfy the requirements of reg 20.3(3)(a) - and did not turn on any credibility or evidentiary issues. That the Respondent had already tentatively reached that view before ever receiving the October memoranda from the Acting Secretary conclusively demonstrates that the memoranda played no part, much less a significant one, in the Respondent's consideration or decision.</text>
