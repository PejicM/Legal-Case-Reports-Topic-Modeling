<tocase>Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (In Liq) v McDermott [2006] FCA 52</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/52.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The applicants in this matter, Robert McDermott, Maxwell Latimer and Ann Langdon, were defendants in an earlier proceeding before me. That proceeding began as an ex-parte application, filed by Paul Burness as liquidator of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd ("Richmond Sales"), for a warrant under s 530C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The procedural history of that matter is outlined in reasons for judgment delivered on 8 February 2006: see Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (In Liq) v McDermott [2006] FCA 52 at [2] - [19] .

2 It is unnecessary to review all of the procedural history of the earlier proceeding involving these parties. For the present purposes, the following facts are relevant:
 
 &#8226; Merkel J issued a warrant on 4 December 2003 and it was served the next day. Pursuant to the warrant, Burness seized seven vehicles
 &#8226; On 24 March 2004, Burness filed an interlocutory application asking that he be directed to sell the seven seized vehicles.
 &#8226; By 15 December 2004, only three vehicles remained in Burness's possession and the subject of dispute. McDermott, Latimer and Langdon, as defendants, opposed the sale of these vehicles.
 &#8226; Burness's application to dispose of the vehicles was part heard on 12 and 13 July 2005. 
 &#8226; On 29 August 2005, McDermott, Latimer and Langdon, together with fellow defendants Michael Giuffre, John McDonald and Mary-Ann Martinek, filed an application seeking to set aside the warrant issued on 4 December 2003.
 &#8226; On 10 October 2005, the parties informed the Court that they had reached a settlement concerning Burness's application of 24 March 2004 to dispose of the seized vehicles. The parties requested that the Court make consent orders consistent with the terms of this settlement. Accordingly, amongst other things on that day the Court ordered:
 "1. The motor vehicle identified as a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost chassis No. 2316 which is in the possession of the Plaintiff be delivered to the Defendant nominated by Walter Percival Edwards at an address in Melbourne specified by him forthwith upon nomination of that Defendant. 
 
 2. In the event that the Defendants pay the sum of $33,000.00 to the Plaintiff on or before 31 January 2006 the Plaintiff deliver the motor vehicles identified as a Rolls Royce Phantom II Sedan chassis No. 39GY and a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow II Saloon chassis No. SRH0040192 to the Defendant or Defendants nominated by Walter Percival Edwards at an address specified by him within 48 hours of receipt of the said sum. 
 
 2A. In the event that the Defendants fail to pay the sum of $33,000.00 to the Plaintiff on or before 31 January 2006 the motor vehicles referred to in paragraph 2 hereof be the absolute property of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (in liquidation) and the liquidator of that company be at liberty to sell those vehicles and retain the proceeds of sale as absolute property of the company in liquidation. 
 
 2B. Reserve liberty to the parties to apply." 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; On 10 October 2005, the Court also made orders concerning the timing of submissions regarding the defendants' application of 29 August 2005 to set aside the warrant.
 &#8226; On 8 February 2006, the Court delivered reasons for judgment dismissing the defendants' application to set aside the warrant.

3 On 23 February 2006, the applicants filed this application, under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), seeking that paragraphs 2 and 2A of the orders of 10 October 2005 be varied. The applicants ask the Court to extend the time for payment of the sum of $33,000.</text>

<tocase>Westsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd (No 2) (1990) 94 ALR 310</tocase>
<text>8 In his second affidavit, Edwards deposed that:
 
 "Pursuant to the Court Orders made by consent on 10 October 2005 the Liquidator failed to deliver Vehicle 2316 to the person that I nominated (as specified in clause 1 of the Orders) until some two weeks after the making of the order. 
 
 On 31 January 2006 I informed McDermott's Workshop of my trust account details as he had indicated to me that he was providing by direct transfer of funds the amount of $33,000.00 being the sum required to payout the Liquidator pursuant to clause 2 of the 10 October 2005 orders. ... 
 
 Funds were shown as having been 'cleared' into my trust account on 1 February 2006. 
 
 I informed the Applicants that I had received the funds into my trust account on 1 February 2006, however, the Applicants indicated to me that the funds were in fact deposited into my trust account on 31 January 2006." 
 

Counsel for the applicants submitted that the Court has the power to vary the order under O 35 r 7(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 which allows the Court to "vary or set aside a judgment or order after the order has been entered where . . . the order is interlocutory." The applicants argued that the consent orders were interlocutory because they included an order reserving liberty to apply. Counsel for the applicants also relied on O 35 r 7(4) (and, in this connection, Westsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd (No 2) (1990) 94 ALR 310) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.

9 In the applicants' view, a number of factors support the conclusion that this is an appropriate case to exercise the discretion conferred by O 35 r 7(2) or O 35 r 7(4) or in the Court's inherent jurisdiction. First, so the applicants claimed, the consent orders show that the intention of the parties was that $33,000 be exchanged for the relevant vehicles. Secondly, this money was available to be transferred to the respondents on 31 January 2006 (or at the latest 1 February 2006). Thirdly, according to the applicants, the reason that the money was not delivered on 31 January 2006 was that, contrary to both parties' expectations, reasons for judgment regarding the application to set aside the warrant were not delivered until after than date. Fourthly, the money is available to be paid immediately. Fifthly, the respondents would not, so the applicants said, be prejudiced by a variation in the order. Sixthly, having regard to the liquidator's own delay in delivering vehicle 2316, there should have been no difficulty in the parties agreeing to disregard the delay on the applicants' side. Finally, if the time were not extended, then the liquidator would, so the applicants said, receive a windfall gain not intended by the settlement giving rise to the orders of 10 October 2005.

10 The applicants conceded that they had not paid the $33,000 before 31 January 2006 because they expected a different result in the application to set aside the warrant. They argued that while this view may have been "na&iuml;ve", they should not suffer prejudice as a consequence. They also sought the costs of their application.

23 The orders in paragraphs 2 and 2A of the orders of 10 October 2005 were final orders with respect to the application of 24 March 2004. Thus, the Court has no power to vary these orders pursuant to O 35 r 7(2). Further, the Court has no power under O 35 r 7(4) to make the orders the applicant seeks. As a Full Court said in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (in liq) v White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd (1993) 117 ALR 253 at 264 per Lee, Hill and Cooper JJ, regarding O 35 r 7(4), "[c]ritical to the jurisdiction of the court is first that the application not be one in any way to vary or alter the initial order". The applicants seek orders to vary the orders in paragraphs 2 and 2A of the 10 October 2006 orders; and O 35 r 7(4) does not give power to do this. In the face of Full Court authority, the earlier decision in Westsub Discounts Pty Ltd v Idaps Australia Ltd (No 2) (1990) 94 ALR 310 is either to be distinguished or is no longer good authority.</text>

<tocase>Lindon v Stanton (Supreme Court of Western Australia (Adams M), 27 November 1992, BC9200887)</tocase>
<text>16 The respondents further submitted that a consent order giving effect to a settlement could only be set aside on grounds that would justify setting aside the contractual agreement on which the settlement was based. In support of this proposition, they referred to Lindon v Stanton (Supreme Court of Western Australia (Adams M), 27 November 1992, BC9200887).

17 The respondents also argued that the applicants received no support from O 35 r 7(4) and nor could they avail themselves of the Court's inherent jurisdiction. They contended that O 35 r 7(4) conferred power to make orders that were truly supplemental and did not confer power to vary or alter the initial order.

18 Ultimately, so the respondent said, the applicants made a decision not to pay before the end of January. This decision was based on the applicants' view that it was not in their interest to pay the money at that time. The respondents submitted that they should not be penalized for the applicants' error. The respondents noted that they would be prejudiced by any variation of the kind sought in the orders of 10 October 2006 because the vehicles were likely to be worth more than $33,000.</text>

<tocase>Nicholson v Nicholson [1974] 2 NSWLR 59</tocase>
<text>14 At the hearing, the respondents contended that O 35 r 7(2)(c) did not provide a basis for the orders sought. They submitted that paragraphs 1, 2 and 2A of the orders of 10 October 2005 were final rather than interlocutory. They noted that the orders finally disposed of the subject matter of the 24 March 2004 application. They cited Nicholson v Nicholson [1974] 2 NSWLR 59 in support of the proposition that reservation of liberty to apply, in the context of such orders, is simply a device by which further orders may be made when necessary for the purpose of implementing and giving effect to the principal relief already propounded. The respondents submitted that the reservation of liberty to apply in a final judgment or order did not permit the making of orders materially varying the substance of the order.

15 The respondents submitted that the orders made in paragraphs 1, 2 and 2A of the 10 October 2006 orders were final and unconditional, like the settlement agreement underlying them. Crucially, there was no condition that the settlement was dependent on the outcome of the defendants' application to set aside the warrant. In these circumstances, there was no reason to believe that the delay in payment that the applicants sought was consistent with the orders or the settlement.

22 Moreover, it is settled law that orders may be final even though the Court reserves liberty to apply: see, e.g., Abigroup Limited v Abignano (1992) 39 FCR 74 at 87-88 per Lockhart, Morling and Gummow JJ; Comcare v Grimes (1994) 50 FCR 60 at 61-62 per Wilcox J; Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority (No 3) (2001) 106 IR 119 at 122-125 per Nicholson J; and Nicholson v Nicholson [1974] 2 NSWLR 59 at 63 per Jenkyn J. These cases reveal that liberty to apply does not render a final order any less final: see further Neil J Williams, Civil Procedure at [I 59.01.20] and the cases cited therein.</text>

The principle of finality of litigation requires courts to exercise great caution when considering whether exceptional circumstances exist warranting the variation of orders: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-552 per von Doussa, Moore and Sackville JJ.
