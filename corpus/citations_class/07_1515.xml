<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/10.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The Court's task in construing a certified agreement such as the 2005 Enterprise Agreement was described by the High Court in Amcor Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] HCA 10 ; (2005) 222 CLR 241 at [30] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). Adapting the language of that paragraph, the question of construction is to be resolved as follows:
 
 
 "[Clause 17.4] must be read in context. It is necessary, therefore, to have regard not only to the text of [cl 17.4], but also to a number of other matters: first, the other provisions made by [cl 17]; secondly, the text and operation of the [2005 Enterprise Agreement] both as a whole and by reference to other particular provisions made by it; and, thirdly, the legislative background against which the [2005 Enterprise Agreement] was made and in which it was to operate."

<tocase>Ansett Australia Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers' Association [2003] FCAFC 209 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/209.html</AustLII>
<text>43 The Court's adoption of a "purposive" approach to the interpretation of statutory instruments, awards and certified agreements has been explained by various courts: Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 ; (2006) 154 FCR 185 at [66] [69]; Ansett Australia Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association [2003] FCAFC 209 at [8] ; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (1998) 80 IR 208 at 212 and Hawkins v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) (1996) 70 IR 213 at 218. In Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184, Madgwick J put the point in the following terms:
 
 
 "It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced. The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon. Thus, for example, it is justifiable to read the award to give effect to its evident purposes, having regard to such context, despite mere inconsistencies or infelicities of expression which might tend to some other reading. And meanings which avoid inconvenience or injustice may reasonably be strained for. For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand. 
 
 But the task remains one of interpreting a document produced by another or others. A court is not free to give effect to some anteriorly derived notion of what would be fair or just, regardless of what has been written into the award. Deciding what an existing award means is a process quite different from deciding, as an arbitral body does, what might fairly be put into an award. So, for example, ordinary or well-understood words are in general to be accorded their ordinary or usual meaning."</text>
