<tocase>Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656</tocase>
<text>52 The very existence of any such duty and -- if any such duty existed -- the content of the duty had thus to be addressed as a matter of general principle. As a matter of general principle it was common ground that:
 
(a) the duty owed by a director to his company is fiduciary in character (eg, Australian Growth Resources Corp Pty Ltd v Van Reesema (1988) 13 ACLR 261 at 268 per King CJ); 
 
(b) the duty includes a duty to act bona fide and in the best interests of the company (eg, Darvall v North Sydney Brick &amp; Tile Co Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 260 at 270 per Kirby P; Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671);
 
(c) the discharge of that duty may involve a right on the part of a director to inspect those documents relevant to the discharge of the duty (eg, Edman v Ross (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 351 ; Molomby v Whitehead [1985] FCA 421 ; (1985) 7 FCR 541 at 550 per Beaumont J);
 
(d) the discharge of the duty involves a director becoming familiar with how the company conducts its business (eg, Daniels v Anderson (1995) 37 NSWLR 438 at 500 1); and 
 
(e) a director who occupies the position of chairman may have additional rights and duties, including a duty of selecting documents to be placed before the board for its consideration and keeping the board fully informed (cf Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 at 225 per Mahoney JA). 
 
Reference should also be made to ss 180 to 184 of the Corporations Act and to Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [8-010] and [8-065] [8-090] (13 th ed, 2007). The statutory duties imposed by ss 181 and 182 reflect, and to some extent refine, corresponding obligations on directors under the general law: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell [2006] NSWSC 1052 at [99] , [2006] NSWSC 1052 ; 59 ACSR 373 at 397. See also: Austin R, Ford H and Ramsay I, Company Directors: Principles of Law and Corporate Governance (2005) at [7.4]. Beyond recognition of these general principles, the potential existed in the present proceeding for submissions to descend to a level of unnecessary abstraction.</text>

<tocase>Aussie Home Security Pty Ltd v Sales Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 498 , 172 ALR 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/498.html</AustLII>
<text>76 On this approach, the indemnity in respect of legal costs incurred in the present " proceeding " was not denied by s 199A(3)(a) and (2)(a). Emphasis was placed upon an accepted difference between a Statement of Claim as an originating process and a Cross-Claim . Indeed, it could also have been advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus that a Cross-Claim has been accepted as itself constituting a " proceeding " in its own right such that in the present matter before the Court there may have been two " proceedings ": cf Aussie Home Security Pty Ltd v Sales Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 498 at [5] , [2000] FCA 498 ; 172 ALR 141 at 143 per Katz J. On such an approach, the " proceeding " in which the liability of Mr Rickus was established was a different " proceeding " to the one commenced by the Applicants; and, in his own " proceeding ", Mr Rickus was neither " defending " nor " resisting " any liability.

77 Whether there be one " proceeding " before the Court or two " proceedings ", it is not considered that the legislative objective set forth in s 199A(3)(a) is to be resolved by such subtleties. The legislative objective is reasonably clear -- an officer or auditor of a company is not to be indemnified in respect to such legal costs as he incurs in defending or resisting proceedings seeking to establish the existence of the liability in issue. At all material times the Trustee was asserting a right to have a copy of the documents produced. At all materials times Mr Rickus was resisting or denying any such right on the part of the Trustee and any duty on his part to produce a copy. A " proceeding " was instituted seeking to establish the liability denied. A further " proceeding " in the form of the Cross-Claim , it may be accepted, was also instituted. The very forensic purpose of the Cross-Claim was to resist the demand for the production of a copy of the documents. Such conduct, it is considered, falls within s 199A(3)(a). The duty or obligation to produce a copy of the documents can properly be characterised as a " liability " owed to the company.

78 It is also separately considered that the fact that that finding has been made in resolution of the Cross-Claim does not lead to any different conclusion as to the application of s 199A(3)(a). The Cross-Claim was but the vehicle whereby it was found that Mr Rickus was under a " liability owed to the company ". It may be considered to be a curious result if a director of a company could otherwise escape the application of s 199A(3)(a) by simply filing a Cross-Claim in any " proceeding " in which a " liability " is sought to be established and inviting the Court to enter judgment -- either for or against him -- in the Cross-Claim and not the originating application. The object or purpose of s 199A(3) could, by such a means, potentially be thwarted.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 , 160 FCR 35</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/963.html</AustLII>
<text>70 A more generally expressed submission advanced by the Trustee that it was a part of the fiduciary duty owed by a director to make full disclosure is rejected. " The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information ": Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 at [375] , [2007] FCA 963 ; 160 FCR 35 at 88 per Jacobson J. Reference may also be made to one of the authorities there referred to by His Honour, namely Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71. Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed (at 113):
 In this country, fiduciary obligations arise because a person has come under an obligation to act in another's interests. As a result, equity imposes on the fiduciary proscriptive obligations -- not to obtain any unauthorised benefit from the relationship and not to be in a position of conflict. If these obligations are breached, the fiduciary must account for any profits and make good any losses arising from the breach. But the law of this country does not otherwise impose positive legal duties on the fiduciary to act in the interests of the person to whom the duty is owed. If there was a general fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the patient, it would necessarily follow that a doctor has a duty to inform the patient that he or she has breached their contract or has been guilty of negligence in dealings with the patient. That is not the law of this country. 
Gummow J concluded (at 137 8):
 Fiduciary obligations arise (albeit perhaps not exclusively) in various situations where it may be seen that one person is under an obligation to act in the interests of another. Equitable remedies are available where the fiduciary places interest in conflict with duty or derives an unauthorised profit from abuse of duty. It would be to stand established principle on its head to reason that because equity considers the defendant to be a fiduciary, therefore the defendant has a legal obligation to act in the interests of the plaintiff so that failure to fulfil that positive obligation represents a breach of fiduciary duty.

<text>53 In some circumstances, for example, it has been said that it is " the duty of the general manager and (possibly) of the chairman to go carefully through the returns from the branches, and to bring before the board any matter requiring their consideration ": Dover v Cory [1901] AC 477. There being addressed was the responsibility of a director to inform himself as to the records of the company as opposed to the reliance he could place upon a chairman or a general manager in identifying those matters requiring his consideration. Lord Davey concluded as follows (at 492 3):
 In this state of the evidence, my Lords, I ask whether the course of business at the board meetings, as described by the respondent, was a reasonable course to be pursued by the respondent, and other directors, or whether the knowledge which might have been derived from a careful and comparative examination of the weekly states and quarterly returns from the different branches of the bank ought to be imputed to the respondent, or (alternatively) whether he was guilty of such neglect of his duty as a director as would render him liable to damages. I do not think that it is made out that either of the two latter questions should be answered in the affirmative. I think the respondent was bound to give his attention to and exercise his judgment as a man of business on the matters which were brought before the board at the meetings which he attended, and it is not proved that he did not do so. But I think he was entitled to rely upon the judgment, information, and advice of the chairman and general manager, as to whose integrity, skill, and competence he had no reason for suspicion. I agree with what was said by Sir George Jessel in Hallmark's Case [(1878) 9 Ch D 329] , and by Chitty J. in In re Denham &amp; Co. [(1883) 25 Ch D 752] , that directors are not bound to examine entries in the company's books. It was the duty of the general manager and (possibly) of the chairman to go carefully through the returns from the branches, and to bring before the board any matter requiring their consideration; but the respondent was not, in my opinion, guilty of negligence in not examining them for himself, notwithstanding that they were laid on the table of the board for reference. ... 
In other circumstances it has been said that a " chairman has the primary responsibility of selecting matters and documents to be brought to the board's attention ": AWA Ltd v Daniels (1992) 7 ACSR 759 at 867. More recently, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2003] NSWSC 85 at [51] [72], 174 FLR 128 at 141 7, Austin J has reviewed the authorities and considered the duties owed by a chairman of a listed company.

<text>98 Contrary to the submission of Mr Rickus, there is no " general rule " that a party who discontinues a proceeding with the leave of the Court pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules should normally pay the costs occasioned by the discontinuance. It may be accepted that a Court will normally allow a party to discontinue a proceeding if he wants to, provided no injustice will be caused to his opponent. " It is not desirable that a plaintiff should be compelled to litigate against his will ": O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [11] per Finn J. But there is no " general rule ", such as suggested on behalf of Mr Rickus, and the order as to costs remains in the discretion of the Court: Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 at [39] , [2005] FCA 997 ; 146 FCR 37 at 48 per Stone J. Where there has been no hearing on the merits and where both parties have acted reasonably, a proper exercise of the discretion may be to make no order as to costs: Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 625 per McHugh J. The approach there pursued by McHugh J has been accepted as an appropriate test to apply when proceedings are discontinued under O 22 r 2(1)(d): Mineralogy Pty Ltd v National Native Title Tribunal [1998] FCA 1700. It is no part of the function of the Court when a proceeding is discontinued " to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case ": Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] per Rares J.</text>

<tocase>Craddock v Sweeney [2005] QSC 037</tocase>
<text>33 That phrase, the Trustee contends, imposes a requirement to satisfy each of the two requirements, namely that the liability must be incurred by reason of Mr Rickus holding office, and also the requirement that the liability must be incurred whilst he was acting in the capacity as an officer of the Trustee. The construction of any individual deed must obviously depend upon the terms of the deed under consideration. But the construction now being advanced on behalf of the Trustee is consistent with a conclusion expressed in respect to a comparable provision in Craddock v Sweeney [2005] QSC 037 at [18].

34 In the present proceeding, the Trustee contends that Mr Rickus cannot bring himself within this phrase because he ceased to be a director of the Trustee on 10 December 2006 and the present proceeding was not commenced until September 2007. At the time the liability to costs was incurred it is contended that Mr Rickus was not a director and was not " acting in the capacity of an officer of the Company ".

35 It is not considered that this argument should prevail. Clause 2.2 confers an indemnity in respect to a " liability for legal costs ". The indemnity extends to the payment of such costs " in respect of a Liability incurred ... by virtue of holding office as and acting in the capacity of an officer of the Company ". The " Liability " there referred to is the " Liability " to accede to the claim for the return of the documents. At the time the documents were produced by Mr Rickus to the Authority, and at the time the first demand was made for the return of those documents, and that demand was resisted, Mr Rickus remained a director of the Trustee. Indeed, it was because he was a director that the Trustee maintains that he was under a duty to return the documents or a copy of the documents.</text>

(d) the discharge of the duty involves a director becoming familiar with how the company conducts its business (eg, Daniels v Anderson (1995) 37 NSWLR 438 at 500 1); and 
 
(e) a director who occupies the position of chairman may have additional rights and duties, including a duty of selecting documents to be placed before the board for its consideration and keeping the board fully informed (cf Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 at 225 per Mahoney JA).

<tocase>Dover v Cory [1901] AC 477</tocase>
<text>53 In some circumstances, for example, it has been said that it is " the duty of the general manager and (possibly) of the chairman to go carefully through the returns from the branches, and to bring before the board any matter requiring their consideration ": Dover v Cory [1901] AC 477. There being addressed was the responsibility of a director to inform himself as to the records of the company as opposed to the reliance he could place upon a chairman or a general manager in identifying those matters requiring his consideration. Lord Davey concluded as follows (at 492 3):
 In this state of the evidence, my Lords, I ask whether the course of business at the board meetings, as described by the respondent, was a reasonable course to be pursued by the respondent, and other directors, or whether the knowledge which might have been derived from a careful and comparative examination of the weekly states and quarterly returns from the different branches of the bank ought to be imputed to the respondent, or (alternatively) whether he was guilty of such neglect of his duty as a director as would render him liable to damages. I do not think that it is made out that either of the two latter questions should be answered in the affirmative. I think the respondent was bound to give his attention to and exercise his judgment as a man of business on the matters which were brought before the board at the meetings which he attended, and it is not proved that he did not do so. But I think he was entitled to rely upon the judgment, information, and advice of the chairman and general manager, as to whose integrity, skill, and competence he had no reason for suspicion. I agree with what was said by Sir George Jessel in Hallmark's Case [(1878) 9 Ch D 329] , and by Chitty J. in In re Denham &amp; Co. [(1883) 25 Ch D 752] , that directors are not bound to examine entries in the company's books. It was the duty of the general manager and (possibly) of the chairman to go carefully through the returns from the branches, and to bring before the board any matter requiring their consideration; but the respondent was not, in my opinion, guilty of negligence in not examining them for himself, notwithstanding that they were laid on the table of the board for reference. ... 
In other circumstances it has been said that a " chairman has the primary responsibility of selecting matters and documents to be brought to the board's attention ": AWA Ltd v Daniels (1992) 7 ACSR 759 at 867. More recently, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2003] NSWSC 85 at [51] [72], 174 FLR 128 at 141 7, Austin J has reviewed the authorities and considered the duties owed by a chairman of a listed company.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1998/563.html</AustLII>
<text>99 Had the entirety of the proceeding been concluded in July 2008 by the discontinuance by the Applicants of their claim for relief, it may well have been that an order for costs, or some part of the costs that had been incurred, would have been made in favour of Mr Rickus. In Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J, for example, referred with approval to the following observations of Cooper J in Grundy v Lewis [1998] FCA 563: 
 Although the power to award costs is unfettered, there is in the Federal Court Rules an underlying policy that a party who discontinues proceedings is to be held liable for the costs of the other parties ... unless the court otherwise orders (see for example O 22 r 3, O 62 r 26). 
This " underlying policy ", according to Her Honour, had not " hardened into a usual rule ": [2005] FCA 997 at [44] . But the " underlying policy " may well have indicated that Mr Rickus may have obtained a favourable costs order. Whether or not he was exposed to a duty or obligation to produce to the Trustee the documents or a copy of the documents he had been required to produce to the Authority, would have been an issue not requiring resolution.</text>

<text>98 Contrary to the submission of Mr Rickus, there is no " general rule " that a party who discontinues a proceeding with the leave of the Court pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules should normally pay the costs occasioned by the discontinuance.

<tocase>Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828 , 169 FCR 483</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/828.html</AustLII>
<text>13 A related proceeding was also commenced by the Trustee. The Respondents to that proceeding were the Authority and Mr Rickus. In that proceeding, judicial review was sought of the Authority's decision to refuse to return the documents produced by Mr Rickus to the Trustee. That application was dismissed: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828 , 169 FCR 483.

14 Leave was given to the Applicants on 28 July 2008 for the discontinuance of the present proceeding. The question of costs was reserved.

15 Now before the Court are two issues, namely: 
 
(i) the resolution of the Cross-Claim filed by the First Respondent; and 
 
(ii) the order as to costs arising out of the discontinuance of the proceeding.

56 One difficulty was that the Authority sought an opportunity to itself make submissions. The Authority had previously been joined as the Second Respondent, in November 2007. But it had taken no real part in the present proceeding thereafter. Its participation was substantially confined to the related proceeding: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828. The Authority's renewed interest in the present proceeding occurred during the course of submissions in reply being advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus. The Authority, it was said, had an interest in being heard as to whether a person upon whom a notice had been served under s 255 of the 1993 Act thereafter came under a duty such as that now sought to be espoused by the Trustee. Notwithstanding the lateness of its expressed interest, the opportunity for the Authority to file written submissions confined to that issue was not opposed by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Trustee. Directions were made for the filing of written submissions and for submissions in reply by both Mr Rickus and the Trustee.

57 Any contention that, by seeking leave to discontinue its claims as against Mr Rickus, the Trustee was thereby precluded from resisting the Cross-Claim is to be rejected. The abandonment of a claim pursued as an applicant is not considered to be the abandonment of any defence that an applicant may otherwise have to a cross-claim. By seeking leave to discontinue, the Trustee was simply contending that it no longer wished to pursue its own claim for relief -- for whatever reason. The Trustee's decision to seek leave to discontinue the Application in July 2008 may well have been influenced by the fact that it had already obtained copies of most of the documents previously produced to the Authority by Mr Rickus, or by the stage reached in relation to the inquiries being pursued by the Authority. But, whatever the reason which motivated the Trustee, leave was given to discontinue. It thereafter remained a matter for Mr Rickus to decide whether he wished to pursue his Cross-Claim or whether he too would seek to discontinue that action. If the Cross-Claim was to be pursued, the Cross Respondent was entitled to rely upon whatever issues had been legitimately raised in the Defence as filed. A discontinuance of an application is not to be construed in some way as some implied amendment of a defence as filed to a cross-claim.

58 But it was the further contention of Mr Rickus as to prejudice that had the potential to occasion greater procedural difficulty. It was his contention that, had the source of the duty been more fully articulated at the outset of the hearing of the Cross-Claim , there would have been cross-examination of a number of witnesses in order to establish facts that were not otherwise considered to be relevant. A number of such outstanding facts were immediately articulated by Senior Counsel during the course of oral submissions. None of those facts then expressed were seen by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Trustee to be contentious and such as could not be the subject of agreement. A short adjournment was thus granted to enable Senior Counsel for Mr Rickus to more fully consider his position and to determine whether additional facts were also considered to be necessary. That short adjournment, however, provided insufficient time in which to properly consider the matter and the proceeding was adjourned to the following morning.

84 The other basis relied upon by the Trustee was that the documents provided by Mr Rickus were the property of the Trustee. As previously observed, it was not previously considered that an assertion as to property had been made out by the Trustee: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828 at [45] , [2008] FCA 828 ; 169 FCR 483 at 494. No reason has been advanced during the course of the present hearing to reach any contrary conclusion.

85 A further submission advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus was that s 299 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act renders him " immune " from liability, " including an obligation of disclosure ". Although this provision received scant attention during the course of oral submissions, and was not adverted to at all in the Reply to the Defence to the Cross-Claim , it was a provision to which reference was made in written submissions and leave was sought (if necessary) to amend to enable reliance to be placed upon it.

86 It is also an argument which can be shortly dealt with.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2007/81.html</AustLII>
<text>36 The " Liability " to accede to the demand of the Trustee is considered to be a " Liability " incurred at a time when Mr Rickus was " holding office as ... an officer of " the Trustee. In National Roads and Motorists' Assoc v Whitlam [2007] NSWCA 81 , 25 ACLC 688 Campbell JA observed in respect of a like provision:
 [78] The expression "as an officer" has in the present context the shade of meaning of "while acting in the role of an officer". If an officer is sued for a liability he or she is alleged to owe by reason of his or her actions in the role of an officer, it is within the scope of the indemnity. It is because any such liability is within the scope of the indemnity that reasonable costs incurred in defending any such assertion of liability are themselves also within the scope of the indemnity. 
Beazley JA and Handley AJA there agreed with Campbell JA. Special leave to appeal was refused: Whitlam v National Roads and Motorists Assoc Ltd [2007] HCATrans 484. The fact that Mr Rickus thereafter ceased to occupy that office is not considered to be a reason to reach any contrary conclusion.</text>

<text>42 By virtue of s 140(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) a company's constitution has effect as a contract between the company and each director of the company. See: New Cap Reinsurance Corp Ltd v Daya [2008] NSWSC 64 at [20] , 216 FLR 126 at 130 per Barrett J.

43 Relevantly, cl 88 provides as follows:
 Officers: Indemnities and Insurance 88. (1) In this Article:- (a) "Legal Costs" of a person means legal costs incurred by that person in defending an action for Liability of that person. (b) "Liability" of a person means any liability incurred by that person as an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company. (c) "Relevant Officer" means a person who is, or has been, a Director or Secretary. (2) To the extent permitted by law, the Company must indemnify each Relevant Officer against:- (a) a Liability of that person; and (b) Legal Costs of that person. (3) To the extent permitted by law, the Company may make a payment (whether by way of advance, loan or otherwise) to a Relevant Officer in respect of Legal Costs of that person. (4) To the extent permitted by law, the Company may pay, or agree to pay, a premium for a contract insuring a Relevant Officer against:- (a) a Liability of that person; and (b) Legal Costs of that person. (5) To the extent permitted by law, the Company may enter into an agreement or deed with:- (a) a Relevant Officer; or (b) a person who is, or has been, an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, under which the Company must do all or any of the following:- ... (d) indemnify that person against any Liability of that person; (e) make a payment (whether by way of advance, loan or otherwise) to that person in respect of Legal Costs of that person... ... 
 
 
 
 
 

 Section 9 of the Corporations Act relevantly defines an " officer " as including a director.

44 The advantage to Mr Rickus should cl 88, and in particular cl 88(2), be an independent source of the indemnity sought to be invoked is that the indemnity thereby conferred would be free of the textual constraints imposed by cl 2.2 of the Deed . Clause 88(4), upon which some reliance was placed, does not assist. It is simply a provision which permits the payment of a premium.</text>

Reference may also be made to one of the authorities there referred to by His Honour, namely Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71. Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed (at 113):
 In this country, fiduciary obligations arise because a person has come under an obligation to act in another's interests. As a result, equity imposes on the fiduciary proscriptive obligations -- not to obtain any unauthorised benefit from the relationship and not to be in a position of conflict. If these obligations are breached, the fiduciary must account for any profits and make good any losses arising from the breach. But the law of this country does not otherwise impose positive legal duties on the fiduciary to act in the interests of the person to whom the duty is owed. If there was a general fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the patient, it would necessarily follow that a doctor has a duty to inform the patient that he or she has breached their contract or has been guilty of negligence in dealings with the patient. That is not the law of this country. 
Gummow J concluded (at 137 8):
 Fiduciary obligations arise (albeit perhaps not exclusively) in various situations where it may be seen that one person is under an obligation to act in the interests of another. Equitable remedies are available where the fiduciary places interest in conflict with duty or derives an unauthorised profit from abuse of duty. It would be to stand established principle on its head to reason that because equity considers the defendant to be a fiduciary, therefore the defendant has a legal obligation to act in the interests of the plaintiff so that failure to fulfil that positive obligation represents a breach of fiduciary duty.

<text>98 Contrary to the submission of Mr Rickus, there is no " general rule " that a party who discontinues a proceeding with the leave of the Court pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules should normally pay the costs occasioned by the discontinuance.

99 Had the entirety of the proceeding been concluded in July 2008 by the discontinuance by the Applicants of their claim for relief, it may well have been that an order for costs, or some part of the costs that had been incurred, would have been made in favour of Mr Rickus. In Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J, for example, referred with approval to the following observations of Cooper J in Grundy v Lewis [1998] FCA 563: 
 Although the power to award costs is unfettered, there is in the Federal Court Rules an underlying policy that a party who discontinues proceedings is to be held liable for the costs of the other parties ... unless the court otherwise orders (see for example O 22 r 3, O 62 r 26). 
This " underlying policy ", according to Her Honour, had not " hardened into a usual rule ": [2005] FCA 997 at [44] . But the " underlying policy " may well have indicated that Mr Rickus may have obtained a favourable costs order. Whether or not he was exposed to a duty or obligation to produce to the Trustee the documents or a copy of the documents he had been required to produce to the Authority, would have been an issue not requiring resolution.</text>

<text>37 In resisting the claim for production of the documents, it is further considered that at the time the demand was first made for the production of those documents, and whilst Mr Rickus remained a director, he was acting bona fide and in a manner which he reasonably considered was in the best interests of the Trustee. It was the genuineness of his belief which enabled his conduct to remain properly characterised as " acting in the capacity of an officer ". A director may be opposed to the views of his company but still act in the due performance of his office: Talbot v NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 887 , 50 NSWLR 300. Hodgson CJ in Eq there observed:
 [24] In my opinion it is clear that it is insufficient that the director honestly believes that this action is required: the director must also be acting reasonably. That is the position in relation to trustees: Re Knox's Trust [1895] 2 Ch 483; McGregor v McGregor (No 2) [1919] NZLR 286. [25] In my opinion, in cases like these, before taking the extreme step of bringing legal proceedings against the company, a director must take into account not only the director's own view of what is in the company's interests, but also the views of others; and in that regard the director should not be too ready to attribute dishonesty or unreasonableness to other persons, and the director should take into account his or her own fallibility. The director should also take into account all the consequences of bringing proceedings against the company, including the consequences of the court decision going either way, and the costs of litigation. However, if, having done all these things, the director believes that it would be in the interests of the company that the company be subject to litigation, and that he or she would be in breach of his or her own duties as a director if the proceedings were not taken, and if those beliefs are both honest and reasonable, then it seems to me that the bringing of the proceedings should be regarded as due performance of the director's office, so that the director would be entitled to expenses and an indemnity from the company.

38 If this construction of cl 2.2 is not correct, it would be open to the Trustee to make the demand upon Mr Rickus by reason of him occupying the position of director and thereafter deny him the benefit of the indemnity by simply removing him from his position. In resisting the demand for the return of the documents, it is thus concluded that Mr Rickus was acting bona fide and that the legal costs he incurred were costs " incurred in respect of " that " Liability ".

39 Also rejected is an argument advanced by the Trustee that there was a failure on the part of Mr Rickus to give such notice as is required by cl 2.5. Notice of an intention to invoke the right to indemnity was provided by way of an exchange of correspondence from the solicitors acting for Mr Rickus to the solicitors acting for the Trustee, first by way of a letter dated 16 May 2007, and again by way of a letter dated 3 October 2007.</text>

<text>36 The " Liability " to accede to the demand of the Trustee is considered to be a " Liability " incurred at a time when Mr Rickus was " holding office as ... an officer of " the Trustee. In National Roads and Motorists' Assoc v Whitlam [2007] NSWCA 81 , 25 ACLC 688 Campbell JA observed in respect of a like provision:
 [78] The expression "as an officer" has in the present context the shade of meaning of "while acting in the role of an officer". If an officer is sued for a liability he or she is alleged to owe by reason of his or her actions in the role of an officer, it is within the scope of the indemnity. It is because any such liability is within the scope of the indemnity that reasonable costs incurred in defending any such assertion of liability are themselves also within the scope of the indemnity. 
Beazley JA and Handley AJA there agreed with Campbell JA. Special leave to appeal was refused: Whitlam v National Roads and Motorists Assoc Ltd [2007] HCATrans 484. The fact that Mr Rickus thereafter ceased to occupy that office is not considered to be a reason to reach any contrary conclusion.</text>

<text>17 For the purposes of resolving the Cross-Claim , it may be accepted that indemnities protecting directors against liabilities incurred whilst performing their duties, including indemnities protecting directors of public companies, are of importance in ensuring that highly qualified and experienced people are attracted to assume the responsibility: cf Whitlam v National Roads and Motorists' Assoc Ltd [2006] NSWSC 766 at [82] , 202 FLR 153 at 176 per Bergin J. Noted: 'Young P W, Corporations: Director's Indemnity Rights ' (2006) 80 ALJ 720.

18 The source of the right to claim an indemnity being advanced by the First Respondent may be traced back to the Constitution of the Trustee.

19 That Constitution provides in cl 88(5) that " the Company may enter into an agreement or deed " to indemnify an officer of the company.

63 Section 199A of the Corporations Act provides as follows:
 Indemnification and exemption of officer or auditor Exemptions not allowed (1) A company or a related body corporate must not exempt a person (whether directly or through an interposed entity) from a liability to the company incurred as an officer or auditor of the company. When indemnity for liability (other than for legal costs) not allowed (2) A company or a related body corporate must not indemnify a person (whether by agreement or by making a payment and whether directly or through an interposed entity) against any of the following liabilities incurred as an officer or auditor of the company: (a) a liability owed to the company or a related body corporate; (b) a liability for a pecuniary penalty order under section 1317G or a compensation order under section 1317H or 1317HA ; (c) a liability that is owed to someone other than the company or a related body corporate and did not arise out of conduct in good faith. This subsection does not apply to a liability for legal costs. When indemnity for legal costs not allowed (3) A company or related body corporate must not indemnify a person (whether by agreement or by making a payment and whether directly or through an interposed entity) against legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred as an officer or auditor of the company if the costs are incurred: (a) in defending or resisting proceedings in which the person is found to have a liability for which they could not be indemnified under subsection (2); or (b) in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the person is found guilty; or (c) in defending or resisting proceedings brought by ASIC or a liquidator for a court order if the grounds for making the order are found by the court to have been established; or (d) in connection with proceedings for relief to the person under this Act in which the Court denies the relief. Paragraph (c) does not apply to costs incurred in responding to actions taken by ASIC or a liquidator as part of an investigation before commencing proceedings for the court order. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the outcome of proceedings is the outcome of the proceedings and any appeal in relation to the proceedings. 
This section is effective as from 1 July 2005. The evolution of s 199A , it may be noted, has been helpfully traced by Her Honour Justice Bergin in Whitlam v National Roads and Motorists' Association Ltd [2006] NSWSC 766 at [40] [56], 202 FLR 153 at 165 71.

64 In the absence of any constraint sought to be imposed upon Mr Rickus by the Authority in respect to the disclosure to the Trustee of those documents embraced by the s 255 notice, the contention advanced on behalf of the Trustee was that it was incumbent upon Mr Rickus to make available to the Trustee copies of those documents provided by Mr Rickus to the regulator -- at least upon a request being made. It was contended that a duty to act in the best interests of the company was a duty which embraced the obligation to keep the Trustee informed as to those matters which may be of relevance to the position of the regulator. In the absence of any statutorily imposed obligation of confidence, or perhaps an obligation of confidence sought by the regulator by agreement, the contention of the Trustee was that Mr Rickus was to keep the board fully informed as to those matters which had been placed before the regulator so that the board could properly respond to such concerns as may be raised by the regulator and even modify its own practices -- even in the absence of any concern being raised by the regulator.

65 Indeed, in the absence of further explanation, it would seem surprising if a director was not obliged to bring to the attention of his board a request (for example) made of him by the present Authority to produce documents of immediate relevance to the affairs of his company; a request made of him by the Commissioner of Taxation for access to books pursuant to s 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth); or a request made of him by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission pursuant to s 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for the production of documents. An exercise of such statutory powers may be the precursor to a regulator imposing upon a company a variety of sanctions perceived by the regulator to be warranted. A company may wish to challenge the validity of a statutory demand made upon one of its directors. Even if no challenge is to be made, a company may wish to consider whether any further documents should also be provided to a regulator to assist it in the discharge of its responsibilities or to make submissions in respect to that material already in the possession of a regulator. In the absence of knowing the terms of any notice requiring the production of documents and having a copy of documents produced, it is difficult to see how a company could properly address such concerns as a regulator may have.</text>

<text>52 The very existence of any such duty and -- if any such duty existed -- the content of the duty had thus to be addressed as a matter of general principle. As a matter of general principle it was common ground that:
 
(a) the duty owed by a director to his company is fiduciary in character (eg, Australian Growth Resources Corp Pty Ltd v Van Reesema (1988) 13 ACLR 261 at 268 per King CJ); 
 
(b) the duty includes a duty to act bona fide and in the best interests of the company (eg, Darvall v North Sydney Brick &amp; Tile Co Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 260 at 270 per Kirby P; Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671);
 
(c) the discharge of that duty may involve a right on the part of a director to inspect those documents relevant to the discharge of the duty (eg, Edman v Ross (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 351 ; Molomby v Whitehead [1985] FCA 421 ; (1985) 7 FCR 541 at 550 per Beaumont J);
 
(d) the discharge of the duty involves a director becoming familiar with how the company conducts its business (eg, Daniels v Anderson (1995) 37 NSWLR 438 at 500 1); and 
 
(e) a director who occupies the position of chairman may have additional rights and duties, including a duty of selecting documents to be placed before the board for its consideration and keeping the board fully informed (cf Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 at 225 per Mahoney JA). 
 
Reference should also be made to ss 180 to 184 of the Corporations Act and to Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [8-010] and [8-065] [8-090] (13 th ed, 2007). The statutory duties imposed by ss 181 and 182 reflect, and to some extent refine, corresponding obligations on directors under the general law: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell [2006] NSWSC 1052 at [99] , [2006] NSWSC 1052 ; 59 ACSR 373 at 397. See also: Austin R, Ford H and Ramsay I, Company Directors: Principles of Law and Corporate Governance (2005) at [7.4]. Beyond recognition of these general principles, the potential existed in the present proceeding for submissions to descend to a level of unnecessary abstraction.</text>
