<tocase>TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1067</tocase>
<text>13 The respondent contends that the applicant may only appeal on a question of law and the subject matter of the appeal can only be the question of law so raised ( TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1067 at 1069 1070 per Gummow J; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; 149 FCR 522 at 527 per Branson J, with Spender and Nicholson JJ agreeing); a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the AAT Act; and a broad inquiry as to the construction and operation of a statutory provision is not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the AAT Act ( Comcare v Etheridge (supra) at p 528 [19]). The respondent notes that in Comcare v Etheridge , Branson J at p 528 observed that 'by inviting the Court to engage in such a broad and hypothetical inquiry the purported question of law extends beyond any controversy between the parties' and is thus incapable of constituting 'a matter' within the competence of the Court's jurisdiction. The respondent says that each of the questions raised by the applicant and the contended errors identified are not errors of law and simply invite the Court to consider factual questions and engage in a broad inquiry as to the construction of particular statutory provisions.

32 However, the injury resulted in impairment that was 'likely to continue indefinitely' (see the definition of permanent in s 4(1) of the SRC Act). That state of 'likelihood' was satisfied because Mr Parker's right eye was found to be dead, shrunken and potentially in need of removal [11]. However, for the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent, s 24(2) requires these matters to be considered:
 
 (a) the duration of the impairment; 
 
 (b) the likelihood of improvement in the employee's condition; 
 
 
 
 (c) whether the employee has undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment; and 
 
 
 
 (d) any other relevant matters.

33 Accordingly, having regard to the findings of the Tribunal, Mr Parker suffered impairment, namely, the loss of use of his right eye; that loss will endure for the rest of his life; it cannot improve as the eye is, in every relevant sense, dead; and the analysis of the problem has been the subject of extensive medical consultation and review. Mr Parker's impairment is thus a permanent impairment.

34 Subject to Part II of the SRC Act, s 14(1) which forms part of Division 1 of Part II (Part II Compensation; Division 1 Injuries, property loss or damage, medical expenses) provides for a liability in the respondent to pay compensation in respect of an injury resulting in impairment . Section 24(1) of the Part II specifically addresses a liability to pay compensation in respect of an injury where that injury results in a permanent impairment . An injury contemplated by s 6A(2)(b) suffered by a person to which s 6A applies, is an injury for the purposes of s 24(1) if such an injury results in a permanent impairment. A liability arises in the respondent to pay compensation to Mr Parker in respect of that injury .</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Houghton [2003] FCA 332</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/332.html</AustLII>
<text>30 The Tribunal concluded that Mr Parker suffered an injury as that term is understood for the purposes of s 6A(2) of the SRC Act ( Comcare v Houghton [2003] FCA 332 per Lindgren J [20]) as an unintended consequence of medical treatment paid for by the Commonwealth (s 6A(2)(a) and (b)). Thus, Mr Parker suffered, as a statutory construct, an injury arising out of or in the course of his employment.

31 That injury resulted in impairment as the injury to Mr Parker's right eye resulted in the 'loss of the use or the damage or malfunction of [a] part of the body' of Mr Parker (see the definition of impairment in s 4(1) of the SRC Act) and thus a liability arose to pay compensation to Mr Parker in respect of that injury (s 14(1) of the SRC Act).</text>

<tocase>Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; 80 ALJR 1578</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/47.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; 80 ALJR 1578, their Honours, Gummow ACJ, Kirby, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ at p 1580 [6] described the structure of s 24 of the SRC Act in these terms:
 
 Section 24(1) is the general provision imposing liability upon Comcare to pay compensation where an injury results in a permanent impairment. However, s 24(4) renders s 24(5) the central provision. Section 24(5) requires Comcare to determine 'the degree of permanent impairment of the employee'; this is to be expressed as a percentage (s 24(6)). The compensation payable under s 24(1) is the equivalent percentage of the 'maximum amount' (s 24(3), (4), (9)), subject to the threshold in s 24(7). The content of the phrase the 'degree of permanent impairment of the employee' is not specifically stated in the Act; that is left to the 'approved Guide' (s 24(5)).

38 Section 24(5) directs the respondent to determine the 'degree of permanent impairment of the employee' resulting from an injury, under the provisions of the approved Guide. The 'key statutory criterion of the occurrence of "an injury"' resulting in a permanent impairment has been fulfilled as found by the Tribunal. Section 24(5) requires the respondent to approach the 'criteria and methodologies set out in the Guide' through the 'prism' of an injury and assess the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker 'resulting from that injury ' ( Canute v Comcare (supra) [14]). In that sense, the terms of s 24(5) are 'quite clear'. ( Canute v Comcare (supra) [14]).

39 Accordingly, s 24(5) requires the respondent to determine the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker resulting from an injury, 'under the provisions of the approved Guide'. Prima facie , the Guide as a subordinate instrument cannot alter the burden of the clear statutory inquiry and determination required by s 24(5) by adding a qualification to the question or matter to be determined. For example, the question is not 'what degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker has resulted from the injury suffered by Mr Parker having regard to whether, had the injury not occurred, Mr Parker would have suffered permanent impairment or the same degree of permanent impairment as a result of other causes (including the progression of an underlying pre-existing condition )'. Since the key criterion of an injury resulting in permanent impairment has been fulfilled, the only inquiry required by s 24(5) is a determination of the degree of permanent impairment of Mr Parker resulting from the injury . That determination requires an acceptance of the 'fulfilled' nexus between the injury and permanent impairment and directs reference to the provisions of the approved Guide for the purpose of calculating the degree of permanent impairment of the individual in order to give voice to the percentage and thus the amount of compensation to be paid having regard to s 24(3) and s 24(4).

40 Section 28 provides that Comcare may from time to time prepare a written document to be called the Guide under the title previously mentioned [12]. Section 28(1) requires the Guide to set out:
 
 
 (a) criteria by reference to which the degree of permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury shall be determined; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) criteria by reference to which the degree of non-economic loss suffered by an employee as a result of an injury or impairment shall be determined; and 
 
 (c) methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non-economic loss, as determined under those criteria, shall be expressed as a percentage.</text>
