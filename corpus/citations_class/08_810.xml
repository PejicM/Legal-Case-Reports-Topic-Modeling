<tocase>Allen v Tobias (1958) 98 CLR 36</tocase>
<text>Allphones suggested that the benefit received by Mr Hoy may have been greater than he claimed. It pointed to the fact that Mr Hoy had destroyed the handwritten receipt books containing the records from which his profit could be calculated. Where a person deliberately destroys a document that, depending upon which its contents may have been, would have told strongly either for or against the person, the strongest possible assumption arises that if it had been produced, the document would have told against the person. This is so even if there was no intention to destroy evidence. The principle is that the person is in the position that they would have been in without the corroboration which might otherwise have been expected: Allen v Tobias [1958] HCA 13 ; (1958) 98 CLR 367 at 375 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Williams JJ, applying The Ophelia [1916] 2 AC 206 at 229-230.</text>

<text>I am satisfied that Allphones was responsible for the diversion of calls from Hoy Mobile's territory of Eastgardens because of, first, the inappropriate programming by Zintel from March 2006 and, secondly, from October 2006 its own failure to correct what it knew was a problem. I am satisfied that Hoy Mobile lost the opportunity to make some sales from calls to the 138000 number during the period of the diversion. I am also satisfied that this loss had some value. Where there has been an actual loss of some sort, the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money to defeat an award of damages: see Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4 ; (1992) 179 CLR 332 at 349-350 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. However, it is not possible to make any precise calculation of the value of this loss, which included payments under cll 7.3 and 7.4 and the ongoing right to receive MTAC. Doing the best I can, I find the value of this to be the loss of about 1% of the sales of the Randwick store made during the period of the diversion. That results in a past loss of about $900, but this amount excludes any MTAC which Hoy Mobile would have earned after March 2007 on those sales. Although there is some guesswork involved, I find the total loss of Hoy Mobile as a result of the diversion to be $1,500: see generally Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [37] - [38] per Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Kirby JJ agreed: Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at 569-570 [35] - [36] per Black CJ and Jacobson J, at 581 [99]-[101] per myself.</text>

<text>The process of construction is intended elucidate and give effect to what the parties by their words or actions objectively conveyed to one another was their agreement. Courts seek to avoid being the destroyers of bargains and should be reluctant to find agreements void for uncertainty. The process of construction will result in a meaning which the court decides is the proper construction of the contract. As Barwick CJ emphasised in Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437, in the search for the parties' intention, no narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial agreements. Unless parties have expressed themselves in such a way that their terms are so obscure or incapable of any definite or precise meaning so that the Court cannot attribute to them any particular contractual intention, the Court will find a meaning which an objective person in the position of the parties at the time they entered into the contract would have understood them to have intended: see also Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2000] HCA 25 ; (2000) 202 CLR 588 at 599 [15] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia ( CEPU ) v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 510 [164] - [166] , 511 [171], 512 [174] per Weinberg and Bennett JJ and myself.</text>

<text>For all that, Hoy Mobile was overcharged and underpaid by Allphones. While Hoy Mobile could talk or send letters, it received an insouciant reception from Allphones. Whatever they 'batted back' was not scoring runs. And Allphones persisted throughout the litigation to force Hoy Mobile to prove its monetary claims. As I have found, Allphones not only evinced an intention to not to be bound, it acted in that way. Hoy Mobile could complain as much as it liked, but Allphones had the substantive power in the relationship and used it. This was evident not just in its financial breaches, but, as Mr Harkin said in his May 2006 meeting with Mr Hoy, (before his fraud had come to light) he was going to make an example of Hoy Mobile to show other franchisees what would happen to them if they opposed Allphones as the Hoys had. No justification existed, at that time, to treat Hoy Mobile in accordance with 'the Admiral Byng principle', viz: 'pour encourager les autres' (in order to encourage others): see Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd [1987] UKHL 13 ; [1987] 1 WLR 1248 per Lord Oliver Aylmerton at 1317; Attorney-General (UK) v Heinemann Publishers Australia Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 45 ; (1987) 75 ALR 461 at 464 per Deane J. Nor was Allphones able to advance any legitimate reason for refusing to credit Hoy Mobile with the $1,100 which Optus had allocated to defray the cost of the store refresh. I am satisfied that Allphones was acting vindictively in refusing to give Hoy Mobile that credit. I have found that Allphones had not proved that it was entitled to make the $10,000 charge (as opposed to a reasonable charge) but its conduct in relation to the Optus payment indicated that Allphones considered that it could make a profit at Hoy Mobile's expense without justification. 33.1 Principles</text>

I am of opinion that the genesis of the franchise agreement, the background context and market in which the parties were operating were all relevant, as known to both of them, for the purpose of construing what was intended to be referred to by the use of 'N/A' in describing the territory. There is no evidence that the terms of the franchise agreement as settled between the parties was the subject of drafting, before execution, by lawyers.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; (2007) 237 ALR 512</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/38.html</AustLII>
<text>Allphones argued that I should follow the Court of Appeal's decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 on the construction of Commonwealth legislation in accordance with the principles in Farah 230 CLR at 151-152 [135]. However, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal's decision should not be followed for three reasons: First, that decision was on a different legislation, namely an earlier version of the Code that was not in force at the time when Hoy Mobile and Allphones entered into the franchise agreement. The subsequent decision of the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; (2007) 237 ALR 512 demonstrates that the approach to construction adopted by the Court of Appeal was wrong (see below). (I note that special leave to appeal from the decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was granted by Gummow and Crennan JJ: Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA Trans 89.) I am convinced that the decision of the Court of Appeal is plainly wrong.

In Baxter Health Care 237 ALR at 527-528 [44]-[48], Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ noted that there was nothing unusual about legislation providing for a circumstance in which making or giving effect to a contract involves an offence by one party to the contract, but not by the other. In that case their Honours were also construing the operation of the Trade Practices Act . They said that the consequences of such illegality for the rights of the respective parties would not necessarily be the same and, they continued ( Baxter Health Care 237 ALR at 527 [44]): 
 
 'Furthermore, there is nothing unusual about the Act applying to one party to a transaction, or proposed transaction, but not to the other. Leaving aside the extended operation given by s 6 , ss 46 and 47 according to their terms apply to conduct by corporations, not sole traders or partnerships. In a transaction between a corporation and an individual, the provisions may apply to the corporation but not to the individual. Differential application of legislation to parties to a contract is commonplace, although working out the legal consequences may be complex.'

Here the very prohibition in cl 11 of the Code is directed to the conduct of the franchisor. Clause 11 does not in its terms seek to affect adversely the position of the franchisee; rather its aim is to protect the franchisee. The Code did not prohibit a franchisee from entering into or enforcing a franchise agreement with a franchisor where cl 11 had not been observed. It would be an unusual result if beneficial legislation, intended to protect persons in the position of a franchisee, were to destroy the legal validity of a franchisee's bargain and then throw upon it the burden of having to apply to a court and take on the risk of litigation, in seeking to establish a franchise agreement against a defaulting franchisor, errant in its compliance with cl 11 of the Code. A franchisor would be entitled, as Allphones suggests here, to say that it was not bound by a franchise agreement because of its own default.

That consequence tends to suggest that non-compliance with the Code was not intended to avoid the contract, but rather to give rise to rights under the Act to have the contract varied or made void so as to remedy the consequence of a non-compliance with the Code. Indeed, the language of cl 5(1) provides that the Code applies to a franchise agreement entered into on or after 1 October 1998. That suggests validity rather than invalidity of the franchise agreement even where some provision of the Code has not been complied with. Moreover, the purpose of the Code in cl 2(1) is said to be the regulation of 'the conduct of participants in franchising towards other participants in franchising'. The clause is silent as to any intention to destroy franchisees' rights in certain circumstances. A franchisee who does not obtain statements required by cl 11 and provide them to the franchisor may nevertheless be entitled to protection or relief. Protection of the interests and rights of a franchisee in such a case is not likely to ensue from the destruction of the very agreement that the franchisee has apparently sought to enter. As Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ said in Baxter Health Care 237 ALR at 527 [46] (citing Phoenix General Insurance Co of Greece SA v Halvanon Insurance Co Ltd [1988] QB 216 ; [1987] 2 All ER 152 at 175-176 per Kerr LJ), when a statute contains a unilateral prohibition on entry into a contract, it does not follow that the contract is void. They said: 
 
 'Whether or not the statute has this effect depends upon the mischief which the statute is designed to prevent ; its language, scope and purpose; the consequences for the innocent party ; and any other relevant consideration. Ultimately, the question is one of statutory construction. As was pointed out in SST Consulting Services ([Pty Ltd v Rieson (2006)] [2006] HCA 31 ; 225 CLR 516 at 527 [30] ), the Act is far from being silent on the question of the consequences of illegality, but, rather, contains elaborate provisions. That is not to say that the express provisions of the Act answer all questions that may arise, but they answer many of them, and set the context in which others are to be resolved.' (emphasis added)

I am of opinion that the Code does not evince a legislative policy of striking down every franchise agreement entered into by a franchisor who fails to comply with any provision in cl 11. To the contrary, I am of opinion that the intention of the Code is to place an obligation on a franchisor by setting a norm of conduct with which it is to comply. Failure to comply with that norm of conduct gives the franchisee rights to rely upon that failure in order to seek the setting aside of the agreement, if that relief is appropriate, and also to seek relief because of the unconscionable conduct such non-compliance by the franchisor may evidence: see ss 51AC(3)(g) and (4)(g) of the Trade Practices Act . But I am satisfied that it cannot have been the purpose of the Code to make void a franchise agreement for any failure, especially one by the franchisor, to comply with cl 11, however trivial, without any consideration of the franchisee's position.

The starting point for the enquiry as to the effect of the Code, as identified by the passage I have emphasised in Baxter Health Care 237 ALR at 527 [46], was not addressed by Mason P because he said there was no need to seek guidance from implications in the legislative framework. That enquiry includes the mischief which the statute is designed to prevent and the consequences for the innocent party. Here cl 6A of the Codes elucidates the purposes of the disclosure document. And cl 11(2) shows that a purpose of the requirement for the written statements is to provide the franchisee, at the very least, with the opportunity to be informed by appropriate independent advice, if he or she wishes to obtain it. Importantly, cl 11(2)(b)(ii) makes it plain that the franchisee can choose not to seek such advice. In such a case, the mere oversight to obtain a signed statement that the franchisee had been told that he or she could seek advice but had chosen not to, when he or she had told the franchisor of that decision, could not have been intended to avoid a franchise agreement. No protective purpose would be achieved by such pedantry and much commercial inconvenience could result.

In my respectful opinion, although his Honour did not have the benefit of the reasoning in Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; 237 ALR 512 , which was delivered subsequently to the reasons in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 , the reasoning of Mason P is plainly wrong. In addition, Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was decided on different legislation: see McNamara 221 CLR at 661 [40]; Walker Corporation 242 ALR at 391 [31]. I am of opinion that the non-compliance by Allphones with its obligations under cl 11 of the Code did not make the franchise agreement void. That non-compliance is a factor which, had Hoy Mobile wished to do so, could have been raised by it to seek relief under s 87 of the Act. It would defeat the evident purpose of the Code if Allphones were entitled to rely on its own breach of its obligation imposed under cl 11 to deny a franchisee with whom it had entered into a contract, the entitlement to enforce that contract against it or to seek a variation of it or relief from it under the Act. For these reasons I reject Allphones' argument that the franchise agreement is void.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead (Franchising) Pty Ltd (2000) 104 FCR 25</tocase>
<text>On 22 May 2006, Mr Birch wrote to Mr Donnellan. The letter stated that there was a signed contract between Allphones and Hoy Mobile dated 27 June 2003. Mr Birch pointed out that there had been no agreement to any modification, alteration or amendment of that contract, and that Hoy Mobile was not prepared to sign the amended version which had been sent by Allphones. He said that Mr Harkin's assertion at the quarterly review meeting that there was no contract was incorrect. Mr Birch then asserted that the franchise agreement needed rectification because of the entry 'N/A' after the word 'territory'. He pointed out Allphones' contraventions of cl 11 of the Code, prior to entering into the franchise agreement. He said that the territory represented and warranted by Allphones was an exclusive territory with a radius of 5km from the location of the business premises. The letter asserted that the opening of the Randwick store within the radius of 5 km from the Eastgardens store was a breach of Hoy Mobile's exclusive territory. He complained about the 'bullying' style adopted by Mr Harkin and Mr Donnellan in dealing with Hoy Mobile, and referred to the decision of Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead (Franchising) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at 268 [43] .

On the next day Mr Donnellan wrote an email back to Mr Birch with a copy to Mrs Hoy saying that he had just read Mr Birch's letter and that it was '[p]riceless stuff'. He said that if Hoy Mobile was in breach of the agreement and did not remedy, it would be terminated like any other franchisee and that he did not care who was told. He said that Mr Harkin would respond and that Allphones was 'ready'. No other response was ever made by Allphones to Mr Birch's letter. Nor did Mr Donnelan identify any breach of the franchise agreement that he then alleged against Hoy Mobile.

Until this time, (late May 2006) Allphones had no knowledge that Mr Hoy had been committing a fraud over the previous two years. I will now deal with how the fraud arose and Mr Hoy's assertions that Allphones had condoned it before returning to the narrative of events. 15.1 Conversations with Mr Clarke

Allphones was not willing to carry out the franchise agreement honestly or in good faith according to its terms. Both parties have been in default of their obligations, both contractual and moral, towards one another in the conduct of the relationship. I have had regard to all of the circumstances, including Allphones' conduct leading up to the notice of intention to terminate, and the consequences on Hoy Mobile of a termination. I am of the opinion that it would be unconscientious for Allphones to insist upon its strict legal rights to force an immediate termination in all the circumstances where the performance of its own obligations under the franchise agreement has been lamentably and dishonestly short of the standards that it ought to have followed. It engaged in unjustified bullying and oppressive conduct: cf Simply No-Knead 104 FCR at 270 [51].

I am of opinion that Allphones should be restrained under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act from relying on the fraud of Hoy Mobile effect a termination of the franchise agreement.

The appropriate course is to require the parties to agree upon orders to give effect to these reasons. The orders should also provide for the amount of the damages to be awarded for the breaches of contract that I have found, less the amount of profit that I have found Hoy Mobile to have retained. Interest will need to be added. The interest on Hoy Mobile's receipts from its fraudulent trading should offset some of that due by Allphones. It may not be possible to be mathematically exact, and the parties may need to adopt a practical position of halving each year's interest in respect of the new amount for that year to approximate its progressive accrual over that period. And the parties will need to address the question of costs.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/226.html</AustLII>
<text>In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v National Exchange Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 226 ; (2005) 148 FCR 132 at 140 [30] Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ said that s 51AC , and its analogue s 12CC of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act (ASIC) 2001 (Cth), were not to be read down by limiting its operation only to circumstances where the common law would grant relief in respect of unconscionable conduct. They said that the section was intended to build on, and not be constrained by the common law. Their Honours said ( National Exchange 148 FCR at 140 [33]): '... "[U]nconscionable conduct", on its ordinary and natural interpretation, means doing what should not be done in good conscience'.

They said that the question was whether the conduct of the corporation complained of was 'unconscionable' according to the natural and ordinary meaning of that term having regard to the list of statutory considerations in ss 51AC(3) and (4): National Exchange 148 FCR at 142 [39]. And their Honours said that the section was not, of course, intended to protect the reckless or the unreasonable. They approved what Spigelman CJ had said in Attorney General (NSW) v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 at 583 [121] that '[u]nconscionability is a concept which requires a high level of moral obloquy'.

Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ held that the analogue of s 51AC required the Court to focus primarily on the unconscionable conduct of the corporation and to determine whether that conduct was contrary to the norm of conscientious behaviour. They held that the conduct in that case insisted of a carefully formulated and systematic approach which clearly offended against basic notions of good conscience and fair play: National Exchange at 148 FCR at 143 [44]. Although their Honours were speaking of s 12CC of the ASIC Act , their remarks apply equally to the notion of 'unconscionable conduct' in its analogue, s 51AC: Cannon Australia Pty Ltd v Patton [2007] NSWCA 246 at [43] per Campbell JA, with whom Harrison J agreed. Campbell JA had referred ([2007] NSWCA 246 at [40]) to the earlier decision of a Full Court of this Court in Hurley v McDonald's Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 1728 ; (2000) ATPR 41-741 at [21] - [22] . There Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ said that for conduct to be regarded at an unconscionable, serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable had to be demonstrated. They found that the term carried with it the meaning given by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, namely '... actions showing no regard for conscience, or that are irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable', relying on Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron [1996] FCA 1483 ; (1996) 66 FCR 246 at 262.

One purpose of s 51AC(1) was to set a norm of conduct for corporations acting in trade or commerce in the context in which the section operates: cp Compomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85 [103] . The second reading speech stated that this norm of conduct had the purpose of protecting the legal rights of small businesses and ensuring that they could confidently deal with large firms: see National Exchange 148 FCR at 143 [48], 144 [50]. Here the supply or possible supply of services to Hoy Mobile included the rights, benefits and privileges which Allphones had to provide to it under the franchise agreement. That congeries contained an entitlement to be paid all amounts of commission due in accordance with the franchise agreement, as well as other valuable rights, such as Hoy Mobile's right to assign its interest under the franchise agreement with Allphones' consent (cl 8.1).</text>

<text>There is a balance of deductions from Hoy Mobile's commissions that comes to $3,581.49, which the experts agreed related to the credit charge fees, EFTPOS fees, IT fees, or late banking fees. However, they were unable to allocate that sum among the individual categories. In my opinion, it was for Allphones to justify its deductions. Hoy Mobile has established that Allphones made substantial deductions from commission amounts it was paid without a contractual basis. Mr Nicoll could have given evidence as to any basis for reducing the unallocated balance but did not. And, in their reports neither Mr Nicoll nor the two expert accountants could allocate the sums involved. Hoy Mobile has discharged any onus on it: Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 64; [1774] EngR 2 ; 98 ER 969 at 970; Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ and see too at 233 per Brennan and Toohey JJ; R v Burdett (1820) 4 B &amp; Ald 95 at 161-162 per Abbott LCJ at 140 per Holroyd J; 106 ER 873 at 898 and 890. Since Allphones did not justify any portion of this balance as a fee payable by Hoy Mobile, the whole amount claimed by it should be paid by Allphones.. 25.5 Retention canvassing</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2007/24.html</AustLII>
<text>Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ held that the analogue of s 51AC required the Court to focus primarily on the unconscionable conduct of the corporation and to determine whether that conduct was contrary to the norm of conscientious behaviour. They held that the conduct in that case insisted of a carefully formulated and systematic approach which clearly offended against basic notions of good conscience and fair play: National Exchange at 148 FCR at 143 [44]. Although their Honours were speaking of s 12CC of the ASIC Act , their remarks apply equally to the notion of 'unconscionable conduct' in its analogue, s 51AC: Cannon Australia Pty Ltd v Patton [2007] NSWCA 246 at [43] per Campbell JA, with whom Harrison J agreed. Campbell JA had referred ([2007] NSWCA 246 at [40]) to the earlier decision of a Full Court of this Court in Hurley v McDonald's Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 1728 ; (2000) ATPR 41-741 at [21] - [22] . There Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ said that for conduct to be regarded at an unconscionable, serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable had to be demonstrated. They found that the term carried with it the meaning given by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, namely '... actions showing no regard for conscience, or that are irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable', relying on Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron [1996] FCA 1483 ; (1996) 66 FCR 246 at 262.</text>

<text>Of course, at common law the courts cannot make a contract for the parties which they did not make for themselves (cp: s 87(2) of the Trade Practices Act ). But commercial contracts '... ought to be construed fairly and liberally for the purpose of carrying out the object of the parties': Duncan v Koster; The Teutonia (1872) LR 4 PC 171 per Mellish LJ at 182, applied by Isaacs J in Cohen &amp; Co v Ockerby &amp; Co Ltd [1917] HCA 58 ; (1917) 24 CLR 288 at 300. Isaacs J went on to hold that expressions in a mercantile contract are not to be read narrowly, but as the Court would suppose two honest business people would understand the words they actually used with reference to their subject matter and the surrounding circumstances: Cohen &amp; Co 24 CLR at 300. And the Court construes a commercial contract to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience: Zhu 218 CLR at 559 [82] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ.

At common law, a party who brings an action for breach of contract must show that he is ready and willing to perform his part of the concurrent acts: Cohen &amp; Co 24 CLR at 298 per Isaacs J.

<tocase>Collins v Baltern (1767) 2 Wils 347</tocase>
<text>Wilmot LCJ's words are taken from his judgment in Collins v Baltern (1767) 2 Wils 347 at 351. They reflect a principle which still runs through the common law of identifying fault as an appropriate basis for the court exercising its power to grant or withhold relief. In Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418 at 441, Latham CJ, Williams and Fullagar JJ discussed a contractual power to avoid a contract in circumstances where the consent of a third party, there the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, had not been obtained within a particular time. They said that in that case, the event in question could be brought about by the failure on the part of either party to take certain necessary steps, or it could be brought about without default by either party. They concluded that the latter situation applied in that case, but determined that the clause made the contract not void, but voidable saying: 
 
 ' The question of who may avoid it depends on what happens. If one party has by his default brought about the happening of the event, the other party alone has the option of avoiding the contract . If the event has happened without default on either side, then either party may avoid the contract. But neither need do so, and, if one party having a right to avoid it does not clearly exercise that right the other party may enforce the contract against him.' (emphasis added) 
 

 
Their Honours applied this reasoning as an extension of the principle that no party, directly or indirectly, may take advantage of his own wrong.</text>

<tocase>Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389</tocase>
<text>In his examination in chief on this topic, Mr Donnellan said that Allphones had asked Optus to ensure that it was allowed to offer different incentives to different franchisees in order to promote performance, in the hope that the bonus payments would continue. He said that Optus had agreed to pay the $150 bonuses as per connection 'on a budget basis', meaning that Allphones had to modify its marketing, order stock and ensure that franchisees knew that they could make money over the three month period. He was not asked what the supposed conditions were for the payment of this commission to franchisees. His vague and general assertions do not fit with Mr Lim's insistence in his email of 3 May 2004 that if the payment of the $150 commission appeared on the stores' RCTIs, Allphones would expect the same money to be paid to it in full. The most natural inference to draw (as I do) from Mr Donnellan's failure to give any evidence on this aspect of the topic in chief, is that any such evidence as he might have given would have exposed facts unfavourable to Allphones' case: CEPU 162 FCR at 525 [230]; Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418E-G per Handley JA.

Hoy Mobile called no evidence of any actual lost sales. However, it is difficult to establish a precise basis for assessment of the value of the loss of a chance to earn revenue resulting from the erroneous diversion of 138000 calls to the Randwick store. Mr Hoy did not give evidence about what sales the Eastgardens store achieved from or as a result of telephone inquiries. I infer that he could give no evidence helpful to Hoy Mobile's case: Ferrcom 22 NSWLR at 418. Significantly, Allphones considered the 138000 as commercially useful in generating sales opportunities. Indeed, at the franchisee forum on 6 October 2006, where Mrs Hoy first discussed with Mr Pompeii the problems that the Eastgardens store was experiencing with the 138000 number, he said that the number was an important tool for sales generation. Mr Pompeii showed Ms Hoy a number of Zintel documents on his laptop computer. These showed that the Eastgardens store had five calls diverted to it by the 138000 number in March 2006, but only one in September that year.

Mr Hoy had said that he had noticed a drop from 10 calls per day to only one or two. While I am not satisfied that the number of calls at the Eastgardens store was as high as 10 call per day before the drop, I infer that once Allphones began publicising the 138000 number, customers began calling it rather than the individual stores' phone numbers. As that happened, the number of calls that the Eastgardens store received fell. Mr Pompeii's Zintel files recorded only the calls diverted to the Eastgardens store, not those which were generated in the suburb of Eastgardens, or the ones made directly to Hoy Mobile's phone number. And, as Mr Hoy's experience showed, even calls from Hoy Mobile's store itself were diverted to the Randwick store.

Zintel had programmed the 138000 number to divert calls from the Rose Bay, Vaucluse and Edgecliff telephone exchanges to the Eastgardens store. The areas served by those exchanges were well away from Eastgardens and, indeed, Randwick was closer to them. Only in February 2007 did Allphones advise Zintel that those areas belonged to the catchment area for the Randwick store, and then it required them to be changed urgently.</text>

<text>The process of construction is intended elucidate and give effect to what the parties by their words or actions objectively conveyed to one another was their agreement. Courts seek to avoid being the destroyers of bargains and should be reluctant to find agreements void for uncertainty. The process of construction will result in a meaning which the court decides is the proper construction of the contract. As Barwick CJ emphasised in Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437, in the search for the parties' intention, no narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial agreements. Unless parties have expressed themselves in such a way that their terms are so obscure or incapable of any definite or precise meaning so that the Court cannot attribute to them any particular contractual intention, the Court will find a meaning which an objective person in the position of the parties at the time they entered into the contract would have understood them to have intended: see also Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2000] HCA 25 ; (2000) 202 CLR 588 at 599 [15] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia ( CEPU ) v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 510 [164] - [166] , 511 [171], 512 [174] per Weinberg and Bennett JJ and myself.

<tocase>Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd (1920) 28 CLR 30</tocase>
<text>The principle of election operates to hold a party to a position it has communicated to the other party as the choice that it has made between two inconsistent rights. Communication of the choice cannot occur in a factual vacuum. The circumstances and context of the communication affect how a reasonable person in the position of the other party would understand it. A landlord accepting rent ( Matthews v Smallwood [1910] 1 Ch 777 per Parker J) or a fire insurer, exercising rights to take possession of the insured's damaged premises ( Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305 per Knox CJ, Isaacs and Starke JJ) acting unilaterally, could not say that it was acting 'without prejudice'.

Allphones also argued that cll 15 and 16 operated to prevent Hoy Mobile relying on any election, by Allphones to keep the franchise agreement on foot, which was not in writing. Because of my findings above it is not necessary to consider the application of R v Paulson [1921] 1 AC 271 at 282-283 to cll 15 and 16 on which Hoy Mobile relied. However, their Lordships indicated that the issue depends on the facts for they said, as Owen J pointed out in Owendale Pty Ltd v Anthony [1967] HCA 52 ; (1967) 117 CLR 539 at 610, that '[i]t may well be that many cases may occur to which the clause as to waiver would be applicable' before saying that, in that case, it was not: see too Owendale 117 CLR at 590 per Taylor J with whom Barwick CJ agreed on this issue at 569; per McTiernan J at 581; per Kitto J at 581-582. And, in any event, contractual provisions like cll 15 and 16 are strictly construed: Craine 28 CLR at 325-326; affirmed in Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd v Craine [1922] 2 AC 541 at 546; (1922) 31 CLR 27 ; see too Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners v Hancock [1927] HCA 26 ; (1927) 39 CLR 570 at 584 per Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J; 589 per Isaacs J; 590 per Rich J; and 594 per Starke J.</text>

<text>In Paal Wilson [1983] 1 AC at 915C-916D Lord Diplock discussed the entry of both parties to an executory contract into a 'new contract' which he styled 'the contract of abandonment'. He explained that in such a case, each party promises by words or conduct to release the other from further performances of obligations on its part which remain to be performed, including the obligation to pay damages. And in Australian law the parties to a contract can so conduct themselves that they can be seen to have mutually abandoned or abrogated the contract; for example where neither takes any steps to perform over a period: see Summers v The Commonwealth [1918] HCA 33 ; (1918) 25 CLR 144 at 151-152 per Isaacs J; DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423 at 434 per Stephen Mason and Jacobs JJ; Foran 168 CLR at 422-423 per Brennan J.

In DTR Nominees 138 CLR at 433 Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ held that for a party to be entitled to rescind for anticipatory breach, he must be at the time of rescission himself be willing to perform the contract on its proper interpretation. They said: 
 
 'Otherwise he is not an innocent party, the common description of a party entitled to rescind for anticipatory breach, and indeed could profit from his misinterpretation of the contract, as the appellant seeks to do in this case when it claims forfeiture of the deposit and damages.' 
 

 29.4 Findings regarding Allphones' entitlement to terminate

I am of opinion that a similar principle must apply in a case like the present, where both parties were, at the time at which Allphones sought to terminate, in breach in a way amounting to repudiation of their obligations. Allphones was not an innocent party, any more than Hoy Mobile. I am satisfied that Allphones considered itself to be free to account for commission as and when it pleased and in the way it pleased, regardless of its contractual obligation pay the whole amount of MTSC due to Hoy Mobile on the construction of the franchise agreement I have found. Each had engaged in dishonest conduct towards the other in a way which evinced an intention not to be bound.

The deliberate concealment from the franchisees, including Hoy Mobile, of the true amounts paid to Allphones as commission for those activations is evidenced in the various emails to which I have referred and the conduct described by Mr Nicoll in his evidence. That conduct places Allphones' behaviour outside that of a party who is seeking to perform the contract according to its terms, but acting on an incorrect interpretation of it: cp DTR Nominees 138 CLR at 432 per Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ. The intention to conceal payments from the franchisees demonstrated a consciousness on Allphones' part that the revelation of what it was doing would be seen, correctly, by the franchisees as a fundamental departure from the conventional understanding of how their commissions were earned. Allphones was not seeking to perform the contract according to its terms, but rather was seeking to perform it as and when it pleased and in the manner it pleased.

Thus, at the time at which Allphones learnt of Hoy Mobile's fraudulent conduct, Allphones itself was evincing an intention not to be bound and to perform the franchise agreement as and in the manner it pleased. Although it was carrying out some of its obligations, it was concealing the existence of other obligations from Hoy Mobile, conscious that Hoy Mobile was asking for more detail about the way in which its commission had been calculated.</text>

Allphones argued that I should follow the Court of Appeal's decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 on the construction of Commonwealth legislation in accordance with the principles in Farah 230 CLR at 151-152 [135]. However, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal's decision should not be followed for three reasons: First, that decision was on a different legislation, namely an earlier version of the Code that was not in force at the time when Hoy Mobile and Allphones entered into the franchise agreement. The subsequent decision of the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; (2007) 237 ALR 512 demonstrates that the approach to construction adopted by the Court of Appeal was wrong (see below). (I note that special leave to appeal from the decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was granted by Gummow and Crennan JJ: Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA Trans 89.) I am convinced that the decision of the Court of Appeal is plainly wrong.</text>

<tocase>Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/51.html</AustLII>
<text>Each party here referred to the somewhat problematic (in this context) decision in Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 to support its case. There, the time for completion of a contract for the sale of land had been made of the essence. Two days before the contractual date for completion, the vendors' solicitor told the purchasers' solicitor that the vendors would not be in a position to complete on the appointed day. Neither party attempted to settle on the due date, but two days afterwards, the purchasers gave a notice of rescission.

Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, in separate judgments, held that the purchasers could rescind and were entitled to the return of the deposit. Mason CJ dissented. A number of the justices discussed, in obiter dicta, the position where there was an actual breach of contract entitling the other party to treat that breach as a repudiation. Mason CJ said that the principle established by the earlier decisions was that ( Foran 168 CLR at 408): 
 
 '[I]n relation to termination for actual breach ... the plaintiff is required to show that he was ready and willing to perform the contract if it had not been repudiated by the plaintiff. In other words, the requirement is that the plaintiff be ready and willing to perform except to the extent that the defendant dispensed with his performance. ... [I]n the case of actual breach the requirement of readiness and willingness is more stringent; it continues through to the time of performance. That is because the termination of the contract does not antedate the time for performance.'

Mason CJ applied what Dixon CJ had said in Rawson v Hobbs [1961] HCA 72 ; (1961) 107 CLR 466 at 481 (see Foran 168 CLR at 405-406). Dixon CJ had said in Rawson 107 CLR at 481 (Windeyer J agreed at 107 CLR at 492): 
 
 'One must be very careful to see that nothing but a substantial incapacity or definitive resolve or decision against doing in the future what the contract requires is counted as an absence of readiness and willingness. On the other hand it is absurd to treat one party as tied to the performance of an executory contract although the other has neither the means nor intention of performing his part when his turn comes, simply because his incapacity to do so is not necessarily final or logically complete.'

Mason CJ said that Dixon CJ's reasoning applied to the entitlement of a party to terminate a contract for breach. Mason CJ continued ( Foran 168 CLR at 406-407): 
 
 'A party who is disabled from suing for damages because he is not ready and willing to perform in the sense discussed above cannot exercise a right to treat himself as discharged from the contract on the ground that the other party is in breach of an essential term or is otherwise in fundamental breach of the contract.'

Brennan J ( Foran 168 CLR at 424) said: 
 
 'Where a party claims to be entitled to rescind an executory contract on account of the other party's repudiation (whether by way of anticipatory breach or incapacity), the first party must show not only the other's repudiation but his own readiness and willingness up to the time of rescission to perform his essential obligations under the contract: [ Rawson 107 CLR at 480-481] ... Since a party's right to rescind an executory contract for the other party's repudiation is limited to cases where the first party is ready and willing to perform, neither party is treated as without fault where both would be at fault were the contract to continue until the time for performance arrives .' (emphasis added)

He too applied what Dixon CJ had said in Rawson 107 CLR at 481, see Foran 168 CLR at 425. When Brennan J referred to an entitlement to rescind, he used 'rescind' in the sense of one party electing to terminate for breach or repudiation by the other, as explained in Commissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 22 at [2] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.

Brennan J identified the principle to be applicable in the case of an anticipatory breach of mutually dependent and concurrent obligations, occasioned by one party informing the other that he would not be able to perform at the time for performance. His Honour said that, unless the other party were ready and willing at the time when that intimation was given, the first party's failure to perform was not a breach of contract. Thus, where the party to whom the intimation had been given was itself substantially incapable of future performance of its obligation, or had already definitively resolved or decided not to perform it, that party was also not ready and willing. Thus, he could not treat as a breach the other's intimation that performance would not be given on the future day for performance. If that be so, it must follow that neither party could have terminated for the failure of the other on the appointed date to offer performance (see Foran 168 CLR at 427). Brennan J said ( Foran 168 CLR at 246-427): 
 
 'Of course, it is possible that a party who is not disposed to perform or capable of performing in any event may not be dispensed from his obligation by receipt of an intimation of non-performance: he may not have acted in reliance on the intimation at all. But, whether or not he placed some reliance on the intimation in abstaining from performance of his own obligation, a disposition not to perform or an incapacity to perform when the intimation was given denies the character of breach to a failure to perform by the party giving the intimation .' (emphasis added)

Deane J decided the case on the basis of an estoppel being created by the intimation that a party would not be in a position to complete on the appointed day. He then expressed the obiter view that, while the absence of the other party being able to show that it was ready and willing would preclude it from seeking an order for damages or specific performance, that other party could terminate based on the intimated repudiation: Foran 168 CLR at 437-438. He said that if the position were otherwise, the law would require useless and futile expenditure by innocent parties of whatever time, effort or money was necessary to place themselves in a position where they could positively demonstrate actual or potential ability to perform a contract in order to be able to bring it to an end on the ground that it had already been repudiated by the other party. He said ( Foran 168 CLR at 438): 
 
 '... it is difficult to see why the law should insist that, even though both parties to a contract have repudiated it, the contract must hang like an albatross around their necks unless and until they can reach a new agreement about its termination.'

Dawson J said that readiness and willingness included capacity ( Foran 168 CLR at 451). He cautioned against carrying too far the principle that repudiation of a contract by one party could absolve the other party from the obligation of tendering useless performance. He said that when the principle applied, it could reduce the extent or alter the nature of the readiness and willingness which a plaintiff was required to show, but there was no reason why it should be eliminated as a requirement entirely. His Honour continued ( Foran 168 CLR at 452): 
 
 'A party should not be able to sue for breach if he is unable or unwilling to carry out his part of the bargain; where, in other words, he is not the innocent party. Even where a party has been absolved by the repudiating party from performing his future obligations under the contract he must show that at the time of the repudiation he was ready and willing to complete the contract had it not been repudiated. But in proving his readiness and willingness where he has been absolved from tendering performance he may not have to prove a great deal.'

But nonetheless, in order to be able to terminate, Dawson J held ( Foran 168 CLR at 454): 
 
 'All that the purchasers were required to show was that at the time of the repudiation, that is, at the time they were absolved from future performance, there was not a "substantial incapacity" on their part or a "definitive resolve or decision" against the performance of their obligations.'

Gaudron J analysed the position as being one in which the contract had come to an end because neither party performed on the day made essential for performance, and that was confirmed by the notice of rescission ( Foran 168 CLR at 459).

In Highmist Pty Ltd v Tricare Ltd [2005] QCA 357 at [61] - [62] , Keane JA (with whom Jerrard JA at [1] and Cullinane J at [66] agreed) expressed the obiter view that it did not make much commercial sense to say that where both parties had expressed a firm resolve not to perform the contract, the contract continues 'in existence in some legal limbo' for the reason that neither party is ready, willing and able to perform. His view is similar to that of Deane J in Foran 168 CLR at 438. Keane JA said that in such circumstances, the case could be characterised as one of termination by mutual consent, although he recognised that his was a tentative view and that the issue did not need to be resolved in order for him to decide the case: Highmist [2005] QCA 357 at [62] . Keane JA did not examine the authorities.

In Paal Wilson [1983] 1 AC at 915C-916D Lord Diplock discussed the entry of both parties to an executory contract into a 'new contract' which he styled 'the contract of abandonment'. He explained that in such a case, each party promises by words or conduct to release the other from further performances of obligations on its part which remain to be performed, including the obligation to pay damages. And in Australian law the parties to a contract can so conduct themselves that they can be seen to have mutually abandoned or abrogated the contract; for example where neither takes any steps to perform over a period: see Summers v The Commonwealth [1918] HCA 33 ; (1918) 25 CLR 144 at 151-152 per Isaacs J; DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423 at 434 per Stephen Mason and Jacobs JJ; Foran 168 CLR at 422-423 per Brennan J.

Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA also referred to what Ipp J had said in Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (1992) 11 WAR 40 at 50-51 (Pidgeon ACJ and Franklyn J agreeing). The Full Court there was dealing with an appeal from the entry of summary judgment. Ipp J noted that the argument concerning the question whether a party in breach was entitled to terminate was faintly argued and had not been canvassed fully by counsel. He distinguished Foran [1989] HCA 51 ; 168 CLR 385 and Lombok Pty Ltd v Supetina Pty Ltd (1987) 14 FCR 226 from the facts of case before the Full Court saying that the terminating party's rights to payment of money were independent of, and not concurrent with, the obligations alleged to have been breached by it. He said that there was nothing in the principles in those cases to prevent the party allegedly in breach from relying on non-payment of progress claims to terminate the contract.

While the dicta of the Court of Appeal in Roadshow Entertainment 42 NSWLR at 481B-C are of great weight, I am of opinion that on analysis, they are inconsistent with the considered, albeit equally obiter dicta views of three of the justices: Foran 168 CLR at 405-408 per Mason CJ, 424, 427 per Brennan J and 452, 454 per Dawson J.

I am of opinion that in the contractual position which I have found, where each party was in default and acted dishonestly in respect of its financial accountability to the other, neither party was able to rely upon its contractual or common law rights to terminate the franchise agreement in late August 2006. While that may create a situation which Deane J described in Foran 168 CLR at 438 of making the franchise agreement 'hang like an albatross around their necks', I prefer the views of Mason CJ, Brennan and Dawson JJ that a party who wishes to terminate must be ready and willing to perform at the time at which the right is sought to be exercised.

Each party was in breach of the franchise agreement in a way which, had the other known of or appreciated that breach prior to late August 2006, would have entitled it to terminate, subject to it not being in any relevant breach itself. That is, Hoy Mobile was in breach of cl 9.3(viii), because it it had been fraudulent in connection with the operation of the franchised business through the unlocking and sale of mobile phones and its failure to account for the illicit profits that it had made from that activity. Likewise, Allphones was evincing an intention not to be bound by its obligation to pay the MTSC in the various manners in which I have found.

Each party's conduct amounted to an assertion by it of the freedom to act as and when it pleased in respect of fundamental obligations to the other. Each party was behaving quite dishonestly towards the other in relation to the performance of its obligations under the franchise agreement. Although Hoy Mobile did not plead that Allphones had committed fraud, Allphones' behaviour, in misrepresenting what carriers were paying as MTSC and keeping the difference, was every bit as dishonest as Hoy Mobile's fraud.

In my opinion, for the reasons given by Mason CJ in Foran 168 CLR at 408, Allphones was not entitled to exercise its rights under cl 9.3(viii). In August 2006, Allphones was not ready or willing to perform the franchise agreement. Nor has it proved that it is now ready or willing, so its cross-claim must fail.

Hoy Mobile argued that Allphones acted in a fiduciary capacity in collecting commission for franchisees and that it had to account in respect of the MTSC. Allphones contended that their relationship was entirely contractual, and that Allphones did not hold or receive money in a fiduciary relationship, but rather pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement.</text>

<tocase>Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 452</tocase>
<text>The cognate transaction between Vodafone, through the agency of Allphones and Hoy Mobile, and the customer, involved the ultimate sale of the 'free' phone. The phone was not, in fact, 'free' to the customer but was part of the consideration provided by Vodafone under the plan it entered with its customer. The use of the word 'free' in this context is apt to mislead: cp Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 452 at 483B-G per Black CJ, von Doussa and Cooper JJ.

Mr Nicoll's description of Allphones' internal accounting, in the absence of any documentary evidence, was also revealing of the nature of the relationship between Alllphones and Vodafone. He said that Allphones could determine what the 'rebate', or amount it attributed to the sale price of the phone, would be. That is, Allphones could determine the amount of profit made on the transactions, as between itself and Vodafone, by selecting both the phone to be supplied to the customer, and the price to be attributed to it in accounting to Hoy Mobile.

Mr Lynch and Mr Bell characterised Allphones' accounting treatment of the transaction between it and Vodafone as a sale of goods. I accept their evidence and find that this was, indeed, a sale of goods. Allphones' internal accounting showed that it was treating the receipt from Vodafone as part of the calculation of the cost of goods sold, and not simply as the payment of commission by Vodafone. Allphones' gross profit would depend on the price it chose to attribute as the 'cost' of the phone in the transaction.</text>

<text>In Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 at 55 Kitto J said that the person with the choice might keep the question open '... so long as it did nothing to affirm the contract and so long as the [other party's] position was not prejudiced in consequence of the delay'. He said that when the vendor in that case told the purchaser that it would not rescind a contract for the sale of land before a particular date if the purchaser paid an additional sum for interest, costs and expenses, the vendor was doing no more than promising that it would not elect to rescind the contract before that date if the conditions were complied with. Kitto J said that in that case a grant of an extension of time was not an election to affirm but, rather, amounted to an announcement of an intention to refrain from electing either way until the money had been paid or the extended time for performance had elapsed: see too Champtaloup v Thomas [1976] 2 NSWLR 264 at 268C-269B per Glass JA; 273D-274D per Mahoney JA; Street CJ agreeing with both at 266: Hunter BNZ Finance v GC Maloney Pty Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 420 at 435C-436B per Giles J: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 89-92 [356] - [364] per Finn J. And, as the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber written by Blackburn J (see Scarf 7 App Cas at 360) established, this principle applies to a party to a contract who discovers his entry into it was induced by the fraud of the other: Clough v London &amp; North Western Railway Co (1871) LR 7 Ex 26 at 34-35. 22.2 Consideration

Allphones accepted that, while a requirement to act in good faith was implied in many contracts, it said that was not necessarily so in every contract. As Finn J observed in GEC Marconi 128 FCR at 208-209 [920] it is not yet clear in Australian law whether a duty of good faith and fair dealing is implied as term of all contracts, or is an incident of particular classes of contract. I need not decide that here because I am not persuaded that Mr Donnellan was motivated by an extraneous purpose, or that he acted capriciously or otherwise than in good faith when Allphones was contemplating the exercise of its right to terminate in early July 2006, or when he caused the notice of intention to terminate to be given in late August 2006. I find that Mr Donnellan was genuinely concerned by the discovery of the fraud in which Hoy Mobile had been engaged. He was entitled to be so concerned.

A party to a contract is entitled to exercise contractual rights conferred on him or her honestly. Rarely do people act from a single motive, particularly where they have been involved in a long-term relationship with the other party or parties. In a contractual context, relationships can give rise to a complex set of considerations which one party may apply to the other. Thus, in a contract for the sale of goods where time is of the essence, and one party defaults in timeous performance, the law merchant recognises that the innocent party has a right to terminate. And such rights exist in the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) and its analogues.

Thus, when a vendor fails to deliver goods, or a purchaser fails to pay for them, on the due date, the innocent party is permitted to terminate without being subjected to an enquiry as to its motive. Often merchants terminate contracts when the other party defaults so as to take advantage of a substantive change in the market price for the goods that has occurred between the date of contract and the date on which default occurs. Indeed, the primary reason for termination at that time may be that the innocent party wants to get the benefit of the market change. In one sense, that motivation could be characterised as a purpose extraneous to the contract because it implies a disloyalty to the mutually co-operative relationship created by the contract. However, such a view would protect contract breakers from the consequences of their own disloyalty to the contractual obligation of which they were in breach.</text>

In Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v ACN 053 006 269 Pty Ltd (Receiver &amp; Manager Appointed) (1997) 42 NSWLR 462 at 481B-C Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA, in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales said: 
 
 'A party in breach of non-essential terms who has not repudiated may rescind for fundamental breach: see Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26; State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [[1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277] (at 286-287). A party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach: see State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd (at 285-287); compare Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (1992) 11 WAR 40 at 50-51. Roadshow , we consider, was not, by reason of its conduct, unable to terminate on the ground of CEL/Vision's repudiation.'

<tocase>Green v Sommerville (1979) 141 CLR 59</tocase>
<text>Thus, three of the justices (Mason CJ in dissent, with Brennan and Dawson JJ) expressed the obiter view that where both parties were in actual (as opposed to anticipatory) breach of a fundamental term, or otherwise evincing an intention not to be bound, neither could terminate. The three justices did not confine their expression of the operation of this principle to cases of mutual or dependent obligations. Rather, they expressed the principle as deriving from a general readiness and willingness of each party to perform his obligations at the relevant time. Earlier, in Green v Sommerville [1979] HCA 60 ; (1979) 141 CLR 594 at 609 Mason J (with whom Murphy and Aickin JJ agreed) recognised that '[a]n obligation may be essential, yet not interdependent with an obligation imposed on the other party to the contract ...'</text>

<tocase>Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135</tocase>
<text>Lord Diplock made the telling observation in his classic speech in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135 at 150C-E that in ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. He pointed out that, in greater or less degree, according to their temperaments, training and intelligence, men and women are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning and leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence. People tend not to recognise the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. And, he said, that despite the imperfection of mental processes by which a belief is arrived at, it may still be 'honest', that is, a positive belief that the conclusion reached is true. He said this in the context of assessing whether a person may or may not have been malicious for the purpose of the law of qualified privilege. But it is an observation about human behaviour. What Lord Diplock said can be applied as well to the way in which people act in contractual relationships.

As I have found, Mr Donnellan sought to give Hoy Mobile an opportunity to explain its conduct from 7 July 2006. He was the person within Allphones who made the decision issue the notice of intention to terminate. I am satisfied that he honestly believed that Allphones should terminate the franchise agreement because it was not in Allphones' interest to have a franchisee which had engaged in the fraud which Hoy Mobile had. The fraud was serious and, having seen and heard Mr Donnellan, I am satisfied he decided to terminate the franchise agreement because of the undesirability of having a relationship with Hoy Mobile as a party which had committed that fraud.

No doubt other factors, including some irritation at the way Hoy Mobile was behaving, may have been a part of Mr Donnellan's thinking processes, but I am quite unpersuaded that he acted, and thus Allphones acted, otherwise that in good faith in exercising the power to terminate. I reject this ground of Hoy Mobile's case.</text>

<tocase>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App Cas 439</tocase>
<text>The position is analogous to the situation in which parties to a contract enter into a course of negotiation which has the effect of one leading the other reasonably to suppose that the strict legal rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, pending the outcome of the negotiation. Here, Hoy Mobile's request of 10 July that Allphones hold a meeting on its terms, can be seen as such a suspension. In those circumstances equity would not allow the parties' strict legal rights to be enforced so as to deprive Allphones of a right to terminate the franchise agreement because it acted on Hoy Mobile's request to delay doing so: cp Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App Cas 439 at 448 per Lord Cairns LC (explaining the doctrine of equitable estoppel). Although no equitable estoppel was alleged here, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that nothing Allphones did after the exchange of emails on 10 July 2006 and until the meeting of 22 August 2006 amounted to an unequivocal election involving a choice between inconsistent rights.</text>

<text>In Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 at 55 Kitto J said that the person with the choice might keep the question open '... so long as it did nothing to affirm the contract and so long as the [other party's] position was not prejudiced in consequence of the delay'. He said that when the vendor in that case told the purchaser that it would not rescind a contract for the sale of land before a particular date if the purchaser paid an additional sum for interest, costs and expenses, the vendor was doing no more than promising that it would not elect to rescind the contract before that date if the conditions were complied with. Kitto J said that in that case a grant of an extension of time was not an election to affirm but, rather, amounted to an announcement of an intention to refrain from electing either way until the money had been paid or the extended time for performance had elapsed: see too Champtaloup v Thomas [1976] 2 NSWLR 264 at 268C-269B per Glass JA; 273D-274D per Mahoney JA; Street CJ agreeing with both at 266: Hunter BNZ Finance v GC Maloney Pty Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 420 at 435C-436B per Giles J: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 89-92 [356] - [364] per Finn J.

<text>Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ held that the analogue of s 51AC required the Court to focus primarily on the unconscionable conduct of the corporation and to determine whether that conduct was contrary to the norm of conscientious behaviour. They held that the conduct in that case insisted of a carefully formulated and systematic approach which clearly offended against basic notions of good conscience and fair play: National Exchange at 148 FCR at 143 [44]. Although their Honours were speaking of s 12CC of the ASIC Act , their remarks apply equally to the notion of 'unconscionable conduct' in its analogue, s 51AC: Cannon Australia Pty Ltd v Patton [2007] NSWCA 246 at [43] per Campbell JA, with whom Harrison J agreed. Campbell JA had referred ([2007] NSWCA 246 at [40]) to the earlier decision of a Full Court of this Court in Hurley v McDonald's Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 1728 ; (2000) ATPR 41-741 at [21] - [22] . There Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ said that for conduct to be regarded at an unconscionable, serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable had to be demonstrated. They found that the term carried with it the meaning given by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, namely '... actions showing no regard for conscience, or that are irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable', relying on Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron [1996] FCA 1483 ; (1996) 66 FCR 246 at 262.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/27.html</AustLII>
<text>In Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) [1993] HCA 27 ; (1993) 182 CLR 26 at 41, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 
 
 'The true nature of election is brought out in this sentence from the seminal work of Spencer Bower and Turner, The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (3rd ed (1977), p 313): 
 

 
 
 'It is of the essence of election that the party electing shall be "confronted" with two mutually exclusive courses of action between which he must, in fairness to the other party, make his choice.'

Their Honours had pointed out that the consequences of an election may well be serious for the party electing and that, in particular, election involves the abandoning of a right that is available. Thus, they held that a party could only be held to have elected if he had so communicated his election to the other party in clear and unequivocal terms: Immer 182 CLR at 39. They noted that there was a distinction between the situation where a party to a contract, faced with the choice of terminating it or keeping it on foot, chooses to terminate as opposed to when the contract remains on foot. In the case of a termination, the party ordinarily will have acted in a way that leaves no doubt as to the choice made, which would be clearly inconsistent with the exercise of the right to keep the contract on foot, because it no longer exists: Immer 182 CLR at 41. Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ emphasised that at the heart of election was the idea of a confrontation which, in turn, produced the necessity of the party confronted making a choice: Immer 182 CLR at 42.

Mere awareness of a right to rescind or terminate or of facts giving rise to a right to rescind or terminate will not necessarily have the consequence that the party will be held to have elected to affirm the contract if he or she acts on the basis that the contract remains on foot. As Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ noted ( Immer 182 CLR at 43): 
 
 'Such an implication is at odds with the notion of being confronted with the necessity of making a choice.'

In the present case, Hoy Mobile did not identify when, in the period between Allphones learning of the transaction with Mr Quarmby in late May and giving its notice of intention to terminate in late August 2006, Allphones was required to make an election either to terminate the franchise agreement or abandon its right to do so. While in Mr Donnellan's email of 10 July 2006 Allphones had stated that it was relying on fraud, the precise nature of the fraud on which it was relying had not been revealed by it, despite requests through Hoy Mobile's solicitor, that it do so. Nor, had Hoy Mobile disclosed anything about the existence, nature or extent of its fraud to Allphones. Hoy Mobile, however, was acutely aware of the fraud it had committed and uniquely placed to understand its full implications.

And, his Lordship said that where there is a right to elect '... the party is not bound to elect once; he may wait and think which way he will exercise his election, so long as he can do so without injuring other persons ...' ( Scarf 7 App Cas at 360, emphasis added). Lord Blackburn emphasised that election involved, first, the making of the choice between one of two inconsistent rights and, secondly, the notification or communication of that choice to the party against whom the rights existed in a way that affected that other party. Hence, in Immer 182 CLR at 43 Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to the party being '... confronted with the necessity of making a choice'.

As at 9 June 2006, when Allphones demanded the return of an unamended RCTI agreement from Hoy Mobile, I am satisfied that it had knowledge of what happened in the sale to Mr Quarmby. However, I am not satisfied that at that time it had discovered or fully absorbed the implications of two recharge cards appearing on its point-of-sale records in connection with the payment of $199 for Mr Quarmby's phone. Nor am I satisfied that Allphones' asking for the complete RCTI agreement to be signed was inconsistent with Allphones keeping alive its right to terminate. After all, there was no provision in the franchise agreement which required Hoy Mobile to execute the RCTI agreement. Its execution was proffered by Allphones as a means of facilitating prompt payment of money which was payable once the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) legislation were satisfied. I am not satisfied that, at this time, Hoy Mobile had any belief that Allphones had made a choice to affirm the franchise agreement. At that time, Hoy Mobile was ignorant that Allphones had any awareness of its fraud. It did not believe that Allphones made an election at any time in June 2006. Indeed, Hoy Mobile was then complaining directly, and through its solicitor, that Allphones was refusing to recognise the existence of any franchise agreement. Hoy Mobile was hardly in a position to suggest that, in fairness to it, Allphones was confronted with the requirement to make a choice then and there: see Immer 182 CLR at 41.

Nor, apart from ease of administration, and the obligation to pay Hoy Mobile more promptly, was there any identifiable 'benefit' accruing to Allphones from seeking execution of the RCTI agreement. I am of opinion that Allphones had insufficient knowledge by the time its receipt of the RCTI agreement on 15 June to find that it had elected not to terminate the franchise agreement by reason of Mr Hoy's fraudulent conduct. (b) Store refresh requirement

By the time the store refresh letter was sent to all franchisees on or after 29 June 2006, Allphones was aware of skimming having occurred at Hoy Mobile through both Mr Quarmby's transaction and Mr Shepherd's revelations as to what had happened while he worked there. However, Allphones was still seeking legal advice as to its position. Mr Berner only interviewed Mr Quarmby on 30 June 2006, although I infer that the information Mr Quarmby had given to Mr Ilievski had been passed on to Allphones' solicitors by that time. And, by 30 June, Allphones' solicitors were proceeding on the basis that they were acting in anticipation of litigation as well as giving Allphones advice as to its position.

I am satisfied that prior to Mr Donnellan sending his letter on 7 July 2006, Allphones had not communicated to Hoy Mobile that it had chosen between two mutually exclusive courses of action with which it had been confronted, at that time and between which, in fairness to Hoy Mobile, Allphones had to choose: Immer 182 CLR at 41. In addition, Mr and Mrs Hoy did not give evidence that they believed that Allphones had affirmed the franchise agreement existence prior to this time. To the contrary they perceived its actions as breaches of the franchise agreement, or denials of its existence.

Once Mr Donnellan's letter of 7 July had been received by Hoy Mobile, it was clear to both parties that Allphones wished to discuss a serious matter. By the following Monday, 10 July, Allphones had communicated that it believed Hoy Mobile had committed a fraud. Mr Hoy was instantly aware, on receiving that news from his wife, that the fraud concerned the unlocking of phones. Mr Donnellan's evidence was that he wanted a meeting so that he could hear what Hoy Mobile had to say about the allegations. I accept his evidence that he wanted to give Hoy Mobile an opportunity to provide its response, if any, to the allegations which were being made by Allphones.

However, Mr Hoy never attended a meeting with Allphones after 9 May 2006, when Mr Harkin had insulted and berated him during the quarterly review. I have some sympathy with Mr Hoy's reluctance to attend a further meeting after that experience. Allphones submitted that Mr Harkin's behaviour during this quarterly review was merely to be characterised as part of the rough and tumble of business dealings. I reject that submission. Of course, business dealings can be, and often are, robust exchanges. Mr Harkin did not offer any justification for his abusive conduct towards Mr Hoy on 9 May at the quarterly review. Objectively, there was no justification for it. He acted in a bullying, offensive and overbearing manner towards Mr Hoy. I reject the argument that such behaviour should be characterised as acceptable or normal in the relationship between franchisor and franchisee. Obviously, allowances must be made for different people and the way in which they react and interact. Having had the benefit of seeing both Mr Hoy and Mr Harkin in the witness box, I am satisfied that in a commercial negotiation and meeting, Mr Hoy was quite capable of looking after himself and his own interests. He was no 'wilting flower'. However, in his relationship with Mr Harkin, Mr Hoy was not in a particularly powerful position. To be abused and sworn at as Mr Hoy was, during the course of a business meeting, for no good reason, was not something which, in the ordinary course, anyone should have to face. Mr Harkin's behaviour was inappropriate. I do not draw any adverse inference against Mr Hoy for refusing to have a further meeting with Mr Harkin.

Through neither party's fault, a meeting was unable to be arranged between 7 July and 22 August. During that period, Hoy Mobile wished the contract to remain on foot while Allphones had indicated that it was keeping its options open until Hoy Mobile had had an opportunity to explain its, prima facie, fraudulent conduct. A reasonable person in Hoy Mobile's position could not have understood Allphones' conduct at this point to amount to an affirmation of the franchise agreement. Both parties were still pursuing the course of holding a meeting for the purposes set out in Mr Donnellan's letter of 7 July. That course was being pursued with Hoy Mobile's full knowledge, and indeed at its request, through Mr Birch's email of 10 July to that effect. And, neither Mr nor Mrs Hoy gave evidence that they understood that Allphones had chosen to affirm during this period. Allphones was not making a choice of affirming the franchise agreement, while holding matters in abeyance pending the meeting at which Hoy Mobile could explain its position. Rather (as Kitto J observed was permissible in Goonan 111 CLR at 55) Allphones had said that it intended to refrain from electing until the meeting occurred. Nor, in fairness to Hoy Mobile, was Allphones required to make a choice before that meeting had occurred: Immer 182 CLR at 41.

However, those situations are far removed from that presented here. Hoy Mobile asked Allphones not to terminate pending a meeting. It cannot now say that, because Allphones expressly acceded to its request on 10 July for a meeting, it affirmed the franchise agreement. At the heart of the principle of election, as Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ showed in Immer 182 CLR at 41, is not only the confrontation of the elector with a choice, but also the requirement that when so confronted the elector '... must, in fairness to the other party, make his choice' (emphasis added). Having requested Allphones not to make the choice before Hoy Mobile could meet with it, Hoy Mobile cannot complain that, in fairness to it, Allphones should be held to have made a choice that neither party intended it to have made.

Each party accepted that neither would be taken by the other as having unequivocally chosen between inconsistent rights until at least the time after the meeting had occurred. Fairness, in the sense referred to in Immer 182 CLR at 41, would be eschewed, not advanced, if Allphones' accommodation of Hoy Mobile's request not to terminate until a meeting occurred, were used to preclude it from terminating at or immediately after that meeting.

I find that, in July and August 2006, Allphones was unaware that Mr Hoy had been committing the fraud beginning sometime early in 2004. All that Allphones knew at the time was what Mr Shepherd and Mr Quarmby had told it. There is no evidence that Allphones had any other knowledge of when, or the circumstances in which the fraud first commenced. Nor did Allphones have knowledge that the fraud continued after Mr Quarmby had purchased his phone, although I have no doubt it suspected that this had occurred. But suspicion is one thing, and knowledge another. Mr Hoy had made no, let alone full and frank, disclosure of what he was doing at any time prior to Allphones issuing the notice of intention to terminate. While Allphones may have suspected that more was involved than it knew, given the element of fairness inherent in the concept of election ( Immer 182 CLR at 41) Hoy Mobile's assertion of election by Allphones based on incomplete information and disclosure by Hoy Mobile, does not provide any occasion to find that Allphones elected to affirm the franchise agreement.

So far as Hoy Mobile relied on matters occurring after 7 July 2006, I find that the lifting of the stock and commission holds were not unequivocal affirmations of the franchise agreement. Commissions had been earned prior to that time. It would be unjust to impute to Allphones an election, once for all to give up its right to terminate for Hoy Mobile's undoubted fraud, simply because, in ignorance of the full nature and extent of that fraud, it acceded to Hoy Mobile's request not to terminate until the 22 August meeting could occur.

And, Hoy Mobile's argument that Allphones had delayed unreasonably, until 28 August, from issuing the notice of its intention to terminate is, in my view, without substance. Hoy Mobile had requested the delay. Through neither party's fault, the meeting could not be arranged earlier than 22 August. Any delay in the six days after that was inconsequential. Mr Harkin said Allphones would issue the notice. Hoy Mobile did not contend that anything occurred, after he said this and before 28 August, which amounted to an election by Allphones.</text>

<text>A reasonable person in the position of the parties here would reject as inappropriate a construction of their franchise agreement that it had no territory at all. The task of construing 'N/A' as the description of the territory must be approached in the manner described by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ; applied in International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 242 ALR 47 at 63 [53] per Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. That requires the Court to put to one side the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about the rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations, and to concentrate on the principle of objectivity for the ascertainment and definition of those rights and liabilities. Their Honours said that what mattered was what each party, by words or conduct, would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. They continued: 
 
 'References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreements. The meaning of the terms of the contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction ( Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at 461-462 [22] .)'</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 29</tocase>
<text>The conversation that he denied was the one in which Mr Hoy had asserted that Mr Donnellan agreed to a 5 km radius territory. Mr Donnellan was then pressed about what he now claimed had occurred. He gave this evidence: 
 
 'Now, what do you say Mr Hoy said to you on this occasion in 2003 when he raised the subject of territory? Was it him who raised it or you who raised it? --- He raised it with Mark McClennan. I was walking past; asked how things were going, and he said, "What about territories?" I said, "We don't give them, mate."' 
 

 
I do not believe Mr Donnellan's evidence that such a conversation occurred. Mr Hoy was not cross-examined about any such conversation when he first gave evidence. I infer that this was because the conversation was first raised by Mr Donnellan in his cross-examination. When he was recalled at the end of the trial, Mr Hoy denied the conversation asserted by Mr Donnellan. Mr McClennan was available. He had a position as a consultant with Allphones, but was not called to give evidence. I infer that nothing Mr McClennan could have said would have assisted Allphones' case: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.

Allphones contended, based on the assertions initially made, but later disavowed by Mr Donnellan, that at the time the franchise agreement with Hoy Mobile was entered into, the only territory which Allphones was prepared to grant was limited to the physical shop in which the franchise was conducted. I reject this argument. Such a result does not fit within the matrix of mutually known facts or the very terms of the franchise agreement itself.

First, Mr Donnellan never told Mr Hoy, prior to signing the franchise agreement, words to the effect that the territory was the area of the shop lease. There is no evidence that Mr Hoy was informed to that effect prior to Hoy Mobile's entry into the franchise agreement.</text>

<tocase>Ketchell v Master of Education Services Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2007/161.html</AustLII>
<text>Allphones argued that the franchise agreement was void because of its contravention of cl 11 of the Code. It relied on the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal on the earlier version of the Code, in force in early 2000, in Ketchell v Master of Education Services Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 161. Mason P, with whom Basten JA and Handley AJA agreed, held that s 51AD of the Trade Practices Act (prohibiting contraventions of the Code), read with the predecessor of cl 11 of the Code, directly prohibited the contract there in question: Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 at [30] . Mason P said: 
 
 '[30] ... As regards the instant transaction, cl 11(1) provided, in terms, that (given the non-receipt of a written statement in accordance with that subclause) the respondent "must not" enter into the franchise agreement; and that it "must not" receive non-refundable payments under a franchise agreement. 
 

 
 
 [31] There is no need to seek guidance from implications in the legislative framework. This is not a case of implying from the silence of the legislature a statutory policy about illegality of contracting. What is prohibited under cl 11 is not just conduct but the contract itself and the recovery of money under it. ...' (emphasis added, footnote omitted) 
 

 
His Honour also said that the Act contained no provision empowering a court to relieve against non-compliance with the directly prohibitory terms of cl 11: Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 [32]. The Code was subsequently amended in October 2001.

The version of the Code in force in 2003 contained the following relevant provisions. Critically, cl 6A had been added to the earlier version that was in force for the purposes of the decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161. Clause 6A provided that the purpose of a disclosure document was to give a prospective or existing franchisee proposing to enter into, renew or extend a franchise agreement, information from the franchisor to help the franchisee to make a reasonably informed decision about the franchise; and to give the franchisee current information from the franchisor that was material to the running of the franchise business. And, cl 11(1) provided that the franchisor must not enter into, renew or extend a franchise agreement unless it had received from the franchisee or prospective franchisee a written statement that the franchisee or prospective franchisee had received, read and had a reasonable opportunity to understand the disclosure document and the Code. Next, cl 11(2) provided that before a franchise agreement was entered into, the franchisor had to receive from the prospective franchisee either:

Allphones argued that I should follow the Court of Appeal's decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 on the construction of Commonwealth legislation in accordance with the principles in Farah 230 CLR at 151-152 [135]. However, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal's decision should not be followed for three reasons: First, that decision was on a different legislation, namely an earlier version of the Code that was not in force at the time when Hoy Mobile and Allphones entered into the franchise agreement. The subsequent decision of the High Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; (2007) 237 ALR 512 demonstrates that the approach to construction adopted by the Court of Appeal was wrong (see below). (I note that special leave to appeal from the decision in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was granted by Gummow and Crennan JJ: Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA Trans 89.) I am convinced that the decision of the Court of Appeal is plainly wrong.

I am of opinion that, in such circumstances, it is plainly wrong and inconsistent with cl 6A and the Code as a whole to find that it was the intention of the Parliament to make a franchise agreement itself illegal, as opposed to stigmatising the conduct of the franchisor for its failure to comply with the Code. The consequence of Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 is that any, even the most insignificant, technical breach of cll 10 or 11 of the Code renders a franchise agreement void, even if the franchisee wishes to enforce it.

The intention of the Code to protect a franchisee would be defeated in many cases to which it applies if a franchise agreement entered into after a failure to comply with any provision of cll 10 or 11 was held void. When he said that there was no need to seek guidance from implications in the legislative framework, in my respectful opinion Mason P did not undertake the task of statutory construction emphasised in the decisions of the High Court to which I have referred. The whole of the Code and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act bearing on its application required careful attention to discern whether it, indeed, was the intention of the Code to strike down as void every franchise agreement which had been entered into in circumstances where there was a failure to comply, whether technically or deliberately, with any of the provisions of cll 10 or 11.

If the result in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 is correct, the franchisee may be put in breach of its lease because it never had a franchise agreement. It may be put in breach of arrangements with its bankers or financiers for the same reason. The consequences which could fall upon a franchisee were not addressed by Mason P, because he said that there was 'no need to seek guidance from implications in the legislative framework'. Yet one express purpose of the legislation was to protect one of the parties to such a contract by giving that party rights arising from a corporation's failure to comply with an industry code as an instance of unconscionable conduct (see s 51AC(3)(g) and 4(g)). If that could be established, the franchisee may be entitled to obtain relief from a franchise agreement or certain related conduct under the Trade Practices Act .

In my respectful opinion, although his Honour did not have the benefit of the reasoning in Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; 237 ALR 512 , which was delivered subsequently to the reasons in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 , the reasoning of Mason P is plainly wrong. In addition, Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was decided on different legislation: see McNamara 221 CLR at 661 [40]; Walker Corporation 242 ALR at 391 [31]. I am of opinion that the non-compliance by Allphones with its obligations under cl 11 of the Code did not make the franchise agreement void. That non-compliance is a factor which, had Hoy Mobile wished to do so, could have been raised by it to seek relief under s 87 of the Act. It would defeat the evident purpose of the Code if Allphones were entitled to rely on its own breach of its obligation imposed under cl 11 to deny a franchisee with whom it had entered into a contract, the entitlement to enforce that contract against it or to seek a variation of it or relief from it under the Act. For these reasons I reject Allphones' argument that the franchise agreement is void.

Hoy Mobile alleged that if the franchise agreement were found to be illegal and void, as Allphones had alleged in reliance on Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 , then much of Allphones' conduct since Hoy Mobile commenced operating as a franchisee was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act . I have found that the franchise agreement is a valid agreement, thus this basis for invoking s 51AC does not arise.

Next, Hoy Mobile alleged that, in the circumstances pleaded by it, it was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC for Allphones to deny that the franchise agreement contained or ought to contain the following three terms:

Based on my findings, the first two of those issues do not require consideration because no such terms were agreed. In relation to the third issue, the franchise agreement included, in substance, an entitlement of Hoy Mobile to be paid commissions as it claimed. Allphones was in breach of those obligations.

To summarise, I have found that: The territory granted to Hoy Mobile in the franchise agreement was the suburb of Eastgardens. Allphones was obliged under cll 7.4 and 7.5 to pay commission to Hoy Mobile on all sums which Allphones received from carriers in respect of sales and activations of plans effected by Hoy Mobile. The franchise agreement was not void because of Allphones' failure, before it was entered into, to comply with cll 10 and 11 of the Code, and that Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 should not be followed. Hoy Mobile was fraudulent in connection with the operation of the franchise business within the meaning of cl 9.3(viii) of the franchise agreement. Allphones did not know of that fraud and did not condone it. Nor did Allphones elect, after it learnt of the nature of the fraud, to affirm the franchise agreement. Allphones was not entitled to terminate the franchise agreement by reason of Hoy Mobile's fraudulent conduct because Allphones, itself, was not ready and willing to perform. This was because it, both, had evinced an intention not to be bound and had breached the essential term in cl 7.4 by its withholding and underpayment of commissions, and its dishonesty in concealing that conduct. Hoy Mobile was not entitled to be paid by Allphones: 
 (a) $18,000 in respect of co-op money when it began its franchise;
 
(b) $32,000 in respect of the benefit Hoy Mobile derived from its fraud.
 Allphones has not established that the amount it had charged Hoy Mobile in respect of the refresh charge was a reasonable sum to charge under cll 4, 6.23 or 6.35. In particular Allphones has shown that the sum was not reasonable by its failure to reduce it by the $1,100 paid to Allphones by Optus as a co-op payment for the purpose of defraying the store refresh charge for each Allphones' franchise. Allphones is obliged to pay Hoy Mobile the following for its breaches of the franchise agreement:
 Optus stretch bonus $ 16,388.63 Optus bonus and super bonus $ 27,944.39 Virgin commission $ 1,132.45 Vodafone commission $ 709.78 Hutchison commission $ 2041,66 EFTPOS fees $ 1,045.49 IT management fees $ 2,045.43 Administrative fees and bank charges unable to be allocated $ 3,581.49 Store refresh deduction $ 9,973.37 Diversions of 138000 number $ 1,500.00 Retention canvassing $ 6,507.60 Vodafone commissions from plans with 'free' phones $ 2,299.46 Sub-total $ 75,169.75 Less amount earned by Hoy Mobile's fraud ($ 32,000.00) Total $ 43,169.75 
 It may be necessary to add to this amount the sums which the parties agreed during the hearing that Allphones would pay Hoy Mobile. Allphones was not a fiduciary as alleged by Hoy Mobile. The franchise agreement remains on foot and does not need to be rectified. Allphones contravened s 51AC(1) of the Trade Practices Act because it engaged in conduct which was unconscionable in all the circumstances in connection in with the supply and acquisition from Hoy Mobile of services under the franchise agreement.

In the event that the parties cannot agree on the formulation of the orders, each should prepare its own draft of the orders and the matter can be re-listed for further argument. I will direct Hoy Mobile to serve its draft orders with supporting schedules by 3 June 2008 together with its written submissions in respect of costs and, Allphones to serve its response by 5 June 2008 together with written submissions in respect of any areas of disagreement. Any written submissions in reply should be served by Hoy Mobile by 6 June 2008, and I will relist the matter for the making of final orders on 10 June 2008.
 I certify that the preceding four hundred and thiry-one (431) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/61.html</AustLII>
<text>In Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council v Sanpine [2007] HCA 61 ; (2007) 241 ALR 88 at 101 [44] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ said that unwillingness or inability to perform a contract often is manifested most clearly by the conduct of a party when the time for performance arrives. They said: 'In contractual renunciation, actions may speak louder than words.' Their Honours held that it was important to classify whether the obligation with which there had been a failure to comply had been agreed by the contracting parties to be essential, or whether there had been a sufficiently serious breach of a non-essential term enlivening the right to terminate: Koompahtoo 241 ALR at 101 [47] and 102 [49]. They held that the interests of justice were promoted by limiting the right to rescind the contracts (i.e. terminate for breach) to instances of serious and substantial breaches of contract: Koompahtoo 241 ALR at 104 [52].

I am of opinion that the cumulative effects of Allphones' deliberate and secretive underpayments of commissions were of such seriousness that, had it wished to do so and been itself an innocent party, Hoy Mobile could have terminated the franchise agreement. 29.3 Entitlement to terminate: Interdependency and repudiation

It was an essential term under the franchise agreement that the franchisee (Hoy Mobile) be paid the commissions to which it was entitled arising from its performance of its obligations. The evidence established that Allphones was not paying commissions earned by Hoy Mobile in full, and sometimes at all. Just as Hoy Mobile's conduct in relation to the fraud evinced an intention not to be bound, Allphones' conduct in respect of the short payment of the commission can be described as conduct which evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the franchise agreement or to fulfil it in a manner substantially inconsistent with Allphones' obligations: Koompahtoo 241 ALR at 100 [44] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ applying; Laurinda 166 CLR at 634 per Mason CJ.</text>

<text>In Kyrwood v Drinkwater [2000] NSWCA 126 at [154] Powell JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed at [1]; see also the dissenting view of Fitzgerald JA at [231]-[251]) said: 
 
 'In Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613 it was held by this Court that, if non-compliance with a contractual obligation is to take away the defaulting party's right to terminate, there must be a direct causal relationship between the non-compliance and the failure to complete, the onus of proving which lies on the non-defaulting party, and there must be an absence of repudiation by the defaulting party prior to that time .

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/23.html</AustLII>
<text>It is not necessary, for repudiation of a contract, that the repudiator make plain that he will never perform his contractual obligations at all, as Deane and Dawson JJ pointed out in Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd [1989] HCA 23 ; (1989) 166 CLR 623 at 658-659. There, Mason CJ said that there was a difference between evincing an intention to carry out a contract only if and when it suited the party to do so, and evincing an intention to carry it out as and when it suited the party to do it. He said that in the first case, the party intended not to carry the contract out at all, in the event that it did not suit him. Whereas in the second case, the party intended to carry out the contract, but only to carry it out as and when it suited him. Mason CJ said that it is easier to say of the first than the second case that a party has evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the contract, although ultimately the question whether a party is taken to have evinced such an intention is determined objectively: Laurinda 166 CLR at 634; see also 643 per Brennan J, and 666 per Gaudron J.

<tocase>Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702</tocase>
<text>Where one of the parties to a contract has committed a fraud in its performance, the fraudster cannot complain that he or she has been prejudiced by acts of the other party done without sufficient knowledge of his or her fraud. That is why the courts have always held that fraud fundamentally affects the way in which relations between parties are viewed. As Denning LJ said in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702 at 712 (see also SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64 at 68 [15] - [16] ): 
 
 'No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. ... Fraud unravels everything.'

Allphones argued that because Hoy Mobile had engaged in a fraud which fell within cl 9.3(viii) of the franchise agreement and which had continued for a considerable period, it should be allowed to terminate pursuant to its express contractual right. In Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702 at 712-713, Denning LJ referred to Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 337-338; 1 Smith's LC, 13 th ed ,780, 799) where Buller J said: 
 
 'It is a common saying in our law books, that fraud vitiates every thing. I do not quarrel with the phrase, or mean in the smallest degree to impeach the various cases which have been founded on the proof of fraud. But we must recollect, that the principle which I have mentioned is always applied ad hominem . He who is guilty of a fraud shall never be permitted to avail himself of it; and if a contract founded in fraud be questioned between the parties to that contract, I agree, that as against the person who has committed the fraud, and who endeavours to avail himself of it, the contract shall be considered as null and void. ... Even as between the parties themselves we must not forget the figurative language of Lord Ch J Wilmot , who said [that]:

<text>In Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 70 ; (2001) 210 CLR 181 at 188 [11] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
 
 '[11] Interpretation of a written contract involves, as Lord Hoffmann has put it ( Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1997] UKHL 28 ; [1998] 1 WLR 896 at 912; [1997] UKHL 28 ; [1998] 1 All ER 98 at 114.

That knowledge may include matters of law, as in this case where the obtaining of intellectual property protection was of central importance to the commercial development of Mr Allen's ironing board (cf Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali [2001] UKHL 8 ; [2002] 1 AC 251 at 282, per Lord Clyde).'</text>

<text>In McNamara v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal [2005] HCA 55 ; (2005) 221 CLR 646 at 661 [40] McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ discussed the construction of a section which had been re-enacted in the same words in new legislation. They departed from the construction of the earlier legislation in a previous decision of the High Court and said: 
 
 'It would be an error to treat what was said in construing one statute as necessarily controlling the construction of another; the judicial task in statutory construction differs from that in distilling the common law from past decisions (see Ogden Industries Pty Limited v Lucas [1970] AC 113 at 127; Brennan v Comcare (1994) 50 FCR 555 at 572.)'

 ' But that does not mean that the courts of Queensland, when construing the legislation of that State, should slavishly follow judicial decisions of the courts of another jurisdiction in respect of similar or even identical legislation. The duty of courts, when construing legislation, is to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. The primary guide to understanding that purpose is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of the legislation. Judicial decisions on similar or identical legislation in other jurisdictions are guides to, but cannot control, the meaning of legislation in the court's jurisdiction. Judicial decisions are not substitutes for the text of legislation although, by reason of the doctrine of precedent and the hierarchical nature of our court system, particular courts may be bound to apply the decision of a particular court as to the meaning of legislation.'

<text>The principle of election operates to hold a party to a position it has communicated to the other party as the choice that it has made between two inconsistent rights. Communication of the choice cannot occur in a factual vacuum. The circumstances and context of the communication affect how a reasonable person in the position of the other party would understand it. A landlord accepting rent ( Matthews v Smallwood [1910] 1 Ch 777 per Parker J) or a fire insurer, exercising rights to take possession of the insured's damaged premises ( Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305 per Knox CJ, Isaacs and Starke JJ) acting unilaterally, could not say that it was acting 'without prejudice'.</text>

(emphasis added)

In my respectful opinion, although his Honour did not have the benefit of the reasoning in Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; 237 ALR 512 , which was delivered subsequently to the reasons in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 , the reasoning of Mason P is plainly wrong. In addition, Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was decided on different legislation: see McNamara 221 CLR at 661 [40]; Walker Corporation 242 ALR at 391 [31]. I am of opinion that the non-compliance by Allphones with its obligations under cl 11 of the Code did not make the franchise agreement void. That non-compliance is a factor which, had Hoy Mobile wished to do so, could have been raised by it to seek relief under s 87 of the Act. It would defeat the evident purpose of the Code if Allphones were entitled to rely on its own breach of its obligation imposed under cl 11 to deny a franchisee with whom it had entered into a contract, the entitlement to enforce that contract against it or to seek a variation of it or relief from it under the Act. For these reasons I reject Allphones' argument that the franchise agreement is void.</text>

<text>Allphones also argued that cll 15 and 16 operated to prevent Hoy Mobile relying on any election, by Allphones to keep the franchise agreement on foot, which was not in writing. Because of my findings above it is not necessary to consider the application of R v Paulson [1921] 1 AC 271 at 282-283 to cll 15 and 16 on which Hoy Mobile relied.

<text>However, their Honours' comments were obiter, since they had already acknowledged that that was not a case where the party attempting to rescind was in breach of a condition or had otherwise repudiated. And they said that they did not need to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effect of a breach on a party's right to rescind: see Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479F. They recognised that, although a party in breach of a non-essential term was not prevented from rescinding for a fundamental breach or a repudiation by the other party, there may be an exception where a causal relationship existed between the breaches of non-essential terms by the party attempting to rescind and the fundamental breach relied on: Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479G-480B referring to Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613. When Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA said in the passage, which I have quoted, that a party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach, they relied on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in State Training Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277. There, Kerr LJ (with whom Lloyd and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed: Golodetz [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 286) said that where both parties had obligations which had to be performed concurrently but neither was dependent upon the other: 
 
 'Since both obligations are (assumedly) in the nature of conditions, both parties had an equal right, so long as the other party's obligation remained unperformed, to treat the other party as having wrongfully repudiated.'

In Kyrwood v Drinkwater [2000] NSWCA 126 at [154] Powell JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed at [1]; see also the dissenting view of Fitzgerald JA at [231]-[251]) said: 
 
 'In Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613 it was held by this Court that, if non-compliance with a contractual obligation is to take away the defaulting party's right to terminate, there must be a direct causal relationship between the non-compliance and the failure to complete, the onus of proving which lies on the non-defaulting party, and there must be an absence of repudiation by the defaulting party prior to that time .

<tocase>Paal Wilson &amp; Co v Partenreedere Hannah Blumenthali [1983] 1 AC 854</tocase>
<text>At common law, a party who brings an action for breach of contract must show that he is ready and willing to perform his part of the concurrent acts: Cohen &amp; Co 24 CLR at 298 per Isaacs J. Where, at least in English law, both parties to a contract are in breach of a mutual obligation owed by each to the other, neither can rely upon the other's breach as giving him a right to terminate, following the decisions of the House of Lords in Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v South India Shipping Corp Ltd [1981] AC 909 at 978-988A per Lord Diplock, with whom Lords Edmund-Davies and Russell of Killowen agreed; Paal Wilson &amp; Co v Partenreedere Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 908H-909F per Lord Brandon of Oakbrook with whom the other members of the House agreed in separate speeches.

In Paal Wilson [1983] 1 AC at 915C-916D Lord Diplock discussed the entry of both parties to an executory contract into a 'new contract' which he styled 'the contract of abandonment'. He explained that in such a case, each party promises by words or conduct to release the other from further performances of obligations on its part which remain to be performed, including the obligation to pay damages. And in Australian law the parties to a contract can so conduct themselves that they can be seen to have mutually abandoned or abrogated the contract; for example where neither takes any steps to perform over a period: see Summers v The Commonwealth [1918] HCA 33 ; (1918) 25 CLR 144 at 151-152 per Isaacs J; DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423 at 434 per Stephen Mason and Jacobs JJ; Foran 168 CLR at 422-423 per Brennan J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/31.html</AustLII>
<text>There is a danger in approaching commercial relationships with an overlay of equitable considerations. The relationship between the parties here arose in the contractual settings of the franchise agreement and the Code. Indeed, cl 12 of the franchise agreement expressly stated that the relationship between the parties was not one involving agency, partnership or joint venture. Nor does the Code create a fiduciary relationship between franchisor and franchisee. The necessity to identify the precise content of an alleged fiduciary relationship was emphasised by McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan in Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (in liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at 198-199 [77] - [79] . Here, each party expected to earn profit by its own efforts.

While it was in the joint interests of Allphones, and the franchisees, for Allphones to negotiate the best terms it could with carriers, the first question for consideration is what the terms of cll 7.3 and 7.4 require Allphones to do on their proper construction. If the contractual claims made by Hoy Mobile for the right to receive payments under one or other of those clauses in respect of the monies identified by it are correct, then it is not necessary to consider whether any fiduciary relationship existed. I propose to approach the problem in this way.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/10.html</AustLII>
<text>I am satisfied that Allphones was responsible for the diversion of calls from Hoy Mobile's territory of Eastgardens because of, first, the inappropriate programming by Zintel from March 2006 and, secondly, from October 2006 its own failure to correct what it knew was a problem. I am satisfied that Hoy Mobile lost the opportunity to make some sales from calls to the 138000 number during the period of the diversion. I am also satisfied that this loss had some value. Where there has been an actual loss of some sort, the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money to defeat an award of damages: see Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4 ; (1992) 179 CLR 332 at 349-350 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. However, it is not possible to make any precise calculation of the value of this loss, which included payments under cll 7.3 and 7.4 and the ongoing right to receive MTAC. Doing the best I can, I find the value of this to be the loss of about 1% of the sales of the Randwick store made during the period of the diversion. That results in a past loss of about $900, but this amount excludes any MTAC which Hoy Mobile would have earned after March 2007 on those sales. Although there is some guesswork involved, I find the total loss of Hoy Mobile as a result of the diversion to be $1,500: see generally Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [37] - [38] per Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Kirby JJ agreed: Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at 569-570 [35] - [36] per Black CJ and Jacobson J, at 581 [99]-[101] per myself.</text>

<text>Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ held that the analogue of s 51AC required the Court to focus primarily on the unconscionable conduct of the corporation and to determine whether that conduct was contrary to the norm of conscientious behaviour. They held that the conduct in that case insisted of a carefully formulated and systematic approach which clearly offended against basic notions of good conscience and fair play: National Exchange at 148 FCR at 143 [44]. Although their Honours were speaking of s 12CC of the ASIC Act , their remarks apply equally to the notion of 'unconscionable conduct' in its analogue, s 51AC: Cannon Australia Pty Ltd v Patton [2007] NSWCA 246 at [43] per Campbell JA, with whom Harrison J agreed. Campbell JA had referred ([2007] NSWCA 246 at [40]) to the earlier decision of a Full Court of this Court in Hurley v McDonald's Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 1728 ; (2000) ATPR 41-741 at [21] - [22] . There Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ said that for conduct to be regarded at an unconscionable, serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable had to be demonstrated. They found that the term carried with it the meaning given by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, namely '... actions showing no regard for conscience, or that are irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable', relying on Qantas Airways Ltd v Cameron [1996] FCA 1483 ; (1996) 66 FCR 246 at 262.</text>

<tocase>R v Burdett (1820) 4 B &amp; Ald 95</tocase>
<text>There is a balance of deductions from Hoy Mobile's commissions that comes to $3,581.49, which the experts agreed related to the credit charge fees, EFTPOS fees, IT fees, or late banking fees. However, they were unable to allocate that sum among the individual categories. In my opinion, it was for Allphones to justify its deductions. Hoy Mobile has established that Allphones made substantial deductions from commission amounts it was paid without a contractual basis. Mr Nicoll could have given evidence as to any basis for reducing the unallocated balance but did not. And, in their reports neither Mr Nicoll nor the two expert accountants could allocate the sums involved. Hoy Mobile has discharged any onus on it: Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 64; [1774] EngR 2 ; 98 ER 969 at 970; Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ and see too at 233 per Brennan and Toohey JJ; R v Burdett (1820) 4 B &amp; Ald 95 at 161-162 per Abbott LCJ at 140 per Holroyd J; 106 ER 873 at 898 and 890.

<tocase>R v Paulson [1921] 1 AC 271</tocase>
<text>Allphones also argued that cll 15 and 16 operated to prevent Hoy Mobile relying on any election, by Allphones to keep the franchise agreement on foot, which was not in writing. Because of my findings above it is not necessary to consider the application of R v Paulson [1921] 1 AC 271 at 282-283 to cll 15 and 16 on which Hoy Mobile relied. However, their Lordships indicated that the issue depends on the facts for they said, as Owen J pointed out in Owendale Pty Ltd v Anthony [1967] HCA 52 ; (1967) 117 CLR 539 at 610, that '[i]t may well be that many cases may occur to which the clause as to waiver would be applicable' before saying that, in that case, it was not: see too Owendale 117 CLR at 590 per Taylor J with whom Barwick CJ agreed on this issue at 569; per McTiernan J at 581; per Kitto J at 581-582.

<text>Thirdly, the franchise agreement with Hoy Mobile distinguished between the franchised premises for Hoy Mobile, the shop, and the territory. It would be commercially absurd for Allphones to contract, as in cl 2, that it would not operate a franchised business in 'the Territory' where that territory was a leased shop of which its franchisee had exclusive possession: Radaich v Smith [1959] HCA 45 ; (1959) 101 CLR 209. So much was recognised by Mr Donnellan when he said in evidence: 
 
 'You can't go and open, I mean fundamental tenancy law, you can't go and open within the lease line of a lessee's premises. We didn't hold the lease.' 
 

 3.3 Findings regarding territory

For the reasons I have given, I do not accept either Mr Hoy or Mr Donnellan's account of his conversation with the other concerning what the territory was to be. The remaining possibilities are that 'N/A' was literally the territory agreed between the parties, so that there was no territory at all; or that there was some other meaning of territory. Allphones argued that the agreement could work perfectly well without the specification of a territory. I reject that argument. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have considered that the exclusive territory, to which cl 2 of the franchise agreement referred, was an essential term. In doing so, they would be mindful, both, that the China Lakes agreement had used a simple means of defining the territory by making it the suburb in which the franchised premises were, and that the Code required specification of, first, a territory, and secondly, whether the territory was exclusive, non-exclusive or limited to a particular site (Annexure 1 of the Code, cl 8.1). In that specification, the Code recognised that a 'particular site' was different to an exclusive territory.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1961/72.html</AustLII>
<text>Mason CJ applied what Dixon CJ had said in Rawson v Hobbs [1961] HCA 72 ; (1961) 107 CLR 466 at 481 (see Foran 168 CLR at 405-406). Dixon CJ had said in Rawson 107 CLR at 481 (Windeyer J agreed at 107 CLR at 492): 
 
 'One must be very careful to see that nothing but a substantial incapacity or definitive resolve or decision against doing in the future what the contract requires is counted as an absence of readiness and willingness. On the other hand it is absurd to treat one party as tied to the performance of an executory contract although the other has neither the means nor intention of performing his part when his turn comes, simply because his incapacity to do so is not necessarily final or logically complete.'

Brennan J ( Foran 168 CLR at 424) said: 
 
 'Where a party claims to be entitled to rescind an executory contract on account of the other party's repudiation (whether by way of anticipatory breach or incapacity), the first party must show not only the other's repudiation but his own readiness and willingness up to the time of rescission to perform his essential obligations under the contract: [ Rawson 107 CLR at 480-481] ... Since a party's right to rescind an executory contract for the other party's repudiation is limited to cases where the first party is ready and willing to perform, neither party is treated as without fault where both would be at fault were the contract to continue until the time for performance arrives .' (emphasis added)

He too applied what Dixon CJ had said in Rawson 107 CLR at 481, see Foran 168 CLR at 425. When Brennan J referred to an entitlement to rescind, he used 'rescind' in the sense of one party electing to terminate for breach or repudiation by the other, as explained in Commissioner of Taxation v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 22 at [2] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.</text>

<tocase>Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v CAN 053 006 269 Pty Ltd (Receiver &amp; Manager Appointed) (1997) 42 NSWLR 462</tocase>
<text>Neither party was evincing loyalty to its contractual promises. In Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v ACN 053 006 269 Pty Ltd (Receiver &amp; Manager Appointed) (1997) 42 NSWLR 462 at 481B-C Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA, in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales said: 
 
 'A party in breach of non-essential terms who has not repudiated may rescind for fundamental breach: see Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26; State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [[1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277] (at 286-287). A party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach: see State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd (at 285-287); compare Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (1992) 11 WAR 40 at 50-51. Roadshow , we consider, was not, by reason of its conduct, unable to terminate on the ground of CEL/Vision's repudiation.'

However, their Honours' comments were obiter, since they had already acknowledged that that was not a case where the party attempting to rescind was in breach of a condition or had otherwise repudiated. And they said that they did not need to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effect of a breach on a party's right to rescind: see Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479F. They recognised that, although a party in breach of a non-essential term was not prevented from rescinding for a fundamental breach or a repudiation by the other party, there may be an exception where a causal relationship existed between the breaches of non-essential terms by the party attempting to rescind and the fundamental breach relied on: Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479G-480B referring to Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613. When Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA said in the passage, which I have quoted, that a party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach, they relied on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in State Training Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277. There, Kerr LJ (with whom Lloyd and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed: Golodetz [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 286) said that where both parties had obligations which had to be performed concurrently but neither was dependent upon the other: 
 
 'Since both obligations are (assumedly) in the nature of conditions, both parties had an equal right, so long as the other party's obligation remained unperformed, to treat the other party as having wrongfully repudiated.'

In Kyrwood v Drinkwater [2000] NSWCA 126 at [154] Powell JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed at [1]; see also the dissenting view of Fitzgerald JA at [231]-[251]) said: 
 
 'In Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613 it was held by this Court that, if non-compliance with a contractual obligation is to take away the defaulting party's right to terminate, there must be a direct causal relationship between the non-compliance and the failure to complete, the onus of proving which lies on the non-defaulting party, and there must be an absence of repudiation by the defaulting party prior to that time . 
 

 
 
 The same approach was taken by this Court in Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v CEL/Vision (ACN 053 006 269) Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 462 at 479-480.'

In Emhill Pty Ltd v Bonsoc Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] VSCA 108 at [68] - [69] Warren CJ, with whom Buchanan and Ashley JJA agreed said: 
 
 ' [68] N C Seddon and M P Ellinghaus state in Chesire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (8th ed, 2002) [at 943]: 
 

 
 
 A party need only be ready and willing to perform the contract in substance. A party who is in breach may nevertheless have the right to terminate, so long as the breach is not repudiatory or of an essential term or such as to deprive the other party of the substantial benefit of the contract. 
 

 
 
 This is the view espoused by the learned judge below and supported by Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v CEL Home Video Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 462 at 470 480 [sic]. 
 

 
 
 [69] The question then becomes whether Emhill had repudiated the contract, breached an essential term of the contract or deprived the other party of the substantial benefit of the contract.' (emphasis added)

While the dicta of the Court of Appeal in Roadshow Entertainment 42 NSWLR at 481B-C are of great weight, I am of opinion that on analysis, they are inconsistent with the considered, albeit equally obiter dicta views of three of the justices: Foran 168 CLR at 405-408 per Mason CJ, 424, 427 per Brennan J and 452, 454 per Dawson J.</text>

In particular, an appreciation of the commercial purpose of a contract: ( Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-6; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574)

<tocase>Scarf v Jardine (1882) 7 App Cas 345</tocase>
<text>In his classic speech in Scarf v Jardine (1882) 7 App Cas 345 at 360-361 Lord Blackburn discussed the principles upon which the doctrine of election had developed. He said that where a person had an option to choose one or other of two inconsistent things, when once he or she had made his or her election, it cannot be retracted: Scarf 7 App Cas at 360. He emphasised that the election had to be communicated ( Scarf 7 App Cas at 361): 
 
 '... to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made that choice, he has completed his election and can go no further; and whether he intended it or not, if he has done an unequivocal act I mean an act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the person concerned is an election.'

And, his Lordship said that where there is a right to elect '... the party is not bound to elect once; he may wait and think which way he will exercise his election, so long as he can do so without injuring other persons ...' ( Scarf 7 App Cas at 360, emphasis added). Lord Blackburn emphasised that election involved, first, the making of the choice between one of two inconsistent rights and, secondly, the notification or communication of that choice to the party against whom the rights existed in a way that affected that other party. Hence, in Immer 182 CLR at 43 Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ referred to the party being '... confronted with the necessity of making a choice'.

In Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 at 55 Kitto J said that the person with the choice might keep the question open '... so long as it did nothing to affirm the contract and so long as the [other party's] position was not prejudiced in consequence of the delay'. He said that when the vendor in that case told the purchaser that it would not rescind a contract for the sale of land before a particular date if the purchaser paid an additional sum for interest, costs and expenses, the vendor was doing no more than promising that it would not elect to rescind the contract before that date if the conditions were complied with. Kitto J said that in that case a grant of an extension of time was not an election to affirm but, rather, amounted to an announcement of an intention to refrain from electing either way until the money had been paid or the extended time for performance had elapsed: see too Champtaloup v Thomas [1976] 2 NSWLR 264 at 268C-269B per Glass JA; 273D-274D per Mahoney JA; Street CJ agreeing with both at 266: Hunter BNZ Finance v GC Maloney Pty Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 420 at 435C-436B per Giles J: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 89-92 [356] - [364] per Finn J. And, as the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber written by Blackburn J (see Scarf 7 App Cas at 360) established, this principle applies to a party to a contract who discovers his entry into it was induced by the fraud of the other: Clough v London &amp; North Western Railway Co (1871) LR 7 Ex 26 at 34-35. 22.2 Consideration</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/51.html</AustLII>
<text>In general, each party to a contract agrees, by implication, to do all that is necessary on its part to enable the other party to have the benefit of the contract: Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying what Griffith CJ had said in Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68 at 70-71. A duty to co-operate is not always implied. Whether it will be is a question of construction based on an objective consideration of the whole of the terms of the contract: Secured Income 144 CLR at 607-608 per Mason J. Here, the work to refresh the Eastgardens store included the new Optus broadband display cabinet. Since Optus paid Allphones the money in order to achieve the installation of that work, it was necessary for Allphones, when exercising its contractual power to impose a reasonable charge for the work, to apply Optus' payment in reduction of the amount Hoy Mobile had to pay.

I am of opinion that cll 4, 6.23 or 6.35 and the franchise agreement as a whole, entitled Allphones to charge Hoy Mobile for no more than the reasonable cost to it of the work required for the fit out. If Allphones received money from carriers to do some of the fit out or refresh work or to defray its cost, it could not use any contractual power to reimburse itself by charging its franchisee with a sum greater than the reasonable cost that Allphones had incurred. The powers in the franchise agreement, on which Allphones relied to impose and charge for the store refresh, did not authorise it to make a profit from Hoy Mobile by requiring it to effect the store refresh for the benefit of a carrier, like Optus, yet retaining co-op sums paid by the carrier to Allphones to defray the very cost of that fit out. These clauses entitled Allphones to act reasonably for the purpose of giving effect to them. They did not confer a power to act capriciously. Allphones led no evidence to justify the reasonableness of the round figure of $10,000 as the charge it sought to impose on the franchisees, including Hoy Mobile.

Both parties had to co-operate to bring about the refresh. Hoy Mobile had to permit the shopfitters access to its store, and pay for the reasonable cost of the work. Allphones had to arrange for the work to be designed and carried out, as well as to fix a charge which was a reasonable reflection of the cost it incurred in respect of the refresh. It was not entitled to profit by use of its powers under the franchise agreement to impose a reasonable charge as cost of the work to be done.</text>

However, it is not possible to make any precise calculation of the value of this loss, which included payments under cll 7.3 and 7.4 and the ongoing right to receive MTAC. Doing the best I can, I find the value of this to be the loss of about 1% of the sales of the Randwick store made during the period of the diversion.

In Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v ACN 053 006 269 Pty Ltd (Receiver &amp; Manager Appointed) (1997) 42 NSWLR 462 at 481B-C Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA, in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales said: 
 
 'A party in breach of non-essential terms who has not repudiated may rescind for fundamental breach: see Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26; State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [[1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277] (at 286-287). A party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach: see State Trading Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd (at 285-287); compare Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd (1992) 11 WAR 40 at 50-51. Roadshow , we consider, was not, by reason of its conduct, unable to terminate on the ground of CEL/Vision's repudiation.'

However, their Honours' comments were obiter, since they had already acknowledged that that was not a case where the party attempting to rescind was in breach of a condition or had otherwise repudiated. And they said that they did not need to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the effect of a breach on a party's right to rescind: see Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479F. They recognised that, although a party in breach of a non-essential term was not prevented from rescinding for a fundamental breach or a repudiation by the other party, there may be an exception where a causal relationship existed between the breaches of non-essential terms by the party attempting to rescind and the fundamental breach relied on: Roadshow 42 NSWLR at 479G-480B referring to Nina's Bar Bistro Pty Ltd v MBE Corporation (Sydney) Pty Ltd [1984] 3 NSWLR 613. When Gleeson CJ, Handley JA and Brownie AJA said in the passage, which I have quoted, that a party in breach of an essential but independent term may also rescind for fundamental breach, they relied on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in State Training Corporation of India Ltd v Golodetz Ltd [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep 277. There, Kerr LJ (with whom Lloyd and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed: Golodetz [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 286) said that where both parties had obligations which had to be performed concurrently but neither was dependent upon the other: 
 
 'Since both obligations are (assumedly) in the nature of conditions, both parties had an equal right, so long as the other party's obligation remained unperformed, to treat the other party as having wrongfully repudiated.'

However, what his Lordship said there appears to have been obiter dicta, for he pointed out that it did not matter which party was first to treat the other as having repudiated, since neither lost its right to claim damages for the breaches by the other, irrespective of which of them brought the contract to an end ( Golodetz [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 287). Other parts of Kerr LJ's judgment have been disproved by the House of Lords: Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd (The Santa Clara) [1996] AC 800 at 812A-B.</text>

<tocase>Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1950/35.html</AustLII>
<text>Wilmot LCJ's words are taken from his judgment in Collins v Baltern (1767) 2 Wils 347 at 351. They reflect a principle which still runs through the common law of identifying fault as an appropriate basis for the court exercising its power to grant or withhold relief. In Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418 at 441, Latham CJ, Williams and Fullagar JJ discussed a contractual power to avoid a contract in circumstances where the consent of a third party, there the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, had not been obtained within a particular time. They said that in that case, the event in question could be brought about by the failure on the part of either party to take certain necessary steps, or it could be brought about without default by either party. They concluded that the latter situation applied in that case, but determined that the clause made the contract not void, but voidable saying: 
 
 ' The question of who may avoid it depends on what happens. If one party has by his default brought about the happening of the event, the other party alone has the option of avoiding the contract . If the event has happened without default on either side, then either party may avoid the contract. But neither need do so, and, if one party having a right to avoid it does not clearly exercise that right the other party may enforce the contract against him.' (emphasis added) 
 

 
Their Honours applied this reasoning as an extension of the principle that no party, directly or indirectly, may take advantage of his own wrong.

In essence, Allphones' behaviour in relation to the payment of commission amounted to it evincing an intention not to take seriously its obligations to pay MTSC in accordance with cll 7.3 and 7.4 the franchise agreement. Its conduct was that of a person who evinced an intention that he was prepared to carry out his part of the contract if and only when it suited him and, in the way that it suited him. That was a repudiatory breach which continued over virtually the whole time in which Hoy Mobile was in breach: see Carr v JA Berriman Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 31 ; (1953) 89 CLR 327 at 351-352 per Fullagar J with whom the rest of the Court agreed.

A party to a contract cannot act with impunity in a way which amounts to a refusal to be bound. Allphones concealed its underpayment of commission by a continuing deceit. Its action in doing that month after month, evinced an intention not to adhere to its promise to pay commission in accordance with the provisions of cll 7.3 and 7.4. This is not a case of a bona fide mistake in interpretation. No bona fide interpretation of a contract could justify Allphones' electronic manipulation of material data to disguise the true position.

Here, Allphones' cumulative failures for over two years to account to Hoy Mobile for all of the commissions Hoy Mobile had earned from activations generated by its conduct of the franchise business, evinced an intention by Allphones not to be bound by the franchise agreement itself. Rather, Allphones evinced an intention to carry out that contract as and when it pleased. Mr Donnellan's evidence indicated that, as the chief executive officer, he saw it as open to Allphones to determine how and in what way it would perform its obligations in relation to the sharing of commissions. The evidence satisfies me that Allphones in fact did choose which commissions earned through activations of mobile telephone services generated by the sales of Hoy Mobile and other franchises would be shared. It did this regardless of the common understanding of Allphones and Hoy Mobile that cl 7 operated, as I have found, to cover all earnings of commissions from sales to customers in the stores of carriers' plan products, however the carriers paid those commissions (i.e. directly to the stores or to Allphones).</text>

<text>Where one of the parties to a contract has committed a fraud in its performance, the fraudster cannot complain that he or she has been prejudiced by acts of the other party done without sufficient knowledge of his or her fraud. That is why the courts have always held that fraud fundamentally affects the way in which relations between parties are viewed. As Denning LJ said in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702 at 712 (see also SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64 at 68 [15] - [16] ):

<tocase>Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi [2003] HCA 57 ; (2003) 217 CLR 315</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/57.html</AustLII>
<text>In Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi [2003] HCA 57 ; (2003) 217 CLR 315 at 324-325 [20] - [22] , Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ said that the word 'unconscionable' involved the concept of unconscientious conduct. They said that the conscience which equity considers for these purposes is a 'properly formed and instructed conscience', citing Gleeson CJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 227 [45] . The onus is on the party alleging that the other has engaged in unconscionable conduct, so as to prevent the latter's exercise of its contractual rights to terminate. In this respect, the Code specifically permitted termination without notice where a franchisee was fraudulent in connection with the operation of the franchise business (cl 23(f)). However, for reasons unexplained, Allphones instead issued a notice of intention to terminate the franchise agreement on seven days' notice, rather that pursuant to cl 9.3(viii) which permitted termination in the circumstances without notice. A consequence of termination under cl 10 of the franchise agreement would be the transfer, at Allphones' request, of the lease of the shop premises at Eastgardens (cl 10.1(x)).

The equitable jurisdiction to prevent an unconscientious assertion of legal rights by one party under a contract against the other is usually exercised only where the circumstances include one of the special heads of that jurisdiction, namely: fraud, accident, mistake or surprise: Tanwar 217 CLR at 335 [58]. Where accident or mistake is not involved, it is usually necessary to point to some conduct of the party asserting the rights which in some significant way has caused the other party to be in the position of being confronted by that assertion. It is not necessary that the circumstances be exceptional before equity will intervene, but the party challenging the assertion of the rights must show why it would against conscience (unconscientious) for the other to proceed: Tanwar 217 CLR at 335 [58]-[60].

The statutory jurisdiction under sub-ss 51AC(1) and (2) of the Act has a broader reach than its equitable counterpart (see also s 51AA(2)). The non-exclusive range of matters to which the Court may have regard in sub-ss 51AC(3) or (4) suggest that the Parliament was concerned not to restrict the operation of the norm of conduct in sub-ss 51AC(1) and (2), simply to the focus which equity has on whether the corporation (as the party asserting the right) has caused the business consumer or small business supplier to be in the position where the corporation's right is available to be asserted.

Thus, here, equity would consider whether Allphones had caused Hoy Mobile to be fraudulent in connection with the operation of the franchise agreement (cl 9.3(viii)). On the facts, I have found Mr Hoy alone was responsible for that fraudulent conduct of Hoy Mobile. So, equity would not find a nexus between Allphones' entitlement to terminate and the fraud in which Hoy Mobile had engaged. 33.2 Consideration</text>

<tocase>The Ophelia [1916] 2 AC 206</tocase>
<text>Allphones suggested that the benefit received by Mr Hoy may have been greater than he claimed. It pointed to the fact that Mr Hoy had destroyed the handwritten receipt books containing the records from which his profit could be calculated. Where a person deliberately destroys a document that, depending upon which its contents may have been, would have told strongly either for or against the person, the strongest possible assumption arises that if it had been produced, the document would have told against the person. This is so even if there was no intention to destroy evidence. The principle is that the person is in the position that they would have been in without the corroboration which might otherwise have been expected: Allen v Tobias [1958] HCA 13 ; (1958) 98 CLR 367 at 375 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Williams JJ, applying The Ophelia [1916] 2 AC 206 at 229-230.</text>

<text>A reasonable person in the position of the parties here would reject as inappropriate a construction of their franchise agreement that it had no territory at all. The task of construing 'N/A' as the description of the territory must be approached in the manner described by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ; applied in International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 242 ALR 47 at 63 [53] per Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. That requires the Court to put to one side the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about the rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations, and to concentrate on the principle of objectivity for the ascertainment and definition of those rights and liabilities. Their Honours said that what mattered was what each party, by words or conduct, would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. They continued: 
 
 'References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreements. The meaning of the terms of the contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction ( Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at 461-462 [22] .)'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/20.html</AustLII>
<text>In Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 at 55 Kitto J said that the person with the choice might keep the question open '... so long as it did nothing to affirm the contract and so long as the [other party's] position was not prejudiced in consequence of the delay'. He said that when the vendor in that case told the purchaser that it would not rescind a contract for the sale of land before a particular date if the purchaser paid an additional sum for interest, costs and expenses, the vendor was doing no more than promising that it would not elect to rescind the contract before that date if the conditions were complied with. Kitto J said that in that case a grant of an extension of time was not an election to affirm but, rather, amounted to an announcement of an intention to refrain from electing either way until the money had been paid or the extended time for performance had elapsed: see too Champtaloup v Thomas [1976] 2 NSWLR 264 at 268C-269B per Glass JA; 273D-274D per Mahoney JA; Street CJ agreeing with both at 266: Hunter BNZ Finance v GC Maloney Pty Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 420 at 435C-436B per Giles J: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 89-92 [356] - [364] per Finn J. And, as the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber written by Blackburn J (see Scarf 7 App Cas at 360) established, this principle applies to a party to a contract who discovers his entry into it was induced by the fraud of the other: Clough v London &amp; North Western Railway Co (1871) LR 7 Ex 26 at 34-35. 22.2 Consideration

Through neither party's fault, a meeting was unable to be arranged between 7 July and 22 August. During that period, Hoy Mobile wished the contract to remain on foot while Allphones had indicated that it was keeping its options open until Hoy Mobile had had an opportunity to explain its, prima facie, fraudulent conduct. A reasonable person in Hoy Mobile's position could not have understood Allphones' conduct at this point to amount to an affirmation of the franchise agreement. Both parties were still pursuing the course of holding a meeting for the purposes set out in Mr Donnellan's letter of 7 July. That course was being pursued with Hoy Mobile's full knowledge, and indeed at its request, through Mr Birch's email of 10 July to that effect. And, neither Mr nor Mrs Hoy gave evidence that they understood that Allphones had chosen to affirm during this period. Allphones was not making a choice of affirming the franchise agreement, while holding matters in abeyance pending the meeting at which Hoy Mobile could explain its position. Rather (as Kitto J observed was permissible in Goonan 111 CLR at 55) Allphones had said that it intended to refrain from electing until the meeting occurred. Nor, in fairness to Hoy Mobile, was Allphones required to make a choice before that meeting had occurred: Immer 182 CLR at 41.

Of course, there are limits to the ability of a party to a contract to act 'without prejudice' to the legal consequences of those acts in the particular relationship. Unlike a landlord accepting a payment of rent and thus electing to waive reliance upon any pre-existing breach, Allphones did not communicate an unequivocal intention that the franchise agreement remain on foot. Rather, at Hoy Mobile's request Allphones had agreed to postpone making an election until the meeting occurred: cp: Goonan 111 CLR at 55. In that context, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that Allphones was acting on the basis that it was acceding to Hoy Mobile's request to postpone making an election. It was not electing once for all by its conduct in offering and requiring performance pending the meeting to make a choice. Allphones, in the context in which the parties then found themselves, was not evincing by its actions an unequivocal choice to keep the franchise agreement on foot and not to terminate it.

I find that both parties proceeded on the agreed footing that Allphones would refrain from terminating for fraud until the meeting, ultimately arranged for 22 August 2006, had occurred. Both parties knew that, in the interim, they had to carry out the normal incidents of their relationship under the franchise agreement.</text>

<text>The process of construction is intended elucidate and give effect to what the parties by their words or actions objectively conveyed to one another was their agreement. Courts seek to avoid being the destroyers of bargains and should be reluctant to find agreements void for uncertainty. The process of construction will result in a meaning which the court decides is the proper construction of the contract. As Barwick CJ emphasised in Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 436-437, in the search for the parties' intention, no narrow or pedantic approach is warranted, particularly in the case of commercial agreements. Unless parties have expressed themselves in such a way that their terms are so obscure or incapable of any definite or precise meaning so that the Court cannot attribute to them any particular contractual intention, the Court will find a meaning which an objective person in the position of the parties at the time they entered into the contract would have understood them to have intended: see also Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN 001 452 106 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2000] HCA 25 ; (2000) 202 CLR 588 at 599 [15] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia ( CEPU ) v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 510 [164] - [166] , 511 [171], 512 [174] per Weinberg and Bennett JJ and myself.</text>

<text>In McNamara v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal [2005] HCA 55 ; (2005) 221 CLR 646 at 661 [40] McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ discussed the construction of a section which had been re-enacted in the same words in new legislation. They departed from the construction of the earlier legislation in a previous decision of the High Court and said: 
 
 'It would be an error to treat what was said in construing one statute as necessarily controlling the construction of another; the judicial task in statutory construction differs from that in distilling the common law from past decisions (see Ogden Industries Pty Limited v Lucas [1970] AC 113 at 127; Brennan v Comcare (1994) 50 FCR 555 at 572.)' 
 

 
And, in Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5 ; (2008) 242 ALR 383 at 391 [31] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ applied McHugh J's comments in Marshall v Director-General, Department of Transport [2001] HCA 37 ; (2001) 205 CLR 603 , where he said (at 632-3 [62]):
 
 
 ' But that does not mean that the courts of Queensland, when construing the legislation of that State, should slavishly follow judicial decisions of the courts of another jurisdiction in respect of similar or even identical legislation. The duty of courts, when construing legislation, is to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. The primary guide to understanding that purpose is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of the legislation. Judicial decisions on similar or identical legislation in other jurisdictions are guides to, but cannot control, the meaning of legislation in the court's jurisdiction. Judicial decisions are not substitutes for the text of legislation although, by reason of the doctrine of precedent and the hierarchical nature of our court system, particular courts may be bound to apply the decision of a particular court as to the meaning of legislation.' (emphasis added)

In my respectful opinion, although his Honour did not have the benefit of the reasoning in Baxter Health Care [2007] HCA 38 ; 237 ALR 512 , which was delivered subsequently to the reasons in Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 , the reasoning of Mason P is plainly wrong. In addition, Ketchell [2007] NSWCA 161 was decided on different legislation: see McNamara 221 CLR at 661 [40]; Walker Corporation 242 ALR at 391 [31]. I am of opinion that the non-compliance by Allphones with its obligations under cl 11 of the Code did not make the franchise agreement void. That non-compliance is a factor which, had Hoy Mobile wished to do so, could have been raised by it to seek relief under s 87 of the Act. It would defeat the evident purpose of the Code if Allphones were entitled to rely on its own breach of its obligation imposed under cl 11 to deny a franchisee with whom it had entered into a contract, the entitlement to enforce that contract against it or to seek a variation of it or relief from it under the Act. For these reasons I reject Allphones' argument that the franchise agreement is void.</text>

<tocase>Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315</tocase>
<text>In Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319 McLelland CJ in Eq said: 
 
 'Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive (which I will compendiously described as "misleading") within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act ), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was; and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading. Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances. In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition. Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience. 
 

 
 
 Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the court, which means that the court "must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence". Such satisfaction is "not ... attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved" including the "seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding": Helton v Allen [1940] HCA 20 ; (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 712. 
 

 
 
 Considerations of the above kinds can pose serious difficulties of proof for a party relying upon spoken words as the foundation of a causes of action based on s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act ), in the absence of some reliable contemporaneous record or other satisfactory corroboration.'

His Honour's observations as to the frailty of human memory are, of course, not to be taken as limited simply to cases invoking claims under the Trade Practices Act or its analogues. They are just as apposite in a case such as this where the question arises of what oral terms of the contract were agreed in the course of negotiations.

The franchise agreement recited that Allphones had developed a system of doing business in association with its intellectual property and distinctive method and style for operating the franchised businesses. Clauses 1 and 2 of the franchise agreement provided that Allphones had granted Hoy Mobile the right, and the latter accepted, the obligation to operate a franchise business: 
 
 'Right to conduct franchise 
 

 1. ... within the Territory referred to in the Schedule hereto (hereafter called "the Territory") in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
 
 
 Exclusivity 
 

 The Franchisor must not itself operate or licence another to operate a Franchised Business in the Territory. The Franchisee must not canvass sales outside of the Territory.'

The franchise agreement was to commence in August 2003 and run for a period of five years with an option to renew for a further term of five years (cl 3). Allphones was entitled to develop and change the system and intellectual property which it used in the conduct of its overall franchise business (cl 4). Hoy Mobile, among other obligations, agreed not to do or permit anything during the term of the franchise agreement or thereafter which might detract from Allphones' reputation or goodwill or be misleading or deceptive or otherwise cause confusion (cl 5.8). The franchise agreement provided that Allphones had sole and absolute discretions:

Importantly, cl 6.5(ii) provided: 
 
 'Stock supplied by [Allphones] to [Hoy Mobile] in terms hereof is supplied on consignment, and at the cost of delivery of [Hoy Mobile], and shall at all times be subject to the control of Allphones Point-of-Sale and inventory computer system ...' (sic)</text>

<text>There is a balance of deductions from Hoy Mobile's commissions that comes to $3,581.49, which the experts agreed related to the credit charge fees, EFTPOS fees, IT fees, or late banking fees. However, they were unable to allocate that sum among the individual categories. In my opinion, it was for Allphones to justify its deductions. Hoy Mobile has established that Allphones made substantial deductions from commission amounts it was paid without a contractual basis. Mr Nicoll could have given evidence as to any basis for reducing the unallocated balance but did not. And, in their reports neither Mr Nicoll nor the two expert accountants could allocate the sums involved. Hoy Mobile has discharged any onus on it: Blatch v Archer [1774] EngR 2 ; (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 64; [1774] EngR 2 ; 98 ER 969 at 970; Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ and see too at 233 per Brennan and Toohey JJ; R v Burdett (1820) 4 B &amp; Ald 95 at 161-162 per Abbott LCJ at 140 per Holroyd J; 106 ER 873 at 898 and 890. Since Allphones did not justify any portion of this balance as a fee payable by Hoy Mobile, the whole amount claimed by it should be paid by Allphones.. 25.5 Retention canvassing</text>

<tocase>Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd v Craine [1922] 2 AC 541</tocase>
<text>Allphones also argued that cll 15 and 16 operated to prevent Hoy Mobile relying on any election, by Allphones to keep the franchise agreement on foot, which was not in writing. Because of my findings above it is not necessary to consider the application of R v Paulson [1921] 1 AC 271 at 282-283 to cll 15 and 16 on which Hoy Mobile relied. However, their Lordships indicated that the issue depends on the facts for they said, as Owen J pointed out in Owendale Pty Ltd v Anthony [1967] HCA 52 ; (1967) 117 CLR 539 at 610, that '[i]t may well be that many cases may occur to which the clause as to waiver would be applicable' before saying that, in that case, it was not: see too Owendale 117 CLR at 590 per Taylor J with whom Barwick CJ agreed on this issue at 569; per McTiernan J at 581; per Kitto J at 581-582. And, in any event, contractual provisions like cll 15 and 16 are strictly construed: Craine 28 CLR at 325-326; affirmed in Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd v Craine [1922] 2 AC 541 at 546; (1922) 31 CLR 27 ; see too Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners v Hancock [1927] HCA 26 ; (1927) 39 CLR 570 at 584 per Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J; 589 per Isaacs J; 590 per Rich J; and 594 per Starke J.</text>

<tocase>Zhu v Treasurer of NSW (2004) 218 CLR 53</tocase>
<text>It is necessary to construe an agreement so as to avoid making it commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience: Zhu v Treasurer of NSW [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ. In Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd (2006) 71 IPR 212 at 235-237 [103]-[108] I referred to the principles applicable to the construction of contracts. I am of opinion that the genesis of the franchise agreement, the background context and market in which the parties were operating were all relevant, as known to both of them, for the purpose of construing what was intended to be referred to by the use of 'N/A' in describing the territory. There is no evidence that the terms of the franchise agreement as settled between the parties was the subject of drafting, before execution, by lawyers.

Of course, at common law the courts cannot make a contract for the parties which they did not make for themselves (cp: s 87(2) of the Trade Practices Act ). But commercial contracts '... ought to be construed fairly and liberally for the purpose of carrying out the object of the parties': Duncan v Koster; The Teutonia (1872) LR 4 PC 171 per Mellish LJ at 182, applied by Isaacs J in Cohen &amp; Co v Ockerby &amp; Co Ltd [1917] HCA 58 ; (1917) 24 CLR 288 at 300. Isaacs J went on to hold that expressions in a mercantile contract are not to be read narrowly, but as the Court would suppose two honest business people would understand the words they actually used with reference to their subject matter and the surrounding circumstances: Cohen &amp; Co 24 CLR at 300. And the Court construes a commercial contract to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience: Zhu 218 CLR at 559 [82] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ.</text>
