<text>This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, given on 15 December 2008 and published as MZYAV v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1728. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application seeking review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), the second respondent to the appeal. The Tribunal dismissed an application for review of a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), the first respondent to the appeal, refusing to grant to the appellant a protection visa.

The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He arrived in Australia on 23 September 2007. On 2 November 2007 he applied for a protection visa. The decision of the Minister's delegate was given on 14 January 2008. The appellant then applied to the Tribunal for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate. On 18 March 2008, the Tribunal conducted a hearing at which the appellant attended and was represented by a migration agent. The Tribunal's decision was signed on 7 May 2008 and handed down or sent to the appellant on 21 May 2008. The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court on 6 June 2008. He filed an amended application on 21 July 2008. His application was listed for hearing on 13 November 2008 but was adjourned until 15 December 2008 to enable the appellant to consider his case and seek legal advice. He appeared without representation at the hearing on 15 December 2008. The federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application and ordered that he pay the Minister's costs, fixed at $5,000.

By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to call these two documents, taken together, the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country</text>
