<tocase>Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821</tocase>

<text>1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Phipps FM): Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821. In hearing and determining the appeal, I am exercising the powers of the Full Court pursuant to a determination by the Chief Justice under s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

2 Phipps FM dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice served on him by the respondent. Before the Magistrate, the appellant put forward three bases for the setting aside of the notice.

3 The first basis was that the notice was based on a debt that had been paid.

24 Leaving aside the gratuitous insult in ground (h), the Magistrate was hardly obliged to deal with an issue that was not raised before him. It follows that I also do not need to deal with it. Grounds (b) and (h) must fail. In any case, I agree with what Hayne J said to the appellant about the issue in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2004] HCATrans 562: 
 "These arguments are variants on arguments that have sometimes been put in the Court. They are arguments that always end up proving far too much, Mr Moran, as they are arguments that, if they had any legs which they do not it would demonstrate that there was no ownership of land, there was no Corporations Law, and the arguments of a kind commonly deployed to demonstrate that somebody does not owe taxation. It always proved too much."

25 Ground of appeal (c) relates to the note. It must also fail.

26 The Magistrate said at [5] that:
 "A promissory note does not constitute payment for costs, It was returned by [solicitors for the respondent] by return mail in which they said it did not constitute legal tender. A promissory note cannot constitute payment in the absence of acceptance of the promissory note or agreement that payment is to be made by promissory note. Neither of those two things exist here. In addition, there is no evidence of an ability to satisfy the promissory note. Finally, it needs to be said, the order for costs made by the Court of Appeal contained no stay, nor did the Master's order fixing the amount of the costs. The promissory note, on its face, is payable at 4pm on 31 January 2025. ..."</text>

<tocase>Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/223.html</AustLII>
<text>11 According to the appellant, grounds of appeal (a) and (g) fix on what the Magistrate said at [15] and [16]:
 "[The appellant] is seeking to satisfy the Court that he has a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as those terms are used in s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). It is not sufficient for a debtor to assert that he has a claim and then set out the basis for the claim. He must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand. The Court must be satisfied it has a reasonable prospect of success. I refer to Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [52] as one of the authorities for that proposition. The debtor must show that he has a prima face case even if he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case (Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 at 350). 
 
 The [appellant] does not show that he has a claim to pursue. He has attempted to establish a claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria and the proceeding has been dismissed. He has lodged an appeal against the decision of Mandie J, but that does not establish that his claim has any merit or any prospects of success, whether he has a prima facie case or a reasonable prospect of success." 
 

As noted at [6], the appeal against the decision of Mandie J is stayed pending the provision of security for costs.

12 Ground of appeal (a) is misconceived. The Magistrate did not "assume the outcome of [that] appeal". He did what the authorities (ie Bhagat and Ebert ) called upon him to do: namely, make an assessment solely for the purposes of the application before him of the prospects of success of the appeal. In making that assessment, he did not purport to decide the outcome of that appeal: the Court of Appeal is not bound to agree with that assessment if and when it comes to decide the appeal. Further, the Magistrate could only have made that assessment on the basis of "submissions and affidavit material".</text>

<tocase>Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/27.html</AustLII>
<text>16 As to the first proposition set out at [14], the appellant contends that the Magistrate cannot exercise the jurisdiction of a state court. (Presumably, that contention is made in reliance on Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511.) However, the Magistrate did not purport to do that. All he did was record as part of the task described at [12] what Master Evans had said about the claim. In so doing, he referred to an affidavit of Robert McGirr of solicitors for the respondent which reference is the subject of the second proposition set out at [14]. However, the appellant relied on Mr McGirr's affidavit before the Magistrate having exhibited it to an affidavit of his own. It does not lie in the appellant's mouth to now complain that Mr McGirr's affidavit was used against him even if he only intended to rely on it in some respects and not others.

17 Grounds of appeal (e) and (f) relate to the substance of the claim which the Magistrate described at [8] to [11].

18 According to the appellant, ground of appeal (e) fixes on what the Magistrate said in the last sentence at [12]:
 "The only avenue open to [the appellant] was as a lessee, but that would only be if his lease was granted with the approval of the first mortgagee, which it was not." 
 

The appellant complains that this amounts to a ruling on a crucial issue in the claim: namely, who was the first mortgagee of a property located at Clarkes Hill that was sold by the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506</tocase>
<text>34 The appellant relies on the following passage in PP McQuade and MGR Gronow, McDonald , Henry and Meek: Bankruptcy Law and Practice (5 th edn, 1996) at [40.1.335]:
 "A creditor who, after he or she has served a bankruptcy notice, takes from the debtor a bill of exchange or promissory note for the debt, cannot, during the currency of the bill or the note, obtain a sequestration order founded on the notice, since, until the bill or note is dishonoured, it must be treated as payment (Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506) and the position is the same, if, although dishonoured, it is in the hands of a third person to whom it has been endorsed for value by the creditor: Re Debtor [1908] 1 KB 344." 
 

That passage does not assist the appellant. It assumes that the creditor has accepted the note. That the author uses the word "take" in that sense is made clear when one reads the two cases to which he refers. In each of those cases, the note had been accepted. For the same reason, each of those cases can be distinguished from the instant case.</text>
