<tocase>Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1885.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 21 December 2005 I gave judgment in this matter: see Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885. I dismissed the application. This judgment concerns the costs of that proceeding.

2 The third, fourth, fifth and sixth respondents (the Commonwealth respondents) seek costs of the proceeding, and that their costs be fixed under O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules in a gross sum. The second respondent, Mr Price, seeks similar orders.

3 The interests of the Commonwealth respondents, and of Mr Price, were not identical. They were separately represented by solicitors and counsel. Mr Dunstan has not suggested that was inappropriate. In my view, it was appropriate for them to be separately represented. To the extent to which they are entitled to costs of the proceeding, I consider that separate orders for costs should be made.

21 Mr Dunstan also argued that the Commonwealth respondents had failed to give proper discovery in the course of the conduct of the proceedings. He said that somehow disentitled them from recovering costs. The material shows that Mr Dunstan sought supplementary discovery by notices given on 12 and 20 June 2003. Directions were given on 1 August 2003 for the hearing on 14 November 2003 of the disputed issues about discovery. That application was not pressed on 14 November 2003, as Mr Dunstan was confronted with an application by the Commonwealth respondents to strike out the statement of claim. He was given further time to formulate the terms of his proposed pleading. Ultimately, on 19 March 2004, he was directed to provide further particulars of the pleading and was refused leave to amend it in certain respects: Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2004] FCA 284. Further directions were given for the preparation of the matter for trial; the issue of further discovery was not revived by Mr Dunstan. Those matters do not indicate any sinister conduct on the part of the Commonwealth respondents. Nor do they reveal any factors which, in my view, weigh in the scales either at all, or certainly not sufficiently, to decline to make the orders for costs which I propose to make.

22 Order 62 r 4(2)(c) entitles the Court to order that any costs which are ordered shall be in a gross sum specified in the costs order.</text>

<tocase>Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc (1986) 8 ATPR 40</tocase>
<text>19 I have no hesitation in concluding that both the Commonwealth respondents and Mr Price should be entitled to their costs of the proceeding on a party/party basis. They have successfully resisted Mr Dunstan's claims. There is no reason, in my view, not to apply the normal rule that costs should follow the event: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748. There were no significant issues upon which they did not succeed: cf Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166. Their conduct did not unreasonably prolong the hearing; the reverse is the case: cf Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 544. There is no other conduct on their part which, in my view, would disentitle them from any of their party/party costs.</text>

<tocase>Charlick Trading Pty Ltd v Australian National Railways Commission [2001] FCA 629</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/629.html</AustLII>
<text>24 Factors which have been considered when exercising the discretion to make such an order include 
 
 . where the delay, expense and inconvenience of taxing costs in the normal manner would be unduly protracted or unduly expensive: Beach at 120; Charlick Trading Pty Ltd v Australian National Railways Commission [2001] FCA 629 ( Charlick ); Foyster v Foyster Holdings (2003) 44 ACSR 705; and
 . where the financial capacity of the party liable to pay costs is such that the additional cost of taxation will impose a significant burden on the party in whose favour costs are ordered without real prospects of recovering those costs: Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 ; Sparnon v Apand Pty Ltd (unreported, von Doussa J, 4 March 1998); Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith (2005) ALR 788. 

There are other considerations to which the Court has had regard, but they are not said by any party to arise in the present matter.

41 Mr Chapman then made an adjustment or reduction of 20 per cent on the amount he had arrived at. He did so firstly to reflect that some of the work carried out might not be regarded as recoverable on a party/party basis although it would properly be recoverable as solicitor/client costs. He used the figure approved in Charlick of 15 per cent as a guide. Secondly, the reduction was to reflect his caution that he may not have detected all work done for other related matters and that there may be further work done by various solicitors on the file which may not be regarded as recoverable on a party/party basis. There is no direct evidence in this matter that the 'usual' or common difference between party/party costs and solicitor/client costs on taxation is 15 per cent. Mr Chapman has not addressed that. The difference sometimes arises because there are different chargeable rates allowed on taxation on different bases. That does not arise here, as the scale hourly rates have been applied. Allowance should nevertheless be made for the fact that some work properly carried out for the purposes of solicitor/client taxation may be excluded for the purposes of party/party taxation. I have reached the view that Mr Chapman's reduction of 20 per cent is a proper one. No matters were put to him in cross-examination to suggest some other overall reduction should be made. Nor was any submission made by Mr Dunstan that some other specific deduction should be made on this aspect. That reduction represents a conservative approach, in Mr Dunstan's favour, as the weeding out process by Mr Chapman should have excluded most of the items which should not be included in party/party costs on this matter. I propose, however, to increase that reduction to 30 per cent to allow, again in Mr Dunstan's favour, for the possibility that calculating costs on an hourly scale rate might result in the costs being higher than those which would be allowed on normal taxation. The 30 per cent reduction covers that contingency, as I consider the 20 per cent deduction proposed by Mr Chapman for the other factors he has referred to is generous to Mr Dunstan.

42 Mr Chapman has added an allowance for the general care and conduct of the matter, pursuant to item 41 of the Second Schedule to the Rules. In my view, some allowance for general care and consideration should be made in respect of the costs to be allowed for the Commonwealth respondents. They were confronted with claims for three separate causes of action requiring extensive documentary review and proofing of witnesses. The factual issues extended over a lengthy period. Mr Dunstan's allegations in his pleadings and affidavits were very detailed, descending into the minutiae of communications and relying often upon subtle nuances of meaning of communications. That is not said as a criticism of him; that was in part the foundation of his claims. It nevertheless required extensive and very careful investigation and consideration of the responses of the various persons involved, the preparation of their affidavits of evidence, and of course the mastering of all that material for the purpose of briefing counsel and giving instructions at the hearing, as well as for giving advice to the Commonwealth respondents from time to time.

43 I do not think the amount of the care and consideration allowance should be determined by benchmarking against other cases. The comparison is too difficult. It may be unreliable without a detailed knowledge of the respective cases. Mr Chapman has allowed 17.5 per cent in this matter, but by a benchmarking process. I think that allowance is an appropriate one, but for the reasons I have given rather than simply by a form of benchmarking.</text>

There are other considerations to which the Court has had regard, but they are not said by any party to arise in the present matter.

29 I also consider that the expense of taxation in the normal way, which would be incurred by the respondents, is unlikely to be recoverable from Mr Dunstan: see e.g. Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628. He has now no interest in any real estate. There is nothing to suggest he has any other significant assets which might be available, even to meet any costs order. Mr Dunstan is presently imprisoned. He has no immediate prospects of employment, even if he secures release on parole shortly. The consequence of taxation is that the respondents would incur further significant expense to quantify their entitlement to those costs when that further expense is likely to be irrecoverable from Mr Dunstan.

30 Mr Dunstan's contentions focused on the need for the Court to be satisfied that a particular gross sum for costs represented only those costs which were necessary or proper for the attainment of justice or for maintaining or defending rights of the respondents (O 62 r 19). He then submitted that the evidence of Kim Chapman, a costs consultant, should be rejected, and that the Court should not fix a gross sum for costs because it should be satisfied that the bills of costs of the defendants in matters ACD 31 of 1997 and 32 of 1997 were both over-generous and unreliable, and that there was no reason to think the quantification of the costs applications in this matter were of a different character.</text>
