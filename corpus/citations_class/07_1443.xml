<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Melbourne Asset Management Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1994) 49 FCR 334</tocase>
<text>46 The distinction between the status of court appointed liquidators and liquidators appointed under voluntary administrators, as a basis for the distinction between the language of s 479(3) and s 511 has long been recognised: see eg, Australian Securities Commission v Melbourne Asset Management Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1994) 49 FCR 334 at 348-349 (Northrop J); Deane-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209. In the latter case Young J said that: 
 
 ... the authorities tend to suggest that the court has the same jurisdiction under both sections...
 

The reasons advanced in those and other cases for the conferral of express powers in s 511 are supported by the comment on one of its many predecessors, s 274 of the Uniform Companies Act 1961, in Wallace and Young, Australian Company Law and Practice (Law Book Co, 1965) at 759: 
 
 the effect of this section (which the court has interpreted so as to give it wide powers) ... is to lessen the distinction between a voluntary and compulsory winding up.</text>

The reasons advanced in those and other cases for the conferral of express powers in s 511 are supported by the comment on one of its many predecessors, s 274 of the Uniform Companies Act 1961, in Wallace and Young, Australian Company Law and Practice (Law Book Co, 1965) at 759: 
 
 the effect of this section (which the court has interpreted so as to give it wide powers) ... is to lessen the distinction between a voluntary and compulsory winding up.

50 Given the more substantive character of the applications contemplated by s 511(1)(a) the preceding observations are even more apposite in applications made under that provision. Whether the Court should proceed to entertain applications for the determination of substantive rights and award final relief as between competing creditors and others in an application under s 511, is a matter of discretion. As Young J said about s 511 in Deane-Willcocks 42 NSWLR 209 (at 212): 
 
 There are many questions where the only order that the court should make is that the liquidator or the claimant proceed in the ordinary courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute. However, there are many other situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in a cheap and efficient manner. Where this can be done it is "just and beneficial" to exercise the power.

51 In my opinion it is open to the Court, in a suitable case, to entertain an application for the determination of questions under s 511 by joining affected parties with competing interests as defendants and permitting them to file cross-claims for declaratory relief as between themselves and any other interested parties and the liquidator so that there can be a res judicata between all of them. Such a course may be appropriate where the evidence necessary to determine the questions and the competing claims is largely documentary and amenable to expeditious hearing and determination. Otherwise the parties can simply commence their own substantive proceedings.

52 On the basis of the information provided at the directions hearing and the nature of the factual matters underpinning the questions raised by the liquidator, it appears likely that the resolution of the competing claims reflected in the liquidator's questions could proceed expeditiously on a largely documentary basis. I accept that there may be some oral evidence going to questions of estoppel in relation to IMF. Although the proposed statement of claim outlines a somewhat complex and convoluted sequence of transactions, the heavy documentary emphasis suggests that a largely documentary case can be run.</text>

<text>48 A direction given or a question determined under s 479(3) or s 511, as the case may be, will protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination. In relation to a determination under s 511 it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are named as defendants in the application but neither direction nor determination gives rise to a res judicata as between parties who may have competing interests affected by it: Equity Funds of Australia (In Liq) (1977-78) CLC 40-303 at 29,253-29,254 (Bowen CJ (in Eq)). McLelland J said in GB Nathan &amp; Co 24 NSWLR 674 (at 677): 
 
 The protection of the official administrator, acting under a direction of the court, from personal liability would not however affect the rights of creditors and beneficiaries as between themselves. 
 

So far as s 479(3) is concerned, McLelland J was of the view that it does not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments and that the function of an application for directions under that section is to give the liquidator advice about the proper course of action in the liquidation and not to determine rights and liabilities arising from pre-liquidation transactions (at 679).

<tocase>Re GB Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (In liq) (1991) 24 NSWLR 674</tocase>
<text>47 The facilities provided by ss 479(3) and 511 have a long ancestry. Section 479(3) of the former Corporations Law was considered by McLelland J in Re GB Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (In liq) (1991) 24 NSWLR 674. He traced its origins back to the Joint Stock Companies Winding Up Act 1848 (UK) which allowed an official manager to apply for directions from the Master from time to time. A similar facility has long existed for trustees, administrators and executors. As McLelland J said (at 677):
 
 These various statutory provisions for directions were a development from the practice of the Court of Chancery under the general law in giving directions to those entrusted with the administration of property under the control of the court. Two main classes of such persons were (1) trustees of trust property, or executors or administrators of a deceased estate, under administration by the court pursuant to a decree for general administration, and (2) receivers (and managers) appointed by the court in respect of property the subject of litigation.

48 A direction given or a question determined under s 479(3) or s 511, as the case may be, will protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination. In relation to a determination under s 511 it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are named as defendants in the application but neither direction nor determination gives rise to a res judicata as between parties who may have competing interests affected by it: Equity Funds of Australia (In Liq) (1977-78) CLC 40-303 at 29,253-29,254 (Bowen CJ (in Eq)). McLelland J said in GB Nathan &amp; Co 24 NSWLR 674 (at 677): 
 
 The protection of the official administrator, acting under a direction of the court, from personal liability would not however affect the rights of creditors and beneficiaries as between themselves. 
 

So far as s 479(3) is concerned, McLelland J was of the view that it does not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments and that the function of an application for directions under that section is to give the liquidator advice about the proper course of action in the liquidation and not to determine rights and liabilities arising from pre-liquidation transactions (at 679). See also Re JW Murphy and PC Allen (1996) 19 ACSR 569 at 570 (McLelland CJ).

49 On the other hand there is sufficient flexibility in the procedures of the Court to enable proceedings begun as an application for directions to be converted into proceedings for the determination of substantive rights: Re GB Nathan &amp; Co 24 NSWLR 674 at 680. In Melbourne Asset Management Nominees 49 FCR 334, Northrop J said (at 352): 
 
 It has been accepted that Courts have power to make final orders in preference claims on an application by a liquidator under sections similar to s 479(3) of the Corporations Law . There is no logical reason why final orders binding on other persons cannot be made on applications under s 479(3) with respect to other subject matters.
 

And further (at 352): 
 
 
 I can see no reason why binding orders cannot be made where the parties affected have been given the opportunity to be heard.</text>
