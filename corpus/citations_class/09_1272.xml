<tocase>Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/27.html</AustLII>
<text>An appeal "on a question of law" is narrower than an appeal that merely "involves" a question of law. Where an appeal lies "on a question of law", the subject matter of the appeal is the question of law stated as required by Order 53 r 3(2)(b): Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at [11] and Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at [13] .

Section 44(1) of the AAT Act limits the capacity of the Court to review factual findings of the Tribunal. The subject matter of the appeal is, (shorn of the requirement to determine what, if any, entitlement to relief flows from the answer to the question or questions of law), of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law to the Court under s 45 of the AAT Act: Etheridge 149 FCR at [14].

A mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within s 44(1). Order 53 r 3(2) requires a question of law to be stated with precision as a pure question of law. It is in the specification of the grounds relied on in support of the orders sought that one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal: Etheridge 149 FCR at [16].

The questions of law said to be raised by the appeal are stated in the notice of appeal as follows: 
 
 (a) Whether the Tribunal properly applied the provisions of the relevant Statement of Principles concerning Depressive Disorder being instrument number 58 of 1998 ("the SoP");
 (b) whether the Tribunal has given any or any adequate reasons for its conclusions in relation to depressive disorder;
 (c) whether the Tribunal failed to consider all of the material and evidence before it when identifying the factual foundation upon which the Tribunal relied in reaching its decision in relation to depressive disorder;
 (d) whether it was open to the Tribunal to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence before it that there was no causal connection between the seasickness experienced by the Applicant on operational service and his war service and resultant depression;
 (e) whether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant matters when reaching its decision in relation to depressive disorder;
 (f) whether it was open to the Tribunal to find that the Applicant's seasickness was not war caused;
 (g) whether the Tribunal correctly applied the definition of disease and/or injury in s 5D of the Act;
 (h) whether the depressive disorder as diagnosed could be accepted as war caused under the relevant SoP.

The appellant contended that the Tribunal's reasons reveal two questions of law: 
(1) whether, having identified a stressor fitting within the definition of "severe psychosocial stressor" in clause 8 of the SoP the Tribunal was required to determine whether the stressor was related to service by applying s 196B of the Act, and
 
(2) whether the Tribunal was correct to hold that a pre-existing condition can never give rise to a stressor that is related to service within the meaning of s 196B.
 
It was said that these questions "are capable of falling within" questions (a) and (d) in the notice of appeal.

Order 53 r 3(2)(a), as interpreted by the Full Court in Etheridge 149 FCR at [16], requires a question of law to be stated with precision as a pure question of law. Question (a) in notice of appeal does not do that. It is ambiguous. It does not identify the manner in which the Tribunal failed properly to apply the SoP. The Tribunal may have made an error of fact, of mixed fact and law or of law, in applying the SoP.

<text>Section 13(1) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) (the Act) renders the Commonwealth liable to pay pension to a veteran who is incapacitated by a war-caused injury or a war-caused disease. The circumstances in which an injury or disease is taken to be war-caused are set out in s 9(1) of the Act. So far as relevant to the present case those circumstances are where the injury or disease resulted from an occurrence that happened while the veteran was rendering operational service: s 9(1)(a) or where the injury or disease arose out of or was attributable to any eligible war service (which includes operational service) rendered by the veteran: s 9(1)(b). Whether a veteran is suffering from an injury or disease, and the diagnosis of that injury or disease, is to be determined to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision-maker: s 120(4). Where, as in the present case, a claim relates to operational service, the standard of proof on whether an injury or disease is war-caused is prescribed by s 120(1) and (3). The question posed by s 120(3) is whether "the whole of the material" before the decision-maker raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the injury or disease with the circumstances of the veteran's service. Section 120(3) is affected by s 120A , which provides that a hypothesis connecting a person's injury or disease with the circumstances of any particular service is reasonable only if there is in force a Statement of Principles (SoP) that upholds the hypothesis. A hypothesis raised by the material will be reasonable only if it is consistent with, or fits the template of, the SoP: Repatriation Commission v Deledio [1998] FCA 391 ; (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 96.

At the time of the respondent's decision there was in force SoP Instrument No 58 of 1996 concerning depressive disorder. Clause 3 of the SoP states that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that depressive disorder can be related to relevant service rendered by veterans. Clause 4 states that at least one of the factors set out in clause 5 must be related to any relevant service rendered by the veteran. Clause 5 lists the factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting depressive disorder with the circumstances of a veteran's service. The only factor of present relevance is factor (b): 
 
 experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor or stressors within the two years immediately before the clinical onset of depressive disorder. 
 

 
The expression "severe psychosocial stressor" is defined as
 
 
 an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual, for example, being shot at, death or serious injury of a close friend or relative, assault (including sexual assault), severe illness or injury, experiencing a loss such as divorce or separation, loss of employment, major financial problems or legal problems.

The Tribunal found that the appellant served in the Royal Australian Navy from 7 July 1968 to 18 June 1971, and that his two trips to Vietnam on HMAS Sydney from 17 November 1969 to 5 December 1969 and from 16 February 1970 to 5 March 1970 were operational service. It was common ground that the appellant had a depressive disorder. The Tribunal described the hypothesis relied on by the appellant as follows: 
 
 the condition was war caused by the chronic sea sickness experienced during his operational service, with a resulting social isolation and depression at the possibility of being unable to serve at sea. 
 

 
The Tribunal identified the factor relied on as that in clause 5(b) of the SoP.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Yates [1995] FCA 1234 ; (1995) 38 ALD 80</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1995/1234.html</AustLII>
<text>His Honour also held that the recurrence of the symptoms was: 
 
 not an aggravation of the condition. A temporary presence of symptoms is not sufficient to show an aggravation within the meaning of the Act. 
 

 
In this connection his Honour relied on the observations of Lindgren J in Repatriation Commission v Yates [1995] FCA 1234 ; (1995) 38 ALD 80 at 88.

The appellant's third complaint that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider the hypothesis that the appellant's seasickness caused his depression was also dismissed. The Magistrate referred to the Tribunal's finding (recorded at [6] above) that the hypothesis of depression arising from severe seasickness was reasonable under the terms of clause 5(b) of the SoP, and to the first two sentences of the passage quoted at [6], and continued: 
 
 Thus while it is true, as Mr Cunningham asserts, that paragraph 9 of the Tribunal's reasons for decision rolls three independent hypotheses into one, the extract I have detailed shows that the Tribunal in fact did expressly consider the hypothesis that the seasickness caused the depression simpliciter.

His Honour then observed that it was "scarcely surprising" that the Tribunal had to an extent rolled three hypotheses into one, having regard to the way in which the case had been conducted, both in evidence and in submissions. He gave some examples at [66] to [69], and concluded: 
 
 the issue of the seasickness in the evidence before the Tribunal was intimately interrelated with the concerns of Mr Cunningham right from the inception of his more severe seasickness both that it caused social isolation and/or that it [led] him to be concerned about his future in the Navy. 
 

 
 
 Given that this is so it does not seem to me that the Tribunal can be overly criticised for approaching the matter in the way that it did. The fact that it did so in large part followed the Appellant's evidence and to an extent the submissions made by counsel on his behalf. 
 

 
 
 Thus the finding by the Tribunal that "constitutional predisposition was the cause of the seasickness and the subsequent depression on the realisation that his long-held ambition to be a sea going sailor was not to be achieved" was in my view open to the Tribunal on the materials and does not constitute an error of law.

His Honour noted that in view of his dismissal of all three complaints, he did not need to deal with the respondent's submission that the appeal was incompetent. This issue is dealt with in the ensuing paragraphs.

The appellant commenced his proceeding in this Court. Section 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act) provides: 
 
 A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding. 
 

 
Order 53 of the Federal Court Rules regulates the practice and procedure to be followed in respect of appeals from the Tribunal. Rule 3(2) requires that the notice of appeal state, among other things:
 
 
 (b) the question or questions of law to be raised on the appeal;
 (c) the order sought, and
 (d) briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought.

The proceeding was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to s 44AA of the AAT Act. Section 44AA(8) confers jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to hear and determine transferred appeals. Subsection (9) provides that s 44(4), (5) and (6) apply in relation to the hearing and determination of a transferred appeal in a corresponding way to that in which they apply to the hearing and determination of an appeal to this Court. Section 44(4) requires this Court to hear and determine the appeal and make such orders as it thinks appropriate. Subsection (5) empowers the Court to make orders affirming or setting aside the Tribunal's decision and an order remitting the case to be heard and decided again by the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/40.html</AustLII>
<text>I am not satisfied that the Tribunal's use of the expressions "not attributable to operational service" and "the cause of the seasickness" shows that it properly considered s 196B(14). The subsection is broader than "attributable" in par (b) and "cause" in par (f). Paragraph (a) was potentially applicable. It could be that the appellant's seasickness resulted from an occurrence (rough seas) on the way to Vietnam. The Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant's pre-existing disposition to seasickness was aggravated by his service (par (d)). Nor did it consider whether the seasickness "arose out of" his operational service (par (b)). In Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115 at [27] , in considering a provision in the same terms as s 169B(14)(b), the Court said the use disjunctively of the expressions "arose out of" and "attributable" manifests an intention to give "defence-caused" a broad meaning. What was there said in relation to the expression "defence-caused injury" is applicable to "injury ... related to service" in s 196B(14).

After noting that the Tribunal did not refer to s 196B(14), the Federal Magistrate observed that the "phraseology" in [10] of the Tribunal's reasons was "in some respects unfortunate". Nevertheless his Honour regarded that paragraph as containing "an unintended paraphrase of the requirements of" s 196B(14). I am unable to agree. According to the Macquarie Dictionary a paraphrase is a "restatement of the sense of a text or passage, as for clearness". The Tribunal's use of the words "attributable to" and "the cause" does not capture the sense of the relevant parts of subsection (14), and is not aptly described as a paraphrase.

It may well be that the explanation for the Tribunal's failure to refer expressly to s 196B(14) lies in the fact that the appellant's counsel, who did not appear on the present appeal, informed the Tribunal that the respondent's references to s 196B(14) were misplaced, and that the appropriate provision was s 9. That section deals with the circumstances in which an injury is to be taken to be a war-caused injury or disease. It is in some respects similar to s 196B(14). However, the Tribunal did not refer to s 9 either. As I have said, it was common ground on the appeal to this Court that it was necessary for the Tribunal to go through the "related to service" exercise in s 196B(14). It did not do so, and the ground of appeal related to the first amended question of law (namely par 2 of the notice) is made out.

The second amended question of law is whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that a pre-existing condition can never give rise to a stressor that is related to service within s 196B.

The Tribunal's reasoning on this issue is set out at [6] above. It involved the following steps:</text>

<tocase>White v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 633 ; (2004) 39 AAR 67</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/633.html</AustLII>
<text>In White v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 633 ; (2004) 39 AAR 67 Spender J considered the definition of "severe psychosocial stressor" in a SoP which was in similar terms to the definition in the instant SoP. At [30] his Honour said: 
 
 the definition of severe psychosocial stressor concerns an occurrence that, objectively, is an occurrence the nature of which is such as to evoke feelings of a particular kind in a person exposed to that occurrence and which, subjectively, evokes feelings of substantial distress in the particular person concerned. Both aspects are relevant and necessary. 
 

 
After observing that the Tribunal there had determined that the events relied on did not meet the objective requirement, his Honour continued at [32]:
 
 
 In my opinion, the submission on behalf of Mr White that an event which in fact evokes feelings of substantial distress in a person satisfies the definition of "severe psychosocial stressor" has to be rejected. Such a submission, that any occurrence no matter how trivial or innocuous it objectively is, can be a "serious psychosocial stressor", means that the examples given in the definition ... would be not only irrelevant and devoid of utility, but positively misleading.

As appears above, the Tribunal did not expressly address whether the appellant's seasickness was an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual. It had before it evidence from Dr Strauss that:

Before the Magistrate the respondent submitted that there was no evidence before the Tribunal that seasickness is a severe illness and therefore an occurrence which of its nature is objectively capable of evoking feelings of substantial distress. It said that Dr Strauss' evidence related only to the subjective effect of seasickness on the appellant. His Honour was referred to the observations of Spender J in White [2004] FCA 633 ; 39 AAR 67.

The Magistrate did not accept the respondent's submissions on this issue. He considered Dr Strauss' evidence "taken in the round and fairly was to the effect that seasickness is capable of being a severe illness". He noted that Dr Strauss found that the appellant's experiences and their ramifications were a severe psychosocial stress for him, and caused him significant or substantial distress. He referred to the dictionary definition of "severe" disagreeably intense, unpleasantly extreme; (especially of bad weather, illness, injury etc) causing hardship pain or suffering by its degree of extremity.

The Magistrate found that Dr Strauss' report evinced or was at least open to the interpretation that "he regarded these matters both objectively and as they affected Mr Cunningham individually". I agree with that reading of Dr Strauss' report. It is true that in his report he spoke of there having been a severe psychosocial stressor "for this man". But in cross examination he gave evidence about seasickness in the abstract, and said: 
 
 seasickness begins with nausea and travels through to very severe symptoms. But seasickness involves nausea. I think [that] ... can be quite severe and debilitating.</text>
