<tocase>Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/57.html</AustLII>
<text>22 This Court's jurisdiction to punish contempts arises from s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Section 31(1) confers upon the Court the same power to punish contempts as the High Court possesses. The section effectively declares that this Court has the contempt powers which are inherent in the judicial power of the Commonwealth: Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 at 395 [16] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.

23 The contempt charges in this case were laid in accordance with O 40 r 5 and r 6 of the Federal Court Rules . Counsel for Mr Spencer, Mr Bailey, argued that service of the Orders on Mr Spencer was irregular having regard to the provisions of O 37 r 2(1). However, that argument fails to take account of r 2(5). Sub-rule (5) permits a judgment or order to be enforced against a person by committal for contempt, notwithstanding that service has not been effected in accordance with r 2, where the person has notice of the judgment or order either by being present when the judgment is pronounced or when the order is made, or by being notified of the terms of the judgment or order by telephone, telegram or otherwise. In this case, Mr Spencer was represented by counsel when the Orders were made by Weinberg J. He had previously consented to and signed copies of the relevant orders. And shortly after the Orders were made, he was notified by his solicitor of the terms of the Orders. There was no failure to comply with O 37.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/3.html</AustLII>
<text>24 The applicant carries the onus of proof. The charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 (' Holloway' ) at 534; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v INFO4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 (' ACCC v INFO4PC' ) at 27-28 [4].

26 It is not necessary to prove any subjective intent to disobey an order of the Court: ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [10]; ACCC v Hughes at [20]. A deliberate commission or omission in breach of an injunctive order constitutes wilful disobedience and will amount to a contempt. Such a contempt is usually classed as a civil contempt. Depending on the circumstances, a deliberate act in disobedience of an order can amount to a criminal contempt. A contempt which is the result of an act of defiance, resulting in a deliberate breach of a court order, can be described as contumacious and as criminal in character: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 (' Mudginberri' ) at 108; Holloway at 530.</text>

<text>24 The applicant carries the onus of proof. The charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 (' Holloway' ) at 534; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v INFO4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 (' ACCC v INFO4PC' ) at 27-28 [4].

26 It is not necessary to prove any subjective intent to disobey an order of the Court: ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [10]; ACCC v Hughes at [20]. A deliberate commission or omission in breach of an injunctive order constitutes wilful disobedience and will amount to a contempt. Such a contempt is usually classed as a civil contempt. Depending on the circumstances, a deliberate act in disobedience of an order can amount to a criminal contempt. A contempt which is the result of an act of defiance, resulting in a deliberate breach of a court order, can be described as contumacious and as criminal in character: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 (' Mudginberri' ) at 108; Holloway at 530.

28 Thus, it will be sufficient to establish a contempt if it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the person in question was aware of the order and intentionally did an act, or omitted to perform an act, with the result that there was a breach of the order. An honest belief that a failure to act does not constitute a breach of an injunction is not a defence, but it may be relevant to penalty: see McNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd v Hinch [1985] VR 309 at 313-314; ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [10].

35 A person in Mr Spencer's position must strictly observe the terms of a Court order. It is not necessary for the Court to prescribe the manner in which the required result is to be achieved. It is sufficient if the Court clearly specifies that the respondent is to carry out a particular course of conduct: see ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [7]. There was nothing unclear or ambiguous about paragraph 13 of the Orders. Mr Spencer's obligation was to provide the documents in a form that could be accessed and read by the recipients. Mr Spencer did not comply with this requirement and his non-compliance was deliberate.

61 In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Spencer tendered an apology in similarly reserved and conditional terms. I consider that Mr Spencer has not shown any remorse for the fact that he wilfully disobeyed the Orders. Indeed, he has not acknowledged that he is in contempt of court. Through his counsel, Mr Spencer expressed his wish to 'rectify any remaining problems with his compliance with the orders.' In evidence, Mr Spencer added that he would 'rectify any and all points that the Court... says that I have not complied with in the orders.' I do not regard Mr Spencer's statement as one that affords any indication of regret, remorse or contrition about his contempt: it is merely an offer to do what Mr Spencer is in any event obliged to do under the Orders: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Simiton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 at [14] - [15] ; ACCC v INFO4PC at 57-58 [155].

67 Costs can be awarded on an indemnity basis where it is warranted by the interests of justice. In many contempt cases, the court has concluded that justice requires that the respondent pay the applicant's costs on an indemnity basis: Degmam Pty Ltd (in liq) v Wright (No 2) [1983] 2 NSWLR 354 at 358; and ACCC v INFO4PC at 58 [160]-[162].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/38.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Any contempt of court, including any wilful disobedience of the orders of the Court, is a very serious matter. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 (' ACCC v Hughes '), Tamberlin J said at [15]:
 
 'Ultimately, in the case of mandatory or prohibitory orders made by it, the sanction which the Court has in order to enforce its decisions is the power to punish for contempt. This is the way in which the Court preserves respect for its role and the rule of law. Without the enforcement of court orders the whole process of adjudication becomes a hollow exercise. If a losing party can defy the orders of the Court then such disobedience renders futile, in the perception of the community, the remedy secured by the successful party. Orders are not made simply to suggest or advise persons that they ought to keep to the law as proclaimed but to ensure that the law is carried out as determined by the decision pursuant to which the order is made. Defiance of court orders diminishes the authority of courts and removes the incentive of parties, if such conduct is left unpunished, to comply with the requirements of the courts.' 
 

Courts have repeatedly made statements to similar effect: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Globex Systems Pty Ltd (2005) 27 ATPR 42-069 (' ACCC v Globex' ) at 43,102 [54]; and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Hickey and Horne (1999) 42 ATR 229 (' Hickey' ) at 243 [35].

26 It is not necessary to prove any subjective intent to disobey an order of the Court: ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [10]; ACCC v Hughes at [20]. A deliberate commission or omission in breach of an injunctive order constitutes wilful disobedience and will amount to a contempt. Such a contempt is usually classed as a civil contempt. Depending on the circumstances, a deliberate act in disobedience of an order can amount to a criminal contempt. A contempt which is the result of an act of defiance, resulting in a deliberate breach of a court order, can be described as contumacious and as criminal in character: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 (' Mudginberri' ) at 108; Holloway at 530.

52 The applicant contended that the relevant form of disclosure document was the longer form in Annexure 1, but it proceeded to analyse Mr Spencer's compliance against the short form document in Annexure 2. It submitted that the document that Mr Spencer provided by way of a disclosure statement did not, on any view, comply with the requirements of Annexure 2. In particular, it submitted that it did not comply with Items 1 to 4, 9, 10 and 15 of Annexure 2 of the Code. In addition, the applicant argued that the previous franchise agreements contained ongoing obligations that survived termination, and it said that these obligations were not properly addressed in the short form disclosure document prepared by Mr Spencer. The applicant also submitted that Mr Spencer had made no attempt to contact the applicant, or to approach the Court, to clarify the nature and scope of his obligations in respect of the disclosure document: see ACCC v Hughes at [26].

53 To some extent, the applicant acknowledged that there were difficulties with paragraph 12 of the Orders. Notwithstanding its contention that there are deficiencies in the disclosure document provided by Mr Spencer, it does not press for an order that a further revised disclosure document be provided by Mr Spencer.

54 I am satisfied that there are difficulties with paragraph 12 of the Order. It is unclear what it requires of Mr Spencer. Once Mr Spencer appreciated the difficulties he confronted in complying with paragraph 12, the appropriate course for him to take would have been to raise those difficulties with the applicant and with the Court. But in all the circumstances, I am not prepared to find that Mr Spencer committed a contempt by the way in which he endeavoured to comply with paragraph 12 of the Orders.

55 The Court has a range of remedies available to it to ensure compliance with its Orders, including fines, sequestration of property and imprisonment: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews (1992) 32 ACSR 404 at 411; ACCC v Hughes at [28]; and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 67 IPR 611 (' Louis Vuitton '). Imprisonment is reserved for the most serious criminal contempt cases and is not appropriate here: see Keeley v Mr Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238 at 245; Hickey at 245-246 [38]-[39].</text>

68 The applicant brought these proceedings by notice of motion to ensure compliance with the Orders and consistently with its charter to act in the public interest: ACCC v Globex at 43,105 [84]. The applicant has been forced to take these extra steps to enforce its rights after they have already been adjudicated by the Court.

69 Mr Spencer had a duty strictly to comply with paragraph 13 of the Orders. He failed to do so and he is still in breach. He failed to take the necessary steps to comply with the Orders, notwithstanding correspondence from the applicant's solicitors warning that his failure amounted to a contempt. He was given ample opportunity to comply with the Orders.

70 I consider that it is appropriate in the interests of justice in this case to make an order that Mr Spencer pay the applicant's costs of and incidental to the notice of motion on an indemnity basis. I do not consider that my finding that the charge of contempt is not made out in respect of paragraph 12 of the Orders warrants me taking a different view as to costs.

71 I will make a declaration that Mr Spencer is in contempt of paragraph 13 of the Orders.

72 The remaining question is what course should be taken in relation to the further operation of paragraph 12 of the Orders. While the applicant submitted that paragraph 12 has been breached, it did not press for an order that would have the consequence that Mr Spencer is required to take further steps to comply with paragraph 12 of the Orders. In the circumstances, I propose to order that paragraph 12 of the Orders be vacated.
 I certify that the preceding seventy-two (72) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young J.

<text>26 It is not necessary to prove any subjective intent to disobey an order of the Court: ACCC v INFO4PC at 28 [10]; ACCC v Hughes at [20]. A deliberate commission or omission in breach of an injunctive order constitutes wilful disobedience and will amount to a contempt. Such a contempt is usually classed as a civil contempt. Depending on the circumstances, a deliberate act in disobedience of an order can amount to a criminal contempt. A contempt which is the result of an act of defiance, resulting in a deliberate breach of a court order, can be described as contumacious and as criminal in character: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 (' Mudginberri' ) at 108; Holloway at 530.

27 In Mudginberri, the High Court said at 113: 
 
 'It follows that a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual, accidental or unintentional.' 
 

In Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 201 (' Advan' ) at [45], Gillard J said that it is not a defence to a contempt proceeding to show that the disobedience came about by some casual or accidental or unintentional act; put another way, it is no part of the prosecution's proof to establish that the act or omission which breached the order was something that was not casual or accidental and was intentional. Gillard J said that the true meaning of the High Court's observation in Mudginberri is that if the evidence revealed that the breach was casual or accidental and unintentional, that would be relevant to whether or not the court should exercise its contempt jurisdiction. If the court is of the view that the charge of contempt is trivial or minor and lacks substance, or that the alleged contempt was casual or inadvertent and unintentional, even though technically established, the court would have a discretion to decline to exercise its jurisdiction. This accords with the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in Victoria in Re Perkins; Mesto v Galpin [1998] 4 VR 505 at 512-513.</text>

51 Counsel for Mr Spencer submitted that it is a condition of proving civil contempt that the terms of the relevant order are clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance: see Advan at [31]. In his submission, paragraph 12 of the Orders is unclear and ambiguous, and there is real doubt whether it was capable of being complied with by Mr Spencer on or after 8 February 2006.</text>

<tocase>Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 396</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/396.html</AustLII>
<text>36 It must be borne in mind that the persons to whom Mr Spencer was required to provide the documents were former franchisees of Contact Plus. Those persons had had a very unhappy experience with Contact Plus and Mr Spencer. Mr Spencer had threatened to commence legal proceedings against a number of the former franchisees: see Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 396 at [29] . The content of the 6 April email shows that Mr Spencer maintained considerable ill-will towards the intended recipients of the email. It also reveals that he felt aggrieved by the outcome of the proceedings and was antagonistic towards the applicant and the addressees of the email.

37 Paragraph 9 of the Orders provided that the facts set out in the attached statement of agreed facts constitute findings of fact for the purpose of s 83 of the Act. An obvious purpose of paragraph 13 of the Orders was, therefore, to inform those persons to whom the Orders were to be sent of the findings of fact that had been made against the respondents. Once informed of the findings of fact, they could take them into account in determining whether any, and if so what, action should be taken by them against the respondents to protect or assert their rights. The excision of the agreed statement of facts from every copy of the Orders that Mr Spencer provided must be seen in this light. I find that the excision of the agreed statement of facts was intentional.

38 In the course of cross-examination, Mr Spencer was asked to explain why it would not have been easy for him to send the Orders by email, without being password protected. His answers were as follows:
 
 'These people have been very, very difficult to deal with. Since 2003 I have constantly had this thing on my back. Constantly. No let up. These people have vexatiously sent emails on mass distribution lists. The copies were submitted in all this paperwork. They have been vexatious about this whole case right through. They are Ms Ford and Byron are not part of the ACCC action but they have been watching, commenting and even appearing at the back of one of my pre-motion hearings. They are aware of everything that has been going on and they cannot wait to stick it up me. Consequently this. To answer the question is that sending by email is not it is like throwing a dart. Closing your eyes and throwing at a dart board. Because the email address is alive today does not mean to say it has been redirected. It was a commercial email address, fordrec. I have no idea whether in the last two years I have had any contact with this lady whether she has moved, sold her business or whatever. If her email address was jillford@bigpond my answer to this gentlemen would have been I would have been more at ease sending it to a personal email address but not a commercial email address. 
 
 MR MOORE: My question could you explain to his Honour why it would not have been easy for you to send a document that was not password protected to the email address of Ms Ford? --- And my answer was I had no idea whether that email address was still active and I wanted to find out.'

39 Later in Mr Spencer's evidence, I asked him whether, in view of the feelings he had described towards Ms Ford and others, he had taken the view that he wanted to make it difficult for them to access the Orders, including the agreed statement of facts. His answer was: 'Absolutely not, your Honour, because I knew that they would do exactly what they did and use it against me.' I reject the denial in the first part of this answer.

40 Having carefully considered all of the evidence, I find that Mr Spencer took a series of steps, deliberately, to render it difficult for the recipients of the emails to access and read the terms of the Orders. He knew that the email recipients would be most unlikely to provide him with their personal details, including their current telephone number. He thought it most unlikely that they would take the steps he required to obtain access to the password. He knew that this would tend to defeat the purpose of the Orders, while allowing him to claim that he had technically complied with them. I am also satisfied that Mr Spencer deliberately excised the agreed statement of facts from the Orders. He did so because, as he said in evidence, he did not want the relevant persons to be able to use the agreed statement of facts against him.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/83.html</AustLII>
<text>55 The Court has a range of remedies available to it to ensure compliance with its Orders, including fines, sequestration of property and imprisonment: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews (1992) 32 ACSR 404 at 411; ACCC v Hughes at [28]; and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 67 IPR 611 (' Louis Vuitton '). Imprisonment is reserved for the most serious criminal contempt cases and is not appropriate here: see Keeley v Mr Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238 at 245; Hickey at 245-246 [38]-[39].

57 As discussed by Merkel J in Louis Vuitton at 616-617 [25], the range of factors to be considered in deciding the appropriate penalty include the following:
 
 (a) the contemnor's personal circumstances;
 (b) the nature and circumstances of the contempt;
 (c) the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice;
 (d) the contemnor's culpability;
 (e) the need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt; and
 (f) any prior conviction for contempt. 


I would emphasise that the Court's power in relation to contempt is to be exercised so as to ensure that orders are complied with, and to deter conduct in contravention of its orders.</text>

<tocase>Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1</tocase>
<text>58 In deciding the amount of any fine, the Court will take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1. The Court may suspend a fine on terms. In fixing the appropriate penalty, the Court will also take into account whether or not there is genuine contrition and whether or not a full and genuine apology has been given.

59 Having regard to my findings, I consider that the present case warrants a substantial penalty. There is an element in Mr Spencer's conduct that borders on defiance of the Orders. He deliberately adopted a series of steps that were designed to deny the benefit of the Court's Orders to the intended recipients of the documents. In my view, a penalty must be imposed that demonstrates to Mr Spencer, and to others, that the Court's orders cannot be disobeyed with impunity.

60 In his affidavit, Mr Spencer proffered an apology in these terms:
 
 'If, as a result of my misunderstanding, I have failed to comply in sufficient time with the orders I apologise to the Court. In all the relevant circumstances I believe I should be excused.'</text>

<tocase>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Simiton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/397.html</AustLII>
<text>61 In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Spencer tendered an apology in similarly reserved and conditional terms. I consider that Mr Spencer has not shown any remorse for the fact that he wilfully disobeyed the Orders. Indeed, he has not acknowledged that he is in contempt of court. Through his counsel, Mr Spencer expressed his wish to 'rectify any remaining problems with his compliance with the orders.' In evidence, Mr Spencer added that he would 'rectify any and all points that the Court... says that I have not complied with in the orders.' I do not regard Mr Spencer's statement as one that affords any indication of regret, remorse or contrition about his contempt: it is merely an offer to do what Mr Spencer is in any event obliged to do under the Orders: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Simiton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 at [14] - [15] ; ACCC v INFO4PC at 57-58 [155].</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jayco Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 94</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/94.html</AustLII>
<text>62 I have concluded that the appropriate penalty is to impose a fine of $8,000 on Mr Spencer in respect of the contempt constituted by his wilful breach of paragraph 13 of the Orders. This penalty is within the range suggested by the authorities: see ACCC v Globex; ACCC v INFO4PC ; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jayco Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 94.

63 I have taken account of Mr Spencer's personal circumstances. Mr Spencer said that he is currently unemployed and is not remunerated for the work he does as a director of CPG Recruitment Pty Ltd ('CPGR') or Debtregister Pty Ltd ('Debtregister'). He holds himself out to be the chief executive officer of Debtregister, although he said in evidence that he also fills the roles of marketing manager, software developer or whatever he wanted to call himself. He said the work he carries out for CPGR includes the preparation of quarterly BAS statements and the pursuit of various debts allegedly owed to CPGR. He said that the only person earning an income in CPGR is his wife, who is supporting him and his family.

64 In my view, Mr Spencer has not been forthcoming about his personal position and financial circumstances. There is, on the whole, insufficient evidence to suggest that the resources available to Mr Spencer would be inadequate to meet a fine of $8,000. Nor do I consider that the imposition of a fine of $8,000 would impose undue hardship upon him.</text>

<text>67 Costs can be awarded on an indemnity basis where it is warranted by the interests of justice. In many contempt cases, the court has concluded that justice requires that the respondent pay the applicant's costs on an indemnity basis: Degmam Pty Ltd (in liq) v Wright (No 2) [1983] 2 NSWLR 354 at 358; and ACCC v INFO4PC at 58 [160]-[162].</text>
